UZB_Vizier_Is_Dead_desc:0 "Junaid Khan, proud Yomud military commander and our “dear” leader for almost 20 years has finally succumbed to the withering of age and has passed away. The Khanate mourns as they prepare for the coming power struggle as the nation waits for the Khan to choose the next Vizier."

UZB_Young_Khiva_Revolution:0 "The Young Khiva Revolution"
UZB_Young_Khiva_Revolution_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Vizier Junaid Khan's peaceful death and with their leader, Bobo Ahun, chosen as Vizier, the Young Khiva Party has moved on the capital. Taking up the reigns power in the country, they have proclaimed the Republic of Khiva over the Khan’s denial of reform, bringing with them their democratic roots and emphasis on Jadidism."

UZB_The_Khanate_Lives_On:0 "The Khanate Lives On"
UZB_The_Khanate_Lives_On_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the tragic and sudden death of Vizier Junaid Khan, the ruling Khan Sayid Abdullah must choose a successor, who will ascend to the role of Vizier and try to continue to guide the Khanate in a royalist direction, despite the Khan’s inexperience."

UZB_Hold_Democratic_Elections:0 "Hold Democratic Elections"
UZB_Hold_Democratic_Elections_desc:0 "With the Young Khiva Revolution secure and their administration now established in the wake of the Vizier’s death, the first democratic elections for our newly-freed peoples will now soon be held to determine the future of this democratic project and Khiva as a whole."

UZB_Constitutional_Monarchy:0 "A Constitutional Monarchy"
UZB_Constitutional_Monarchy_desc:0 "Sayid Abdullah has for long been just a shadow to Vizier Junaid Khan's dictatorship, but with the ageing Vizier now dead, it is up to Abdullah to take the spotlight. The young man has little experience in governing a nation however, even one as small as Khiva and so the council has decided he shall have help. An influential and intelligent prime-minister, Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi, will be selected to help guide the Khan in his rule of the nation."

UZB_Absolute_Leadership:0 "Absolute Leadership"
UZB_Absolute_Leadership_desc:0 "Despite his inexperience and naivety, or perhaps because of it, Khan Sayid Abdullah decided to cast off the advice of the council and Vizier and instead shall rule Khiva with a firm hand. Under his new reign, the Khanate will embrace Kadimism and push to consolidate its strength in Central Asia."

UZB_Protect_Minorities:0 "Protect Minorities"
UZB_Protect_Minorities_desc:0 "Much like our neighbors in Bukhara and Kokand, the proud yet small state of Khiva is home to a slew of different ethnicities, cultures, and distinct groups who all live under the boot of the Uzbek regime. With our people’s revolution successful, our new democracy must work to alleviate the suffering of these minorities and protect them from hate."

UZB_Promote_Jadidism:0 "Promote Jadidism"
UZB_Promote_Jadidism_desc:0 "While Jadidism has little influence in Khiva, the Young Khiva Party has been strongly influenced by the Jadidist Young Bukhara movement in our neighbors to the South. Jadidism is a form of reformist, liberalized Islam belief, and we should promote this modernized strain of Islam across Khiva at once."

UZB_The_Home_of_Kadimism:0 "The Home Of Kadimism"
UZB_The_Home_of_Kadimism_desc:0 "Unlike its diametric opposite in Jadidism, Kadimism, or Islam Traditionalism, has held strong influence over Khivan citizens for generations. Emphasizing conservative traditionalism and strict adherence to old codices and decrees of the Muslim faith, our royal house shall double down on these ideals to foster unity and piety for the new dynasty of the Khanate."

UZB_Tighten_Control_Over_Khorezm:0 "Tighten Control Over Khorezm"
UZB_Tighten_Control_Over_Khorezm_desc:0 "We should eliminate the Young Khiva Party and its influence that pervades the region of Khorezm, before the foul taint of democracy that has been perverting the minds of Khivan citizens for years gains any more of a hold on them."

UZB_Support_Kokand:0 "Support Kokand"
UZB_Support_Kokand_desc:0 "The Republic of Kokand to the east should be our close ally in the fight against traditionalist Bukhara. Their deep democratic traditions mesh well with the ideals of the Young Khiva Party, and together we could bring democracy to all of Central Asia."

UZB_Support_Emir:0 "Support Bukhara"
UZB_Support_Emir_desc:0 "The Emirate of Bukhara has been our ally for many years, and with the continued reign of our Khantate’s monarchy under Khan Sayid Abdullah, our ideals are as aligned as ever. Our small state could use the Emirate in the struggle against Kokand, fighting together for the safety of all the people of the steppes."

UZB_Lead_Turkestan:0 "Lead the Turkestani"
UZB_Lead_Turkestan_desc:0 "It seems that both the democratic stronghold of Kokand and the bastion of conservative Islam in Turkestan have fallen under false flags and abhorrent ideas. In the wake of their failures, we shall take up the mantle of unfier of the steppes and consolidate the lands of a United Turkestan!"

### Events ###
khiva.1.t:0 "The Khanate of Khiva"
khiva.1.d:0 "The Khanate of Khiva has been a Russian protectorate since 1873. However, after the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, the myriad of liberal reforms that were planned were not performed, chiefly due to the conservative views of the Khivan Khan Isfandiyar. Later, the Khan was assassinated and the seat of power was eventually seized by the leader of the Turken tribes, Junaid Khan. He placed Sayid Abdullah, younger brother of Isfandiyar, as a puppet monarch. Junaid Khan himself became a Vizier, but he's been the de facto head of Khivan state for all these 18 years since his appointment. His aggressive foreign policy led to terrible defeats against the Reds, but the forces of marxists were not enough to defeat the Khan’s government. The Reds were defeated in Russia and Junaid Khan consolidated his rule as the dictator of Khiva. For 15 years he legislated numerous conservative and autocratic policies that helped Khiva to remain an agrarian, nomadic country in the middle of the desert. The opposition to the regime of Junaid Khan has been growing in the years since his rule began and it is becoming very dangerous for the 79-year old dictator, who can barely control the country as in, to perform his duties or even feel safe."
khiva.1.a:0 "Khiva Lives On!"

khiva.2.t:0 "Junaid Khan Is Dead!"
khiva.2.d:0 "The Vizier of Khiva, Junaid Khan has died of a stroke at the age of 79. Sayid Abdullah, Khan of Khiva, has now to decide who should make the new head of government. While Khan himself is a poor leader, as he has been a ceremonial figure for almost 20 years, he believes he is strong enough to install an absolute monarchy in the region, asking the Emir of Bukhara for support. On the other hand, Khiva is in strong need of modernization, and perhaps making the leader of the Young Khiva Party the new Vizier will benefit the Khanate. The third option is to make Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi, an honorable Khivan general and the main representative of the Basmachi movement in Khiva, the new grand Vizier to guide the inexperienced Khan."
khiva.2.a:0 "Bobo Ahun, Young Khiva leader."
khiva.2.b:0 "Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi, the leader of Basmachi."
khiva.2.c:0 "The Khan consolidates his rule as absolute monarch."

khiva.3.t:0 "Bobo Ahun Demands Constitutional Monarchy"
khiva.3.d:0 "The new Vizier, Bobo Ahun, demands that Sayid Abdullah adopt the constitution and divest himself of authority as an absolute monarch. While the Khan was shocked to hear about the Vizier's wild proposal, he agrees, at least somewhat, that the Khanate needs modernization to survive. The question on the Khan’s mind now is whether the Khanate needs the radical and rapid modernization of Bobo Ahun, or should our archaic state be modernized gradually by the Khan himself?"
khiva.3.a:0 "He is reasonable. The Khan should be a constitutional monarch and reform with Ahun’s aid."
khiva.3.b:0 "This is nonsense. The Khan will stay as an absolute monarch and reform gradually."

khiva.4.t:0 "Young Khiva Revolution"
khiva.4.d:0 "Outraged by the Khan's words and his unwillingness to allow for Khiva’s rapid modernization and reform, the Young Khiva Party has organized mass protests in the city of Nukus and its outlying nomad towns. The Khan has mobilized the Basmachi to disperse the crowd, but the power of revolutionaries is only growing."
khiva.4.a:0 "Send the Basmachi to crush these reformers"

khiva.5.t:0 "Armed Conflict in Nukus"
khiva.5.d:0 "There are numerous reports coming in from the south about armed conflicts between Young Khiva protesters and the Basmachi militants led by Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi. The streets of the ancient city are being bathed in blood as the opposing forces clash for the soul of Khiva. Despite the victor, it seems that the bloodshed cannot be avoided and will rage on until one side finally falters."
khiva.5.a:0 "Attempt to agree to the Young Khiva's demands."
khiva.5.b:0 "Mobilize more forces in Nukus to crush them."

khiva.6.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.6.d:0 "The Basmachi were completely destroyed in Nukus with Young Khivans raising the flag of a liberated Khiva high over the city. Their braveness has encouraged other citizens in Khivan cities across the nation to rise up as well in protest and revolt and today the personal forces and royal guard of Khan Sayid Abdullah himself were crushed as well, signalling the end of his horrid reign. The Khan has been forced to abdicate and has fled into exile while the Young Khiva Party has declared the Republic of Khiva in Nukus where the first battle was won."
khiva.6.a:0 "Long Live the Khivan Republic!"

khiva.7.t:0 "Basmachi Victory"
khiva.7.d:0 "The Young Khiva protesters were completely and utterly annihilated in Nukus with Basmachi forces ending the fighting with burning of the Young Khivan’s republican flags. Sayid Abdullah, Khan of Khiva, has arrived to personally congratulate the Basmachi on their victory and offered Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi the office of Vizier to replace the disgraced Bobo Ahun. Now nothing can stop Khiva from respecting the traditions of Kadimism."
khiva.7.a:0 "Long Live the Khanate!"

khiva.8.t:0 "First Khivan Elections"
khiva.8.d.rep:0 "With the Young Khivan’s victory in the civil war, the first elections are now to be held in the wake of the Khan’s defeat. Though not many candidates have entered the runnings in the young republic, the race is still expected to be lively The first faction poised to win is the moderate wing of Young Khiva Party, led by Bobo Ahun himself, while the second most prominent group in the running is the liberal wing of the Young Khivans, led by Palvan-Niyaz Yusupov."
khiva.8.d.mon:0 "With our annihilation of the Young Khivan radicals in Nukus, the first elections are to be held now to commemorate our victory. There are not many candidates in the running to rule under the Khan, but the competition is still fierce. The first faction is the moderate wing of Young Khiva Party, recently expunged of radical elements and led by the redeemed Bobo Ahun himself, with their main opponents being the conservative wing, led by Palvan-Niyaz Yusupov."
khiva.8.a:0 "Young Khiva Moderates!"
khiva.8.b:0 "Young Khiva Liberals!"
khiva.8.c:0 "Young Khiva Conservatives!"

khiva.9.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.9.d:0 "Young Khiva Party, led by Bobo Ahun stayed victorious in the first republican elections in Khivan history. While Khiva is finally opened to modernization, we will probably lose an ally in the Emirate of Bukhara, as our modern ideals of Jadidism do not align with their traditional views. The Young Khiva movement, with their newfound strength and influence, can also probably provoke the Young Bukhara Party to rebel against or cooperate with their recent win as well, drawing them out into the open and cutting the head off the snake before their influence grows too strong."
khiva.9.a:0 "Perhaps we should ally Young Bukhara before they rebel as well."
khiva.9.b:0 "Strengthen the power of Basmachi in the region."
khiva.9.c:0 "Congratulate the new Khivan Government."

khiva.10.t:0 "Basmachi Victory in Khiva"
khiva.10.d:0 "The Young Khiva Party, led by Bobo Ahun, was crushed in the recent elections in the regal Khanate of Khiva. The power in the Khanate’s government under the Khan has been transferred to the Basmachi, meaning we can still rely on both the royal houses and the Emirate of Bukhara to aid us in case of war with the foul liberal of Kokand. The Young Khivan’s loss can also probably provoke the Young Khivan Party to rebell as well, finally pushing them too far to open up a position to discredit them for good."
khiva.10.a:0 "Congratulate Basmachi in Khiva on their recent win."
khiva.10.b:0 "Congratulate the Basmachi and push the Young Khivans."

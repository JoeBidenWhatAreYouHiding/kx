khiva.1.t: "The Recent History of Khwarezm"
khiva.1.d: "The Khanate of Khiva had been under Russian protectorate since 1873. However, after the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the Young Khivans presented the Khiva khan Isfandiyar-khan with demands for reforms, with which he was forced to agree and promised to establish a majlis and limit his own power. However, the situation further escalated and the Young Khiva government was overthrown and the planned liberal reforms were not carried out.\n\nIn January 1918, Isfandiyar-khan appointed Junaid-khan as commander of the armed forces of the khanate, but after the Russian detachment left Khiva, by order of Junaid-khan Isfandiyar-khan was killed. Junaid-khan made Said Abdullah-khan, Isfandiyar's younger brother, the puppet monarch, and he himself became the sole ruler of Khiva.\n\nThe Mujahideen were well armed, the Khiva territories were flourishing, and Junaid-Khan kept an iron grip on his army, sending it east and north to attack the Reds, where he became famous for his victories in several hard battles.\n\nWhen the dust settled over Central Asia and the war ended, the Russians soon discovered that it was much more difficult to negotiate with Junaid-Khan than with Isfandiar. Although Russia now recognized Khiva's sovereignty, the Sazonov government still sought to keep Khiva within its sphere of influence and to maintain access to its vast natural resources. Junaid-Khan was vehemently opposed to this, as well as to many of the political reforms in the khanate previously supported by the Russian republicans. The brigand tsar was ready to send his invincible army against the weakened Russians and chase them away if they exceeded their authority."
khiva.1.a: "Interesting"

khiva.2.t: "Junaid-Khan Is Dead!"
khiva.2.d: "Junaid-Khan, proud Yomud military commander and our “dear” leader for almost 20 years has finally succumbed to the withering of age and has passed away. The Khanate mourns as they prepare for the coming power struggle."
khiva.2.a: "Eshi-Khan, son of Junaid-Khan, ascends the throne"
khiva.2.b: "A Turkmen chief, Azis-Khan, seizes power."

khiva.3.t: "The Rule of Junaid-Khan"
khiva.3.d: "Throughout the 1920s the Russians tried to persuade Junaid-Khan to demobilize his army and sign a treaty of friendship with Russia, but all these talks collapsed after Kolchak's coup. He announced the end of the old era of obedience and his intention to immediately restore the territories that Khiva had lost after it had been subdued five decades before, and the Russians were virtually powerless to stop him as his Basmachi army had annexed the entire Transcaspian region with large Turkmen population.\n\nIn time Russia was forced to accept the new terms of cooperation with Khiva, and efforts were made to normalize both political and commercial relations with the new khanate, although Junaid was still much more protective of his economy than previous rulers.\nThe decade that followed was a difficult period for Junaid-Khan, as he owned a vast country, but he had to face the difficulties of actually governing the state. He faced problems in the form of liberal movements, and Uzbeks displeased with the Turkmen ruler. Eventually Junaid decided to retain a few barbaric elements of Basmachi just to maintain stability. Loyal cronies were promoted to replace capable administrators, and the brigands were given the right to collect taxes and tribute. That made Khiva to remain an agrarian, nomadic country in the middle of the desert.\n\nAlthough Khiva's impressive agriculture kept the country afloat, the situation seemed to be on a downward spiral, as there was little to keep the people united. To solve this problem, Junaid began cultivating a sense of Turkmen nationalism influenced by the ideas of his more intellectual ally Aziz Khan, in the hope that a common collective identity would bind the Turkmen tribes together. The aging Junaid-khan also began to prepare his son Eshey-khan, a capable warrior, to inherit the throne after his imminent death. But Junaid is adamant: he must first destroy the remaining organized political opposition and stabilize the country to ensure a smooth transition of power to his son."
khiva.3.a: "Khiva Lives On!"

khiva.4.t: "Breadbasket of Turkestan"
khiva.4.d: "The oasis located on the Amu Darya together with the developed irrigation system allowed Khiva to become the breadbasket of Turkestan - to have a huge income from the export of agricultural products. Another source was minerals mined near the Aral Sea. Despite the increasing protectionism of Junaid-Khan, Khiva goods were in great demand in Russia, which brought in most of the export revenues every year.\n\nHowever. that was all. To the south lay the barren Karakum Desert, and near the border with Persia lay the abandoned Trans-Caspian Railway, which connected a port on the Caspian Sea with the rest of Turkestan. In addition to the riches that the land brings, another important source of income is the smuggling of weapons and the robbery of caravans, which have recently been very reluctant to visit Khwarezm."
khiva.4.a: "Some modernization is needed."

khiva.5.t: "Agricultural Exports Put On Hold!"
khiva.5.d: "As the economic crisis broke out in Europe and everywhere else in the world, it also affected our most important importers - Russia and Kokand. As a result of this hell of a modernized world, our largest importers have stopped all purchases, and this before the most important stage of the new sowing. \n\nWithout a resumption of supplies, our economy risks collapse!"
khiva.5.a: "Damn the modern world!"

khiva.6.t: "Kokand Plunges Into Civil War!"
khiva.6.d: "With the Turkestan falling into a bloody civil war, we are now free for a new conquest campaign. This time Junaid-Khan hopes to successfully invade the right bank of Amu-Darya, including the cities of Nukus and Turtkul."
khiva.6.a: "Seize the Amu-Darya right bank!"

khiva.7.t: "[FROM.GetName] Seized Nukus!"
khiva.7.d: "Using our weak position, the horde of Junaid-Khan, a Khivan Dictator, have roamed the right bank of the Amu-Darya and seized major cities of Nukus and Turtkul!"
khiva.7.a: "We can't do anything now!"

khiva.8.t: "Coup in Khiva"
khiva.8.d: "Junaid-Khan himself went on another raid against his neighbors and for the sake of raising prestige and legitimacy, along with his son and closest advisor, Eshi-Khan. \n\nHowever, his opponents took advantage of this, having long ago established a coalition of various forces against the usurper, on the other bank of the Amu-Darya. In the absence of Junaid-Khan and his associates in the capital of Khorezm, the opposition moved to the other side of the Amu-Darya from Turtkul and seized power in the city, announcing the establishment of the Provisional Council of the Khiva Khanate. \n\nThe council included both former cronies of the murdered Isfandiyar Khan and the Young Khivans. The power of this council is not yet strong, but it seems that the Dictator of Khwarezm must urgently return to the capital and suppress this palace coup."
khiva.8.a: "Junaid-Khan turns his troops back on the capital..."

khiva.9.t: "March on Khiva"
khiva.9.d: "Gathering additional Mojahedin units along the way, Junaid-Khan announced a march on Khiva. He urged the citizens to rally around him as a true representative of all the peoples of the Khanate, not just a small group of Uzbeks at the mouth of the Amu Darya.\n\nHowever, in Khiva itself, with its predominantly Uzbek population, Junaid-khan met fierce resistance. Many of the palace and city guards defected to the conspirators, as did the population, who were clearly in favor of the Young Khiva's reforms.\n\nThe situation was uncertain and with roughly equal numbers of opposing forces, the outcome of the battle for Khiva remains unknown..."
khiva.9.a: "The loyalists storm the palace and arrest the conspirators..."
khiva.9.b: "Junaid-Khan forces swept away, the conspirators gain a foothold in Khwarezm..."

khiva.10.t: "The Last Nail in the Coffin of Dictatorship"
khiva.10.d: "The Provisional Council was able to repel the Mujahideen attack on the capital of the Khanate. Junaid Khan's troops were pushed beyond the original Khiva and dispersed across the Karakum desert. Rumors reached us that Junaid-Khan himself was settling in Ashgabat, gathering another army to fight us.\n\nBut even now, with our small forces, we have been able to rally the people and establish control over the northern part of the Khanate. \n\nThe Provisional Council announced reforms, the adoption of a constitution and limiting the role of the monarch."
khiva.10.a: "We must now secure control of Karakum"

khiva.11.t: "Khiva Massacre"
khiva.11.d: "The last few days will go down in history as terrible days for the Khanate of Khiva. More terrible than the Soviet attack and the coup of 1918. \n\nThe streets of the ancient city were sprinkled with the blood of the rebels and protesters, as well as all those who in any way tried to hold the defense in the city. Many were killed, but the disgraceful leadership of the opposition, the vile conspirators, were able to move back to the lands of Kokand. \n\nThe Dictator of Khwarezm has regained power and order will now be restored with an even harsher hand."
khiva.11.a: "The reign of Junaid-Khan is preserved."

khiva.12.t: "Junaid-Khan Sends Support"
khiva.12.d: "Junaid-Khan, Vizier of Khiva, Dictator of Khwarezm, has sent us two divisions of Mujahideen, ready to fight for their faith. This will greatly help us in our efforts against [DEH.GetName]"
khiva.12.a: "We are very grateful."

khiva.13.t: "Successful Delivery"
khiva.13.d: "The weapons have smoothly passed the borders and are now stored in the port of Krasnovodsk. We should now decide what to do with the weapons."
khiva.13.a: "Nice."

khiva.14.t: "The Delivery Failed"
khiva.14.d: "As a result of circumstances beyond our control, a valuable cargo with the latest weapons has been lost, and we have no choice but to mourn for the gold spent."
khiva.14.a: "Damn."

khiva.15.t: "Illegal Gun-Runners Exposed"
khiva.15.d: "We managed to catch the smugglers ashore the Caspian Sea with tons of our weaponry ready to sail abroad. From the interrogation, we found out who the customer was, and it turned out to be the Khivan Khan's vizier, Junaid-Khan, the Dictator of Khwarezm. With the gun-runners exposed, our government has put them on trial, also launching a large-scale investigation into leaks in weapons depots, and has also expressed a diplomatic protest to Khiva, restricting all trade with them."
khiva.15.a: "No smuggling in Russia will be tolerated."

khiva.16.t: "Russian Government Outraged"
khiva.16.d: "The Russian government managed to expose our contact, confiscating tons of weaponry, ready to sail to us. They quickly found out who the customer was, and now their government has seized all the contacts with us, also enacting embargo."
khiva.16.a: "One less market, it seems."

khiva.17.t: "Turkmens Hinder Deliveries"
khiva.17.d: "The southern tribes have intercepted arms shipments, effectively blocking the flow from [PER.GetName]. It seems that until we deal with them, we cannot effectively smuggle [PER.GetAdjective] arms."
khiva.17.a: "Bastards."

khiva.18.t: "Weapons from Khiva"
khiva.18.d: "We were informed that certain organisations in our country smuggle weapons from Khiva, produced by other countries. While this is illegal, we can use this situation for our own good, demanding our share and supplying our army."
khiva.18.a: "That's a great idea."
khiva.18.b: "No, that will bolster corruption."

khiva.19.t: "Successful Delivery!"
khiva.19.d: "We managed to successfully smuggle the weapons to [FROM.GetName] at inflated prices, receiving good amount of gold into our treasury. Now we have to decide what to do with it."
khiva.19.a: "Great!"

khiva.20.t: "The Delivery Failed"
khiva.20.d: "As a result of circumstances beyond our control, a valuable cargo with the latest weapons has been lost, and we have no choice but to mourn for the weapons we could use for ourselves."
khiva.20.a: "Damn."

khiva.21.t: "Firm Hand of Junaid-Khan"
khiva.21.d: "The 1936 has just began only to inform the closest confederates of Junaid-Khan about his illness. The 79-year old Yomud, Dictator of Khwarezm, who has been in power for 18 years, has not only become too paranoid and physically ill, but, perhaps... mentally ill, as well.\n\nThe Jadidist movement of Young Khivans, who has for long been a cause for all Khan's crackdowns on freedom, has gained some strength over the years, especially after the neighboring Kokand Republic gained some stability and strength.\n\nMoreover, some of the Turkmen tribes in the south became too unruly, blocking the trade ways from Persia and Afghanistan, raiding on the caravans and preventing gold, goods and weapons from reaching the Junaid-Khan's treasury. It's time to deal with all these problems, while the dictator is still alive."
khiva.21.a: "The rule of Junaid-Khan is under threat."

khiva.22.t: "Pacifying the Southern Tribes"
khiva.22.d: "The Southern Turkmen tribes have been rebelling against our rule since 1935, when Junaid-Khan has demanded more tribute from them, due to the economic isolation of the Khanate. When they refused, he ordered to incinerate fertile fields and burn villages to the ground. This criminal order was successfully carried out by his henchmen, depriving the khanate of some of the harvest, and some Turkmen tribes of families, shelter and food.\n\nThe Turkmen tribes should be pacified now, and the old Dictator suggested that he should visit their elders himself and make them respect him. While some of his henchmen believe this to be generally a bad idea, no one dares to dissuade Junaid-Khan, fearing for his head."
khiva.22.a: "The Dictator shall visit them himself."
khiva.22.b: "Not this time. Just burn their villages again."
khiva.22.c: "Appease them with Junaid-Khan's gold."

khiva.23.t: "Junaid-Khan Murdered!"
khiva.23.d: ""

khiva.24.t: "Southern Tribes Brutally Pacified"
khiva.24.d: ""
khiva.24.a: "Let them know their place."

khiva.25.t: "Souther Tribes Pacified"
khiva.25.d: ""
khiva.25.a: "Let us enjoy the fruits of loyalty."

khiva.28.t: "Raid Successful"
khiva.28.d: "We managed to seize some supplies from our neighbors, with loyal Mujahideen already marching to visit Junaid-Khan and show what they got."
khiva.28.a: "Nice."

khiva.29.t: "Raid Failed"
khiva.29.d: "We were unable to seize anything from our neighbours. Their forces managed to secure their citizens and lands from our raiders."
khiva.29.a: "Too bad."

khiva.30.t: "Loot Seized by Raiders"
khiva.30.d: "The raiders successfully seized some supplies from our neighbors, but they refused to give it to the Khan, seizing them for themselves!"
khiva.30.a: "Neither bad nor good, to be honest."

khiva.31.t: "We Were Raided!"
khiva.31.d: "Some raiders from the Khanate of Khiva have rushed into our lands, seizing all they can from our people. Fortunately, we managed to strike back and force them to retreat back to where they came from. We should write a letter to [UZB.GetLeader] and demand he better look after banditry in his lands."
khiva.31.a: "Glad we got rid of them."

khiva.32.t: "We Were Raided!"
khiva.32.d: "Some raiders from the Khanate of Khiva have rushed into our lands, seizing all they can from our people. Unfortunately, we could not stop them. We should write a letter to [UZB.GetLeader] and demand he better look after banditry in his lands."
khiva.32.a: "We should be prepared next time"

khiva.33.t: "The Eternal City"
khiva.33.d: "In a resplendent display of cultural revival, the city of Khiva celebrates its 2440th anniversary with a renewed commitment to its rich historical traditions. The streets are adorned with majestic decorations, evoking the grandeur of the past. The event is marked by traditional ceremonies, showcasing the deep reverence for Khiva's ancestral customs and the restoration of its ancient splendor. From the regal procession to the captivating performances, every aspect of the celebration pays homage to the enduring legacy of the city's illustrious history."
khiva.33.d2: "As Khiva commemorates its 2440th anniversary, the city bursts with a palpable sense of progress and transformation. The celebration takes on a modern twist, reflecting the spirit of innovation and forward-thinking. Alongside the traditional festivities, there are exhibitions showcasing technological advancements, interactive displays highlighting modern achievements, and panel discussions on fostering economic growth and social development. The event serves as a catalyst for embracing a new era, embracing change while honoring the city's rich heritage."
khiva.33.d3: "Under the banner of absolute authority, Khiva's 2440th anniversary celebration takes on a grandiose tone. The event becomes a magnificent display of power, with the ruler and his loyal entourage presiding over the festivities. Military parades, ostentatious displays of wealth, and lavish ceremonies showcase the might and dominance of the absolute ruler. The celebration is a testament to the ruler's vision of restoring Khiva's former glory and cementing their unquestionable authority."
khiva.33.d4: "As Khiva commemorates its 2440th anniversary, the city becomes a symbol of resilience and democratic aspirations. The celebration becomes a platform for open dialogue, where intellectuals, activists, and community leaders gather to discuss the future of the city. Public speeches, peaceful demonstrations, and artistic expressions highlight the quest for democratic reform, advocating for the rights of the people and the establishment of inclusive governance. The event becomes a beacon of freedom, marking a pivotal moment in Khiva's journey towards democratic transformation."
khiva.33.d5: "In a paradoxical display of control and suppression, Khiva's 2440th anniversary celebration takes on an eerie atmosphere. The streets are lined with security forces, their presence casting a shadow over the festivities. The event becomes a carefully orchestrated spectacle, where performances and cultural displays are tightly controlled, mirroring the iron grip of the ruling regime. Amidst the forced cheerfulness, a sense of unease lingers, reminding the people of the price they pay for dissent."
khiva.33.d6: "With a unique focus on Khiva's nomadic roots, the city's 2440th anniversary celebration takes a captivating turn. The event showcases the nomadic lifestyle that once defined the region, with traditional yurts, camel caravans, and nomadic rituals creating an immersive experience. Visitors can partake in traditional nomadic games, taste authentic nomadic cuisine, and engage in activities that celebrate the nomadic spirit. The celebration becomes a testament to Khiva's nomadic heritage, reinforcing the bond between its people and their ancestral identity."
khiva.33.a: "A vibrant tapestry of tradition and unity!"

khiva.34.t: "Junaid-Khan's Health Deteriorates"
khiva.34.d: ""
khiva.34.a: "Age has its limits."

khiva.35.t: "The New Vizier of Khiva"
khiva.35.d: "With the opposition gaining a foothold in the Khivan oasis and keeping large amount of resources under their control, it is time to settle the most vital issues.\n\nThe most important one - is the question of power. The opposition, consisting of both Young Khivans and former loyalists of murdered Isfandiyar-khan are experiencing great difficulties in cooperating. Ishahoja Hojaev, appointed as the Vizier of the Supervisory Council, or Nozirlar Kengashi, is a staunch Kadimist and reactionary. He's not really a supporter of constitutional monarchy, Young Khivans have been promoted all these years. But he actually has no choice at all. With Sayid Abdullah-khan being a titular monarch all these years, in fact, under house arrest, he's known to be a weak and naive person. Whether these differences between coalition partners will be eventually resolved is an open question, though."
khiva.35.a: "Let us hope Khiva will remain stable."

khiva.36.t: "Usul-i-Jadid"
khiva.36.d: "The Junaid-Khan regime practically did not deal with the modernization of education or education in general. Young Khivans advocated the introduction of a new method in mektebs and madrasahs - the sound method of literacy teaching to replace the alphabetic one. The obsolete religious schools of Khorezm had to be replaced by national secular schools and science and culture had to be developed.\n\nThe plans of the Young Khiva include the establishment of a solid academic year with examinations and a transition to a class-lesson system of teaching. In addition, the new-method schools should introduce standard European ways of teaching: desks, gradebooks, benches, blackboards, division of students into classes, and class time into lessons. Other secular disciplines should also be greatly expanded. Schools should teach history (tarihi), geography, and arithmetic in addition to religion.\n\nAll this has long existed in the schools of Russia and Turkestan, and Khorezm has lagged far behind not only the modernized Western powers, but even its neighbors. The Vizier is expected to pass this bill, otherwise Khiva will remain backward."
khiva.36.a: "Our people in a desperate need of modern education."

khiva.37.t: "Writing the Constitution"
khiva.37.d: "The Nozirlar Kengashi finally sat down to write Khorezm's supreme legal document - the first time in its centuries-long history a constitution was planned - and to limit the monarch's power on paper. And for centuries to come. Fortunately, Sayid Abdullah Khan is a weak and unambitious man, who will not be able to prevent it in any way, like the Emir of Bukhara. \n\nThe main difficulty at this stage will be to negotiate the constitution with the more conservative coalition partners and the Vizier, who may react negatively to the radical modernist reforms of Young Khiva."
khiva.37.a: "Let the Council see sense."

khiva.38.t: "Council Splits on Property Question"
khiva.38.d: "On the issue of property, the Council could not reach a consensus. The most radical Jadidists, as well as members of the Communist Party of Khorezm, considered it necessary and important to nationalize the property and all resources of the Khanate, as well as to expropriate Khan's property.\n\nDespite years of stealing from the inhabitants of Khorezm and the enormous accumulation of treasury wealth, some of which Junaid-Khan was able to export, the conservative Nazirs opposed such radical measures."
khiva.38.a: "We will decide this question by a separate decree later."

khiva.39.t: "Limitation of Khan"
khiva.39.d: "One of the main articles of the constitution should be the legal establishment of a limited monarchy. On this question, a sudden discussion first broke out, and the radical Young Khivans and Communists proposed to abolish the monarchy in general and establish a republican system. However, all in all, citing the incompetence of Said Abdullah Khan, the Council was able to agree on the most important reform - the adoption of a constitutional monarchy."
khiva.39.a: "Agreed."

khiva.40.t: "The Parliament"
khiva.40.d: "Another important issue in the discussion of the constitution was the institution of Parliament. In accordance with the 1917 draft reforms, the Young Khiva proposed the creation of a bicameral parliament, the Majlis. The upper chamber should be the Nozirlar Kengashi itself, and the government should be formed after the elections. \n\nHowever, this was sharply opposed by conservative lawmakers, who argued that it would be much more effective to create a unicameral parliament and strengthen the power of the government. Such a project would prevent effective representation of all ethnic groups living in Khorezm, including the majority Turkmen and a minority of Uzbeks and Karakalpaks."
khiva.40.a: "A bicamerial structure is appreciated."
khiva.40.b: "One-chambered parliament with strong government."

khiva.41.t: "Administrative Division"
khiva.41.d: "The issue of administrative division was also hotly debated. The proposal of the leftist ministers was to introduce special autonomous Vyaylets for the Turkmen and Karakalpaks, but the conservatives opposed any singling out of special autonomies, arguing that this would destroy the great Khorezm state, which should be centralized and united. "
khiva.41.a: "Divide the Khanate into equal Vilayats"
khiva.41.b: "Special autonomies for Karakalpak and Turkmen people."

khiva.42.t: "The First Khivan Constitution"
khiva.42.d: "Finally, the Constitution of Khorezm was officially adopted today. The first of its kind. This is a great breakthrough for our state. Tomorrow morning the text of the new Constitution will be in all the newspapers of the country, and now it is time to hold the first elections to the Majlis and form a legitimate government. Of course, if the Vizier doesn't interfere in any way..."
khiva.42.a: "A great success for our country!"

khiva.43.t: "The New-Method Schools Rejected by Vizier"
khiva.43.d: "Unfortunately, the project proposed by the Young Khivans to introduce new-methodical schools in Khorezm failed... The Vizier, Ishahoja Hojaev, suppressed the bill by refusing to sign it. It seems that the confrontation between Jadidists and Kadimists will only intensify after this unlawful ban. \n\nAlready now Young Khiva understands that the Vizier is becoming an insurmountable obstacle on the way to democratization and modenization of Khorezm, while the Vizier himself is already openly criticizing the reformers."
khiva.43.a: "Another obstacle on our path to modernization!"

khiva.44.t: "An Important Bill Rejected by the Council"
khiva.44.d: "Today, a bill proposed by the radical part of Young Khiva, together with the Communists, to control the state treasury was rejected in the Council. Conservatives criticized the draft for its radical nature and declared that the state treasury should not be subjected to any changes, and in general it was better not to be touched by anyone except the Treasurer, Khan, and Vizier."
khiva.44.a: "Nazirs become a real hindrance to us!"

khiva.45.t: "Tensions Grow in Nozirlar Kengashi"
khiva.45.d: "A number of radical bills have recently been rejected by conservative ministers or rejected by the Vizier, and with this there is growing overt tension between conservatives and reformers.\n\nThe Young Khivans are becoming really disenchanted with the ideas of constitutional monarchy and are very concerned about the Kadimist sentiments in society. The failure to hold elections, which have long been on the horizon, also adds to the tension."
khiva.45.a: "At least the country is stabilizing"

khiva.46.t: "Flaws in the Constitutional System"
khiva.46.d: "The system adopted by the Nozirlar Kengashi proved to be completely unsuitable. In particular, the reformers did not foresee that the appointment of elections takes place with the approval of the Vizier, who had already been postponing them for several months. Moreover, the Vizier has no right to cancel them, but can only postpone them. This parade of postponements has been going on for quite some time.\n\nIn this connection, at a joint meeting of the parties of Young Khiva and Communists, the procedure for the next postponement of the elections was agreed upon. The radicals proposed a radical option - the overthrow of the monarchy and the Vizier and the long-awaited liberation of Khorezm from authoritarianism and nepotism. On the other hand, the more moderate Young Khiva believe that the monarchy itself does not pose any threat, and the problem is only in the conservatives, who actually hold power by force, because their public support is obviously much less than that of the Young Khiva."
khiva.46.a: "Elections are once again postponed"

khiva.47.t: "Political Crisis Gains Momentum"
khiva.47.d: "The protracted political crisis brewing on the sidelines of the Majlis seems about to peak. Recently, the revolution's only success has been the adoption of a constitution - and it has not been fully respected. The tension between reformers and conservatives is already so great that the Young Khiva ignores the Council's meetings in their entirety, depriving it of a quorum. \n\nBekjon Rakhmon, one of the leftist leaders of Young Khiva, for the first time made an open demand to the Nozirlar Kengashi - to resign all the reactionaries preventing modernization, including the Vizier."
khiva.47.a: "The reactionaries should resign!"

khiva.48.t: "Young Khivans Disappointment Grows"
khiva.48.d: "With the conservatives unwilling to contribute in any way to modernization, the Communists and Young Khiva gathered for an emergency council to organize a revolution. There was no turning back, and the realization of the need for a Second Revolution had already reached all members of both parties.\n\nHowever, the Council has not yet agreed on how power will be arranged after the successful overthrow of the conservatives. The Communists undoubtedly insist on the overthrow of the monarchy as a whole and a transition to a socialist democratic system, but such an approach is not echoed by some Young Khivaites, including their spiritual and political leader Boboohun Salimov. In the event that the Revolution decides to leave the monarch in power, it is quite possible that the Communists will abandon us. However, we may not fear them, as their popularity is extremely low."
khiva.48.a: "Monarchy is ultimately an archaic obstruction!"
khiva.48.b: "It is Hojaev who prevents the reforms!"

khiva.49.t: "Boboohun Tries to Negotiate with Vizier"
khiva.49.d: "With the political crisis looming, Boboohun Salimov, leader of the Young Khiva Party, has attempted to negotiate with the conservative members of the Nozirlar Kengashi, especially the Vizier, in order to settle the issues and problems between the liberals and reactionary ministers.\n\nFormer Qazi, the Judge, despite his liberal stance, is a person of great respect even among the most reactionary ministers. The Vizier listened to him and hopefully, he understood all the importance of the modernization. However, his final decision is yet to be announced."
khiva.49.a: "Ishahoja Hojaev refused to step down"
khiva.49.b: "For the sake of nation, Hojaev steps down..."

khiva.50.t: "Bobo Ahun Demands Khan's Abdication"
khiva.50.d: "The leader of the Young Khivans, Bobo Ahun, demands that Sayid Abdullah should abdicate from his throne. While the Khan was shocked to hear about the Boboohun's wild proposal, he agrees, at least somewhat, that the Khanate needs modernization to survive."
khiva.50.a: "He is reasonable. The Khan should abdicate."
khiva.50.b: "This is nonsense. The Khan will stay as a constitutional monarch and reform gradually."

khiva.51.t: "Young Khiva Revolution"
khiva.51.d: "Outraged by the Hojaev's words and his unwillingness to allow for Khiva’s rapid modernization and reform, the Young Khiva Party has organized mass protests in the city of Khiva and its outlying nomad towns. The Vizier has mobilized the Mujahideen to disperse the crowd, but the power of revolutionaries is only growing."
khiva.51.a: "Send the Mujahideen to crush these reformers"

khiva.52.t: "Armed Conflict in Khiva"
khiva.52.d: "There are numerous reports coming in from the south about armed conflicts between Young Khiva protesters and the reactionary militants led by Ishahoja Hojaev. The streets of the ancient city are being bathed in blood as the opposing forces clash for the soul of Khiva. Despite the victor, it seems that the bloodshed cannot be avoided and will rage on until one side finally falters."
khiva.52.a: "Attempt to agree to the Young Khiva's demands."
khiva.52.b: "Mobilize more forces in Khiva to crush them."

khiva.53.t: "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.53.d: "The Mujahideen were completely destroyed in Khiva with Young Khivans raising the flag of a liberated Khiva high over the city. Their braveness has encouraged other citizens in Khivan cities across the nation to rise up as well in protest and revolt and today the personal forces and royal guard of Khan Sayid Abdullah himself were crushed as well, signalling the end of his horrid reign. The Khan has been forced to abdicate and has fled into exile while the Young Khiva Party has declared the Republic of Khiva in Khiva where the first battle was won."
khiva.53.a: "Long Live the Khorezm Republic!"

khiva.54.t: "Viziers's Victory"
khiva.54.d: "The Young Khiva protesters were completely and utterly annihilated in Khiva with Mujahideen forces ending the fighting with burning of the Young Khivan’s republican flags. Sayid Abdullah, Khan of Khiva, has arrived to personally congratulate the Mujahideen on their victory. Now nothing can stop Khiva from respecting the traditions of Kadimism."
khiva.54.a: "Long Live the Khanate!"

khiva.55.t: "First Khorezm Elections"
khiva.55.d: "With the reactionaries finally gone, the country was free to held the first ever democratic elections. With only two parties participating, it is expected for much more popular Young Khiva to win a significant majority of mandates."
khiva.55.a: "Khorezm Communists surprisingly manage to win."
khiva.55.b: "Young Khivans’ convincing victory"

khiva.56.t: "Uncontrolled Food Prices"
khiva.56.d: "After agricultural exports were halted, the price of these goods rose substantially as producers were left without income. At the same time, prices proved to be too high and rose almost exponentially. On the other hand, no one can afford to buy these goods, much less our foreign importers.\n\nThe situation is clearly out of control, and urgent measures must be taken - namely, the establishment of a monopoly on prices by the state. Although this is a temporary and rather radical measure, it could allow us to stop the rise in prices."
khiva.56.a: "A dangerous situation"

khiva.57.t: "Khivan Economy Collapses!"
khiva.57.d: "The sharp increase in the price of agricultural products only spurred inflation. The Khorezm Tenga has lost almost all of its value, and many locals have already switched to barter. In fact, we can talk about the collapse of the economy, the difficulties of sowing and exporting agricultural products aggravated the situation, and in fact all production and manufactory stopped. It is not known whether we will ever be able to get out of this situation..."
khiva.57.a: "Devastating!"

khiva.58.t: "Agricultural Prices Monopoly"
khiva.58.d: "By decree of Junaid-Khan, a monopoly was imposed on the prices of agricultural products throughout the Khanate. Now, the rise in prices was stopped and fixed at a level just above the pre-crisis level, but this could not stop the striking decline in the quality of life, and the growth of all-pervasive poverty.\n\nJunaid-Khan now faces a long-term plan to diversify the local economy with the hope of increasing production, but we should not expect significant growth in industry in the near future."
khiva.58.a: "Will Khiva recover from this?"

khiva.59.t: "Shortage of Food!"
khiva.59.d: "With the agricultural exports from Khiva completely stopped, we now face a shortage of food, which can eventually cause even famine! It is unlikely that [UZB.GetName] will go on with agricultural exports anytime soon. We must find new markets to buy food for our citizens, until it is too late."
khiva.59.a: "We should find other markets for now."

khiva.60.t: "Atabayev Consolidates His Power"
khiva.60.d: "Gaygysyz Atabayev has finally being appointed as the Premier of [ROOT.GetName]. With the loyal ministers appointed as well, it is time for the reforms, and, perhaps, some of them can be seen even as radical for the Khorezm.\n\nBeing an ethnic Turkmen, from Yomud Tribe, Atabayev now is looking forward to transforming the Khorezm People's Republic into a more national-oriented socialist republic of Turkmens, where the Uzbeks and Karakalpaks are only minorities. However, he still thinks that in these circumstances it can be better for people to refer themselves to as Khorezmians - not by ethnicity nor nationality, but by their geographic place of living."
khiva.60.a: "We should highlight unity of Uzbeks and Turkmens."
khiva.60.b: "Uzbeks are a minority in our new, Turkmen, state!"

khiva.61.t: "Left Young Khivans Split!"
khiva.61.d: "With the tensions in Young Khiva Party rising over the last few months, the leader of the left-wing, Polvonniyoz Khodzhi Yusupov, has announced the establishment of a new party - Khorezm Socialist Party. Decades ago, during the Soviet Intervention, he had already left the Young Khivans and was one of the founding members of the Khorezm Communist Party, that seized to exist as soon as Bolsheviks were driven out of Turkestan. Now, the legacy of the Communist party, seems to live on with Polvonniyoz announcing XSP. This time their policies were based more on SR program, that is by a large extent a peasant-oriented problem, than the Bolsheviks had."
khiva.61.a: "We welcome Khivan socialists!"

khiva.62.t: "Abolition of Young Khiva"
khiva.62.d: "Since the establishment of the XSP and larging tendencies of authoritarianism during Atabayev's rule, the Young Khiva party eventually disbanded itself, with their former members either joining XSP or YHP. Now, there are only two parties left in the region, with XSP far more popular in the Uzbek-majority regions, while YHP gets landslide victories in the majority of districts, where the Turkmens live."
khiva.62.a: "Glad they realized all advantages of socialism!"

khiva.63.t: "Turkmen Identity Effort"
khiva.63.d: "The Turkmens are in majority Nomadic tribes, that wandered the Karakum desert for several centuries without ever settling down. With the modernization and urbanization coming to Transcaspian Region with the Russian colonization, the Turkmens were oppressed - firstly under the Khivan Khans of Uzbek origin and later by Russian colonizers. Now, the Turkmens are finally free. With the decision to transform Khorezm into a Turkmen state, Atabayev now faces several issues considering the Turkmen identity.\n\nFirst of all, he can base the Turkmen identity on heroic deeds of the past, like Seljuk and Khwarazmian Empires. But this will probably make our regime more nationalist. On the other hand, we can connect identity to our traditions of nomadic life and collectivism. Finally, we can focus on being always oppressed by large Empires, like Khivan and Russian ones and base our indentity on being anti-colonialist and anti-Imperialist."
khiva.63.a: "Base identity on heroic past of Seljuks and Khwarezmians"
khiva.63.b: "Socialism is inherent to Turkmens due to their history of tribalism and communalism"
khiva.63.c: "Turkmen is an anticolonialist. A true hero and protector of his land."

khiva.64.t: "The First Congress of Halk Maslahaty"
khiva.64.d: "With the YHP's successful policies in Turkmenistan, more and more dehkans and Turkmens are becoming aware of their identity and start to act as citizens. With this in mind, Atabayev issued establishment of numerous local councils all around the country with locals being elected. A true local self-government is being developed, but YHP decided to take the next step. With special decree of the government, the Majlis is to be transformed into Halk Maslahaty (People's Council). It should be now formed through a multi-level council system, similar to those of Russian narodniks.\n\nWith elections to the new Parliament held soon after the change, the new composition of the Halk Maslahaty has gathered in order to held a Congress. The absolute majority of the mandates were given to the deputies from YHP with a small number of non-partisans and candidates from XSP and former Young Khivans\n\nThe Congress re-appointed Atabayev as the Premier of Turkmenistan and adopted a new program of national development.\nThis opens a bright new page of Turkmen history."
khiva.64.a: "A smooth transition to the socialist system!"

khiva.65.t: "Rise of Turkmen Nationalism"
khiva.65.d: "With our new identity efforts, the Turkmen nationalism has been recently on rise. With various Chiefs and local leaders now actively forcing the nationalist stance among the members of their tribes. This can be a dangerous situation and we should somehow try to curtail nationalist ambitions of our people, stating than the expansionist wars are in the past and now we should develop ourselves economically in the first place."
khiva.65.a: "We're a modern, socialist state!"
khiva.65.b: "We can use them in order to bolster Turkmen patriotism"

khiva.70.t: "Fate of Sayid Abdullah-khan"
khiva.70.d: "With the Palace Coup and recent unrest, [ROOT.GetLeader] has made up his mind about the fate of Khivan monarchy. On one hand, the Titular Khan, as the descendant of Gengis Khan gave enough stability and legitimacy to the Junaid-Khan's regime. But since the latest events, his value as a figurehead has drastically changed. Sayid Abdullah-khan is now nothing more than a weak and probably sick man, under house arrest in the palace, taking up some place. His life is rather pointless now.\n\nThere are several choices what we can do with the Khan now. The first is to exile him and proclaim a republic. Moreover, build a new republic with strong Turkmen national identity. But this plan has some disadvantages, as the foreign countries can use Sayid Abdullah-khan same as we did. The second plan is rather brutal - to end the pathetic life of his, depriving others of the opportunity to use Khan as an excuse for their aggression. By doing so, we will consolidate our power and can either establish a Turkmen republic, or proclaim a new Dynasty of Junaid-Khan and his descendants."
khiva.70.a: "Send this poor man into exile."
khiva.70.b: "Sayid Abdullah-khan will face the same fate as his brother. Republic is proclaimed."
khiva.70.c: "Establish a new royal dynasty."

khiva.71.d: "Early in the morning the borders of our state were approached by several people. When the guards asked them who they are and what they seek in [ROOT.GetName], they were quite wondered to hear the answer. According to the words of the man and his company, he was the Khan of Khiva! But it was rather hard to believe in it, since the man was in pretty common clothes and the Khivan Khan was heard to never appear in public for the last 5 years. It would have been totally a nonsensical story, if not the news from Khwarezm earlier this week. According to them, Junaid-Khan, the Vizier and Dictator, has abandoned monarchy and proclaimed himself the only head of state.\n\nThe border guards telegraphed to the [ROOT.Capital.GetName] in order to know what to do with a man, who claimed to be the Khan of Khiva. After some hours, he was taken to the capital, where he was recognized as a legitimate Khivan Khan. Only after that this information was reported to [ROOT.GetLeader] who had to decide what to do with the exiled monarch. On one hand, this can be a trap. But on the other hand, we can finally get a legitimate wargoal and destroy the Turkmen Usurper in Khiva."

With unwavering determination and the support of his loyal followers, Junaid-Khan has risen from a military leader to the rightful Khan of Khwarezm. The legacy of the old Khanate is now firmly in the hands of Junaid-Khan and his faction, who see themselves as the rightful heirs to the empires of the old, namely the Khwarezmian and Seljuk empires. They believe that it is their duty to restore the glory and grandeur of these ancient realms and usher in a new era of power and prestige for Khiva.\n\nUnder Junaid-Khan's rule, the nation stands at the precipice of a new dawn. With a vision of prosperity and unity, he pledges to lead Khwarezm to unprecedented heights. The people of Khiva, weary of past hardships and longing for stability, look to their new, but also very familiar Khan with some degree of hope and anticipation. They yearn for a time when their land shall prosper, their traditions shall be revered, and their voice shall be heard on the global stage.\n\nAs the new Khan, Junaid-Khan assumes the responsibility of guiding Khwarezm towards a future defined by strength, prosperity, and cultural resurgence. The journey ahead may be fraught with challenges, but with Junaid-Khan's strategic acumen, leadership prowess, and unwavering commitment to the Khwarezmian legacy, the nation stands poised to reclaim its rightful place among the great powers of the world. Together, under the banner of the new dynasty, Khwarezm shall rise once more, revitalizing the spirit of the ancient empires and forging a path of progress, unity, and unparalleled greatness. The dawn of a new era is upon us, and the people of Khiva stand united in their belief that, with Junaid-Khan at the helm, Khwarezm shall prosper like never before."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JUNAID_KHAN_DESC: "Junaid-Khan, leader of the Yomud tribe and dictator of Khwarezm, rose to prominence as a defender of his villagers' honor and rights. Born in 1862 as Gurbanmammet Serdar, he gathered armed supporters, earned the title of Sardar, and united Turkmen tribes against Russian and Khivan oppression. Backed by foreign powers, Junaid-khan became a renowned warlord with a force of 15,000 men. In 1917, after the overthrow of the Young Khiva government, he returned to Khiva and consolidated his power. Junaid-khan's son orchestrated the murder of Isfandiyar-khan, leading Junaid-Khan to effectively rule as the sole leader of the Khanate. Despite challenges, Junaid-Khan governed the state, facing opposition from liberal movements and discontented Uzbeks. In his final years, he prepared his capable son Yeshi Khan to succeed him as the ruler of Khwarezm."
POLITICS_BOBOOKHUN_DESC: "Boboohun was born in 1874 in the family of Salimohun in the village of Gurlen. At birth, he was named Muhammad, but later, out of respect, he was nicknamed Boboohun. After receiving his primary education, he continued his education at the madrasa of Allakuli Khan in Khiva. He studied Arabic, Persian and Russian.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1918, during the reign of Khan Isfandiyar Khan of Khiva, Boboohun Salimov held the post of kazi-kalyan (supreme judge) and Sheikh-ul-Islam of the country. \n\nIn 1917, he became chairman of the Khiva Mejlis, but soon his reformist government was overthrown and he was forced to hide in Turtkul, on the territory of Kokand. He became a member of the Young Khiva party, and soon the leader of this movement. Being a supporter of the democratic development of Khorezm, Boboohun became the main symbol of the struggle of the peoples of Khiva for freedom and the main opponent of the dictatorial regime of Junaid Khan"
POLITICS_SAYID_ABDULLAH_KHAN_DESC: "Sayid Abdullah-khan is the Khan of Khiva of the Qungrat dynasty, from 1 October 1918. After the previous Khan, Isfandiyar-khan, brother of Sayid Abdullah-khan, was murdered during Junaid-Khan's coup, he was enthroned in his place. However, he had no real power and served as a source of legitimacy for the Junaid-Khan's rule. For many years he was almost under house arrest in the palace of Nurullaboy, forced to participate in public events. He's known to for his naivety and overall weakness. Sayid never was taught how to be a real monarch and should the opposition seize power, he can at most become another Titular Khan in the hands of more ambitious and powerful people."

UZB_moribund_governance: "Moribund Governance"
UZB_moribund_governance_desc: "After the February Revolution, Isfandiyar Khan, under pressure from the Young Khivans, was forced to carry out major reforms, establishing, among others, the Khiva legislative assembly, the ministry of finance, and large-scale infrastructure projects. After Junaid-khan overthrew and assassinated Isfandiyar, these projects were suspended and then cancelled as Junaid sought to eliminate any influence of the Young Khiva in his government. While this was a good way to strengthen Junaid's personal influence, it left our government unstaffed and ineffective, unable to solve many of the same problems that people had two decades earlier."
UZB_khan_army: "Junaid-Khan's Host"
UZB_khan_army_desc: "For centuries the army of the khanate was divided into a peasant militia, a standing royal army serving as palace guards, and a large network of rural tribes who swore allegiance to the khan as vassals. Junaid-Khan achieved prominence by winning the loyalty of this third faction by persuading them to swear allegiance to him in the first place. Unfortunately, the complicated political nature of our army, the lack of discipline, and Junaid-Khan's dependence on the appeasement of his tribesmen greatly hindered our ability to modernize the army. "
UZB_many_sons_of_oghuz: "The Many Sons of Oghuz"
UZB_many_sons_of_oghuz_desc: "The various Turkmen tribes from the Khwarezm oasis to the Caspian Sea and Aral Sea have never before considered themselves a single people. Even now, the unity of the Khiva Turkmens lies in a common purpose, not in a common culture, language, or geographic location. Junaid-Khan became a hero among them when he united many disparate tribes and led his brave warriors to victory over the Bolsheviks. This great victory and his coronation as Khan of Khiva was enough to begin building the unified Turkmen identity that Khan carefully cultivated over the years, but most of our Turkmens still identify themselves primarily with their tribal groups, and conflicts between these numerous tribes remain woefully high.\n\nEven Despite Junaid-Khan's authority among the tribes, southern Turkmen tribes are challenging his power in the region, probably supported by either Persians or Ottomans. We must try to put them in place and show who is the real leader here."

Some of these areas are still struggling to recover from the devastation of the civil war, and the once famous Trans-Caspian Railway has remained abandoned for nearly a decade. If our economy is to survive, we must take at least minor steps to rebuild functioning infrastructure.

UZB_Turkmen_Identity_desc: "For centuries Khiva was an Uzbek state. And that meant that the state language was Chagatai, the ruling elite were Uzbeks, and minorities received no benefits.\n\nSince Junaid-Khan, a Turkmen from the Yomud tribe, came to power, everything changed. Now the minority ruled the majority. But things changed even more dramatically when the vast Trans-Caspian region, populated predominantly by Turkmen, came under the rule of the Turkmen leader.\n\n\nNow Khiva is an archaic state, stuck in antiquity without any modernization of social life. In recent years, Junaid-Khan has been losing both his legitimacy and prestige among the population of his state. However, on the advice of one of his cronies, Aziz-Khan Chapik, to raise his prestige and legitimacy, Junaid-Khan needed an ideology capable of rallying people around his figure. And quite naturally, this ideology is Turkmen nationalism. \n\nBut the development of this ideology and the full-fledged creation of the Turkmen state requires much effort to unite these disparate and warring tribes and nurture in them a unified Turkmen identity.\n\nStatus of §nTurkmen Identity:§!

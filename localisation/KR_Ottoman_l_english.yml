OTT_Syria_Tooltip_GUI:0 "The Vilayets of Syria stretch out from the city of Aleppo in the North to the deserts of Ma'an and serve as the centre point of §RArab Resistance§! to Ottoman authority.\n\nFrom all the Arab holdings in the Empire, Syria was always seen as the most important which was reflected in its relative economic power. It is also the most politically active region in the Mashriq with the centre of §CBeirut§! and §CDamascus§! forming the forefront of developing §RArab nationalism§!. Once can however not pinpoint where Anatolia ends and Syria begins as the intricate mingling of population groups has made Greater Syria one of the most diverse regions in the world, forming the home to over a dozen religions and ethnicities. This §YSectarian Tapestry§! has hindered the development of a fully Arab nationalist character and the promotion of a §GRegionalist Character§!. Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Homs, etc. all form their own communities with their own goals and ambitions which has led to constant political bickering. This constant fighting between cities and powerful families has in the last few years started to pave the way towards an initial attempt at bringing mass politics and populism to the common people. Successes for now remain limited but the influence from the §RInternationale§! and §RFar-right movements§! on the European continent are flowing through the cosmopolitan city of §CBeirut§!."

OTT_SYR_Abolish_Lebanon:0 "Abolish the Mutasarrifate of Mt. Lebanon"
OTT_SYR_Abolish_Lebanon_desc:0 "For most of its history under Turkic rule, Lebanon was an autonomous emirate governed across the years by Druze clans that pledged loyalty to the Sultan. The favouritism for Druze dynasties in positions of power and granting privileges to Muslim sects soon alienated the vast population of Christians around Mount Lebanon, particularly the Maronites. A series of revolts in the 18th and 19th century culminated in open civil war between Christians and Druze, which transpired simultaneously with the ongoing Tanzimat reforms and the attendant increase in political meddling by Western imperial powers in the Ottoman Empire’s internal affairs. The end result was the Ottomans conceding to European and Maronite demands to grant Christians an autonomous province of their own.\n\nThe First Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon did not last long, however. It was notorious for its Byzantine bureaucracy and the overbearing role that foreign powers played in the region’s internal government. When war arrived on Turkish shores in 1915, Djemal Pasha abolished the autonomous status of the region and forced it into his own Syrian fiefdom. For the Lebanese people, the war would become one of the darkest periods in their history, with a famine claiming the lives of over 100,000 citizens and the cedar trees on which the citizens prided themselves being cut down to fuel the Hejaz Railway.\n\nMilitary government would remain the order of the day in Mount Lebanon until 1921, when after heavy international and local pressure the region was restored to Mutasarrifate status. The strong foreign interests of prewar Mount Lebanon would be kept at bay, however, by fierce opposition from the Ottoman government and by further global instability.\n\nNonetheless, this restoration of autonomy was seen as a betrayal of the centralist ideals and with tensions rising in the other Mutasarrifates of Jerusalem, Kibris and Basra, the government sees these regions as obstacles to its reforms."
OTT_SYR_Centralise_Infrastructural_Maintenance:0 "Integrate Syrian Railroads into the DDY"
OTT_SYR_Centralise_Infrastructural_Maintenance_desc:0 "The 'Devlet Demiryolları Umum Müdürlüğü', or State Railways Administration, which was founded during the early twenties and incorporates a vast portion of the Anatolian Railway Network, will be expanded to maintain and extend the Northern Portion of the Hejaz Railway.\n\nTaking over from a wide plethora of smaller companies and foreign concessions, this will greatly increase the efficiency of our targeted railway expansion and will make it easier for Konstantiniyye to exert its authority over the vast territories it governs in the Levant."
OTT_SYR_Settle_Tribes:0 "Settle the Southern Syrian Bedouins"
OTT_SYR_Settle_Tribes_desc:0 "The Southern Syrian lands around the town of Amman have long escaped Ottoman authority and have been neglected by our predecessors. Mainly used as an access point to the far more important Hejaz, our control over the region is limited to the direct area around the Hejaz Railway and certain pilgrim hotspots along the way to Mecca. This has resulted in a large influx of migrants from Syria, Circassia and even Anatolia which have fled from the conscription and taxation of the North.\n\nNonetheless, the region remains dominated by Bedouin tribes who harass both pilgrims and settlers alike refusing to pay their taxes. To solve this issue, the government has embarked on a large scale settling program of our Arab tribes both here and other regions scattered around Syria."
OTT_SYR_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency:0 "Centralise Tax Collection (Greater Syria)"
OTT_SYR_Central_Tax_Collection_Agency_desc:0 "The present structures established within the wider Syrian region have allowed for a wide plethora of sanctioned tax collectors ranging from the Millet level which distinguishes between religion, the Vilayet level which collects a certain amount of taxes based on an approximate geographical location and the city level which collects 'gifts' for the Damascan elite.\n\nAll together this has not only led to great confusion amongst the taxpayers but also outrage as the tax pressure seemingly increases by the day as each level of authority deems itself worthy of more and more income.\n\nTo eradicate this problem, a new plan has been proposed to combine all tax collection within a singular agency located in Beyrut and from there on better regulate the expenses of the local government."
OTT_SYR_Restrict_Arab_Nationalist_Newspapers:0 "Restrict Arab Nationalist Newspapers"
OTT_SYR_Restrict_Arab_Nationalist_Newspapers_desc:0 "Even though the Arab Revolt ended in a complete failure for the Hashemites and the Arab movement in general, the seeds of Ottoman resistance were planted. A new generation of educated youths has taken it upon themselves as their mission to strive for the creation of an Arab state free from Turkish tutelage and have started to use the media to spread their message across the land. Due to our pitiful literacy rate and the immense distances within our Empire, their message hasn't been able to spread very effectively yet as the ordinary man on the fields has not yet shown a tendency to oppose the Sultan.\n\nThe increasing literacy efforts of the central government though are likely to bring change to this so it may be wise to prevent their message from reaching too many people."
OTT_SYR_Turkish_Integration_Resettlement_Program:0 "Implement the Turkish Integration Program"
OTT_SYR_Turkish_Integration_Resettlement_Program_desc:0 "The Northern Vilayets of Syria, especially Halep, have long been closer to the Turkish world than the Arab centre of gravitas located in the Hejaz and Baghdad. Nonetheless the population of these regions is Arab rather than Turkish and their loyalty should a general Arab revolt occur is questionable at best. To remedy this, the government has designed a plan called the Turkish Integration & Resettlement program which plans to increase Turkish migration to these areas by the sale of government land to those that speak the Ottomanish language.\n\nThis move is likely to anger a vast portion of the Arab population and might reignite new revolts but may in the long run serve as reliable way to ensure the loyalty of the Vilayet."

OTT_Arab_Tooltip_GUI:0 "Containing the Holy Cities of Medina and Mecca, the vast deserts of inner Arabia and the coastal cities of Jeddah, Qatar and Bahrain, the Arab peninsula is a patchwork of §YEmirates§! and §YTribal Rivalry§!. Not only is Ottoman authority here minimal at best but in the deserts of the interior, war is being waged between the §CRashidi federation§! of the North and the §CSaudis§! in the South. As the focus on §YCentralisation§! of the state and §YConsolidation§! of currently held territory remains, many in the capital have argued that the Peninsula is a §RLost Cause§!, a §RWaste of Time§! and a §RDrain on Resources§! that we do not have and that it would be better to exploit the rivalry of the tribes to keep their attention away from the Empire than to §ROverextend§! ourselves and risk awakening a §RUnited Resistance§!.\n\nThe same cannot be said over the §YHejaz§! However, where the Cities grant the Caliph his §GLegitimacy§! and where the earnings of the Hajj provide a valuable asset to the state coffers. Nevertheless the failed §CHashemite Revolt§! has left its scars and although the Ottoman army ensures the stability of the region, it is commonly referred to by common soldiers as one of the worst postings in the empire. §RTribal Raids§! are a near constant affair and as the birthplace of the revolt, the region also serves as a rallying point for various §RArab 'Freedom' Fighters§! whose anger against the regime fulminates in armed aggression towards its soldiers. The completion of the Hejaz railway and its expansion during the 20's has drastically increased our authority over the region but outside of urban regions, a web of bribery, intimidation and loose alliances with its local rulers provides a §RShaky Balance§!."

OTT_ARA_Centralise_Tax_Collection:0 "Centralise Tax Collection (Hejaz)"
OTT_ARA_Centralise_Tax_Collection_desc:0 "The Hejaz vilayet has a special status within our Empire as the Holy Cities, the most important cities on the peninsula, and their importance to Islam have kept many of our centralisation policies at bay with even the Young Turks of the CUP unwilling to touch this old institution. This has almost completely exempted the region from taxation and in fact subsidies called 'surre' are even granted from the Ottoman treasury which are distributed to the poor in Mecca and Medina.\n\nOur current Grand Vizier however is far less open to the continued presence of religious authority in matters of the state and has decreed that the region should pay its taxes just like any other vilayet and has ordered an extensive investigation into the region to establish a central agency in Medina."
OTT_ARA_Salination_Plant:0 "Expand Desalination Operations"
OTT_ARA_Salination_Plant_desc:0 "As the population of the Hejazi cities keeps climbing, the water supply is unable to keep up and in various cities along the Red Sea serious issues are starting to arise. Primitive desalination operations were started in the early 20th century but lack of funds and a focus on Anatolia and Mesopotamia has left the old installations in decline. By utilising new breakthroughs in the scientific field, we should now replace and expand the operation and ensure the Hejazi people have secure access to clean potable water."
OTT_ARA_Settle_Tribes:0 "Settle the Hejazi Tribes"
OTT_ARA_Settle_Tribes_desc:0 "Although one of the most 'urban' regions on the peninsula, the Hejaz still suffers from an extreme lack of urbanisation. Outside cities such as Medina, Mecca and Jeddah most of the population is still of a migratory nature which makes conducting population counts, conscription and taxation nigh impossible. The sheer size of the region has made much authority impossible outside of the Hejaz railway but by consolidating the population in designated areas, Konstantiniyye hopes to more effectively exert its influence."
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Sharif:0 "Abolish the Meccan Sharifate"
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Sharif_desc:0 "Dating back to the late Abbasid era, the office of Grand Sharif of Mecca has as task the protection of the Holy Cities and its surrounding territory. During the late 19th century and after the loss of Egypt, the Hejaz was restructured into the Vilayet of Hejaz with an appointed governor or Wāli. Nonetheless the Sharifate was retained which has created a dualist power structure in the region that has endured to this day. Traditionally granted to the Hashemite family, the office came under serious attack when its former tenant Hussein bin Ali Pasha started the Arab revolt. He was replaced by Irade (imperial decree) in 1916 by Alī Haydar Pāshā who remained loyal to the Sultan throughout the war.\n\nNonetheless the Sharif is growing old and a successor will soon need to be appointed by the Sultan. Centralists within the administration see in this the chance to abolish the ancient office once and for all and solve the governing duality of the region but others have warned that tearing down such an old pillar of Islam may cause serious unrest across the entire Islamic world."
OTT_ARA_Expand_Dubai_Air_Base:0 "Expand the Dubai Air Base"
OTT_ARA_Expand_Dubai_Air_Base_desc:0 "Serving as a key strategic base for the Ottoman air force, the Dubai air strip was constructed in 1935 to link Iraq to Muscat and from there on India. With the threat of Iranian aggression ever looming, the air strip was accompanied by a military base home to 500 soldiers of the Ottoman army. The needs of this small army quickly established in Dubai a lively economy and proved to be a great boon to the struggling harbour.\n\nThe advent of oil in the Arab Gulf has complicated matters for the Ottoman state as whilst they were previously content with superficial control over the Gulf, it has become clear that the petroleum industry will prove to be a key aspect of the future Ottoman state and total control over the Gulf an absolute requirement. For that purpose, the order has been given to expand the Dubai base and establish similar operations across the Gulf."
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Trucial_States:0 "Abolish the Gulf States"
OTT_ARA_Abolish_Trucial_States_desc:0 "The Shaykhdoms of the Gulf have long enjoyed a privileged status in the Arab world, maintaining quasi total control over their little fiefdoms without the risk of foreign invasion. When Britain retreated from the Gulf and the Sublime Porte became their new guardian, life continued much as it had before but slowly the foundations were laid for a far closer relation to the Porte than Britain had ever entertained. Now that the importance of the Gulf is becoming clearer by the day, we can no longer risk limited control over its constituents and need to draw decisive lines on the new world map. To this degree the various Shaykhdoms will be abolished, with authority centralised in the new Vilayet of al-Hasa where, headquartered in Hufuf, the Ottoman Governor-Admiral will rule the Gulf. The various Shaykhs will however not immediately be asked to hand over power as even the hardliners realise this would only lead to unrest, war and other unpleasantness. Therefore the various Shaykhdoms will be reorganised into a collection of Kazas and Sanjaks with the Shaykhs appointed as kaymakams where necessary."
OTT_ARA_Crack_Down_Gulf_Smuggling:0 "Create the al-Hasa Coast Guard"
OTT_ARA_Crack_Down_Gulf_Smuggling_desc:0 "Piracy and smuggling have been a major issue in the Gulf for as long as it has been populated and although British naval operations were able to put a halt to the practice, the war in the Levant and India has seen a massive rise in smuggling as the Shaykh of Dubai fully embraced the practice, establishing his city as the smugglers capital of both the Gulf and the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is clear that this practice cannot continue as whilst it has proven damaging to our foes, it also greatly harms the security of our own shipping in the Gulf and with the rise of the petroleum industry we can no longer sit idly by whilst our precious cargo is captured by 20th century pirates."

OTT_ARA_Military_Mission_to_ARA:0 "Send a Military Mission to [FROM.GetName]"
OTT_ARA_Military_Mission_to_ARA_desc:0 "The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on tribal militias with limited training.

OTT_Greek_Tooltip_GUI:0 "Serving as the upper middle class, intellectuals, artisans and landowners, the Greek population of the Empire is in an interesting position within the state structure. Although the Anatolian Greeks are almost fully intertwined with their Turkish counterparts, the islands of the Adriatic Coast and the special administrative unit of Cyprus are far less attached to Konstantiniyye.\n\nServing as hubs of §RGreek Nationalist§! rhetoric and often adhering to the dream of '§CMegali§!', these islands have proven themselves tricky to control and out of imperial control for multiple decades. Their return to the Empire after the collapse of first Italy and then the British Empire was not seen by all as a positive development and §RAnti-Ottoman§! rhetoric remains strong."

OTT_GRE_Abolish_Mutasarrifate_desc:0 "Although an experiment was executed in the late 19th Century when the Mutasarrifate was temporarily abolished and integrated into the Vilayet of the Archipelago, the attempt ultimately failed as the distance to its new capital (Çanakkale) led to a communication and administrative headache. The decision was ultimately reverted in 1870 when it became independent once more.\n\nA peculiar detail to the administrative status of the island is that for the authorities in Konstantiniyye, the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church on the island served as the sole representative of the entire Greek community and de facto serves as their ethnic leader in most matters.\n\nWith the recent reforms however and the grandiose plans of the OHF to abolish all the special and in their belief ancient structures, the status of the island is questioned once more and it is doubtful that Konstantiniyye will continue to govern the region through a religious proxy."

OTT_GRE_Turkish_Employement_Program_desc:0 "Not only on the Greek isles but also on the mainland, Greek citizens have always taken up high positions within the industry and service industry with doctors, engineers and business owners being mostly Greek. This fairly closed off intellectual advantage has created a large social rift in Ottoman society where the ordinary Anatolian Turk remains stuck in the past and unable to participate in the industrial revolution.\n\nTo improve the status, experience and hopefully skill of these Turks, the government has decreed a new "Employ a Turk" program where business owners will be encouraged through financial aides to employ and train more of the Turkish population. Some of our non Turkish representatives have however countered this with the argument that this unfairly benefits one group of people which is in sharp contrast to the policy of equality proclaimed by the Party."

This is sure to anger a vast portion of the Greek population who will see this as an attempt to Turkify their lands and might lead to violent protest should we not be careful."

Sprouting majestic villas, large plantations and various other displays of their wealth there are even rumours that the Grand Vizier himself has a home there to repose from the tumult in the capital.\n\nThis has however also led to decreased revenue for the state and in a time where every penny counts and should be accounted for, the Ministry of Finance has announced a plan to send inspectors to the islands to turn over all rocks in search for extra revenue."

This granted them land on the island, in the hopes of promoting a Turkish community on the otherwise predominately Greek island. This system has long remained in use and by the 19th Century, Kibris had a vibrant Turkish population centred around soldiers their descendants.\n\nThrough the plethora of wars we have been forced to endure over the decades, we once again have a large amount of Turkish veterans looking to settle down.

OTT_Kurd_Tooltip_GUI:0 "The relationship between Konstantiniyye and the Kurdish population of Eastern Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia has always been a precarious one filled with both cooperation and conflict. When the last Kurdish Princely Houses were dismantled in 1847–48 and Kurdistan was formally placed under direct rule from Konstantiniyye, a loss of native tradition and leadership occurred which has had catastrophic effects for the Kurds. The absence of authority to keep §RTribal Sheiks§! and §RFanatical Religious Leaders§! at bay, led to their increased power in the Eastern Vilayets and years of massacres throughout the region against non-Sunni citizens such as the §CArmenians§! or the §CAlevi§!.\n\nDuring the rule of §YAbdulhamid II§! and the last years of the §YCUP Autocracy§!, these were freely employed to massacres the §CArmenians§! or to restore order to unruly parts of of the Empire and although aversion by the post-war establishement towards these practices is increasing, they still rule the Kurds as their allies such as the §YSufi order of the Naqshbandi§! hold vast §RInfluence§! in the capital and the Empire in general.\n\nThe autonomy they are currently enjoying however is a curse in disguise as the §YOHF§! has clearly shown their intentions to eradicate the regional power of these religious authorities and is planning to fundamentally change the freedom the §RKurdish Sheiks§! currently posses."

On top of that, Ottoman Gendarmerie has trouble providing security to the citizens of the Empire as roads and paths, especially of the mountainous region are filled with bandits and highwaymen which make travel without escort a dangerous affair.\n\nTax Collectors are especially targeted as the Sheiks seem either incapable but more likely unwilling to provide the security necessary for a good functioning administration. As a cherry on top, the little taxes that do get collected more often than not never reach the Capital and either get embezzled or outright stolen.\n\nThe situation thus necessitates a large thorough reform which is likely to uproot a plethora of local traditions and insult existing power structures which will force us to use military force if necessary to make the whole affair be handled in an orderly fashion."

Their usage however quickly diverged from this purpose as they were employed to shut down Armenian nationalist and socialist revolutionaries. Partaking in a wide plethora of punitive actions and massacres on the Armenian population, the Hamidiye became known for their violence and corruption as they enriched themselves greatly. Through these actions, they were also able to achieve a wide degree of influence within Kurdistan, often positioning themselves above the Law and roaming the region with impunity.\n\nThroughout the Weltkrieg, they were able to increase this power even further as they played a key role in the Armenian Massacres. Post-war however, their power started to wane as the lack of Armenians to suppress and the increasing animosity between the Kurds and Konstantiniyye led to an increasing presence of Ottoman troops to pacify the region. Many former Hamidiye were forced to disintegrate and flocked to the banners of religious demagogues, bolstering the ranks of the conservative and extremist resistance to the Kemalist designs."

Serving as a §YBorder Province§!, it was also treated as such with development leaving much to be desired and §RPoverty§! widespread. Furthermore local groups would take control over the region during the 18th century and it would take until the middle of the 19th century before actual Ottoman government could be restored to the region. The 19th century would bring much change to Iraq as in an attempt to counter the Persian and later §RRusso-British Threat§!, the government finally recognised the need for reform and invested considerable resources in settling tribes, constructing communication lines and later infrastructure (shown nowhere better than in the Berlin-Baghdad project). §CMidhat Pasha§!, wali of Baghdad and later the Grand Vizier who would introduce the Ottoman constitution of 1876, marked a significant leap in this regard as throughout the region from Mosul to Basra massive strides were taken.\n\nAs §REuropean Penetration§! rose however around the turn of the century and with the rise of §RArab Nationalism§! after the raid on the Sublime Porte, Iraq (although far less so than its Syrian and Hejazi counterparts) began to think of an alternative to Turkish rule. To counter these sentiments and to ensure a stable frontier, the post-war governments pumped tremendous resources into Iraq to mould it into a modern Ottoman province. §YEducation§!, §YConstruction§!, §YConscription§!, etc all saw massive increases as Iraqi officers and politicians were used to counter Syrian ambitions."

This status however is not liked by all as the government in Konstantiniyye has desperately been trying to abolish it for years now.\n\nWith tensions rising across the globe and the Assyrian question once more coming to the forefront of Ottoman politics in Iraq, some are pushing for a direct resolution to the issue and the immediate abolishment of the zone, restoring the region to the full authority of the Baghdadi Wali."

The British Empire, supported by its formidable fleet was able to provide a better alternative to the pitiful Ottoman navy and even though the Porte recognised this issue, was unable to solve it. The collapse of the British Empire and the shock waves it sent throughout the Middle East have been especially felt in this region as the Ottoman Empire suddenly found itself the main naval power in the Gulf.\n\nIt could however do little with this as the facilities in Basra, albeit reinforced by the British during the Weltkrieg, were incapable of supporting the main Ottoman fleet and as such only a small, insignificant squadron could be placed in this pivotal region. To mediate this issue and once more extend the Sultans power to the Emirates, a development program has been set up to expand the Basra harbour whilst reinforcing the defences around the city to prevent another Fao Fortress catastrophe."

The growing importance of oil for the Ottoman (war) economy however has led many in Konstantiniyye to believe that extra measures should be taken to ensure that should war return to the region, Mosul will clearly throw its lot in with the Turks and that control over Kirkuk can under no consequences be lost.\n\nRapid expansion of the railroads in the region, linking Mosul to Diyarbakir and Kirkuk are vital in this whilst the arsenals of Iraq (usually located in Baghdad) should in some capacity be shifted to Mosul and Kirkuk. Fears of a Fifth Column amidst the Shiite Arabs of Southern Iraq and the Assyrians in Basra are further influencing government policy to take control over the region in its own hands."
OTT_IRQ_Navigation_Law:0 "Enact the Tigris & Euphrates Navigation Law"
OTT_IRQ_Navigation_Law_desc:0 "The Tigris and the Euphrates are the lifeblood of Iraq. For millennia these two massive rivers have brought bounty onto the Iraqi land but have also caused conflict, misery and violence. It thus goes without saying that control over these rivers is of vital importance for any governmental body in Iraq willing to exert control. Nonetheless it would take significant effort from the Ottoman Empire to fully benefit from this water highway as due to unpredictable behaviour and the terrain on which it runs, issues were plentiful.\n\nIn this the British reached a breakthrough in the late 19th century as the introduction of steamers on the river drastically increased both the value of the land and the control by Ottoman officials. A steamer service connected to Oman and Jeddah was set up and whilst Ottoman ships slowly closed the gap with the British, 'damage' was already done. The influence of Britain increased drastically at the loss of the Porte whilst other Western powers found their way into the mostly untapped Iraqi hinterland. The end of the Weltkrieg did little to ameliorate this as British control over the mouth of the rivers remained. It would take until 1927 for the Porte to regain control over its sphere of influence in the Persian Gulf and navigation on the rivers became more and better controlled.\n\nNonetheless Ottoman traffic on the rivers is far from where the government believes it should be. To solve this and to place the entire Land of the Two Rivers solidly under their foot, a new proposal lies on the table to nationalise all transportation and communication companies on the rivers and prohibit foreign vessels from sailing upstream. Furthermore new patrol boats would be acquired to guard the commercial vessels whilst increased checks in the harbours of the various cities should hopefully both catch illegal merchandise and raise revenue." 
OTT_IRQ_Iraqi_Road_System:0 "Expand Farm-to-City Connections"
OTT_IRQ_Iraqi_Road_System_desc:0 "Control over the inhabitants of Iraq remains problematic as an entrenched aversion by the local people to anything even associated with administration prevents a constructive policy. Farmers toiling on the fields and members of the massive tribal confederations see no need in going to urban areas and due to the massive distances in Iraq, this leads to a situation where only those in the cities have an influence on state policy whilst the economy is unable to grow as agricultural goods do not reach an export centre nor do their creators purchase consumer goods, deteriorating the pitiful revenue of what is supposed to be a rich province.\n\nTo solve this issue, the government has chosen to embark on a Farm-to-City project. Constructing and expanding the existing road network, they will attempt to bring the two groups closer to each other and as such boost the economy of Iraq in general. By providing the means, the government hopes that the rural regions will as such transport their goods to the city where enticed by the richness of the modern consumer goods market, they will spread these to their friends and families. To ensure that these roads remain safe, the government has also authorised the purchase of armoured cars for the Iraqi gendarmerie and has commenced training of new mounted police regiments to tackle banditry in the region."

This both brings us an advantage and a disadvantage, as whilst these centres of faith are exerting tremendous influence on the Iraqi population, whose composition has now drastically shifted in favour of Shiite demographic domination, they also provide us with a special way to influence Iranian policy. Many influential imams and religious officials are educated at these sites and those that remain in Iraq still exert their influence over the Iranian realm as proven by event in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nWith relations deteriorating with our Eastern neighbour however, many in Konstantiniyye believe that it would beneficial to our regime to tighten restrictions on Persian pilgrims travelling to the cities and to bring the educational facilities located there under closer supervision of the government."

OTT_Libya_Tooltip_GUI:0 "Actually consisting of three distinct regions, the §Y'Regency of Tripolitania'§! has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Konstantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty and lack of a decent agricultural base made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. Nonetheless, what the Italians would refer to as "§CLibya§!" formed a vital piece in the Trans-Saharan trade as the oases of Fezzan were the last stop before the Sahel. The sheer size of the region ensured that Ottoman control was barely felt outside of a few coastal centres and it would take until the American invasion in the early 19th Century before the Porte would finally take measures to tie it further to the crown.\n\nThe implementation of the §YTanzimat Reforms§! saw little success in the region as only in Tripolitania much progress could be recorded. It would take until the turn of the century before the changes of the Ottoman regime would start to infiltrate the interior but even then, §CFezzan§! and §CCyrenaica§! were left almost entirely untouched.\n\nThe Italian invasion in 1911 did little to effect the general social structure in the region as the Ottomans notables which governed the coastal strip returned from their exile and retook their place in society. As Ottoman attention was drawn to the Mashriq and saddled with the economic depression caused by the Weltkrieg, the region saw §Rlittle economic development§!. §RIlliteracy§! (outside the main cities) is higher than anywhere else in the Empire, the economy still largely depends on the rainfall in a given year and the few industrial operations running before the war have almost all been forced to close down as a §Rlack of export partners and resources§! makes anything but limited agriculture nigh impossible."

Hindered by natural obstacles, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania couldn't be further apart as the great sand sea east of Sirte makes all transportation outside of sea routes nigh impossible. Furthermore many of the more inland territories of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania aren't even connected to the coast which has led to yet another divide between the urban centres of Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata and the pastoral villages deep in the Jabal.\n\nEven though an initial attempt at rail connectivity was attempted in the twenties, this network was uncompleted due to a lack of funding or local enthusiasm. The new government however has made railroads their number one priority and has decreed that it will extend the metal beasts to the far-flung deserts of Tripolitania. Connecting the city of Benghazi with Misrata and Tripoli, this is not only an incredibly ambitious plan but also one likely to weigh heavily on the local population which will be required to cough up a sizeable part of the investment."

OTT_TRI_Fezzan_Expedition_desc:0 "When Ottoman rule was restored to the Fezzan interior during the middle of the twenties, few accepted it with open arms and during the subsequent years the regime in Tripoli decided that maintaining a sizeable force in the region would be too costly. Retreating all troops bar some small garrisons in the urban centres, this has led to an almost entirely autonomous position for the local tribes.\n\nThey remain discontent however and influenced by a resurgence of the Senussi sect, tribes such as the Awlad Muhammad have started to show their resistance to the regime more clearly. Raids on Ottoman garrisons, refusal to pay taxes and be conscripted have caused drastic issues for the few remaining forces in the region.\n\nA military expedition from the coast could restore order to the region but with the large economic crisis still reigning, many wonder if it wouldn't be best to withdraw all garrisons and grant the region de facto self-rule. In Tripolitinia, there is less animus to abandon the region as the valuable date production of Fezzan is essential in a nation with so little rainfall."

As the Ottoman control only really extends to the main urban centres, tax collection in the hinterland is a tricky subject. To solve this, the Ottoman state has attempted to cooperate with the tribes and grant positions of tax collector, administrator, judge and police to certain tribal chiefs. By using tribes to make other tribes pay their dues, the system turned out much more effective than a pure reliance on Ottoman personnel. The issue here however is that the loyalty of those tribes isn't always guaranteed and certain political fluctuations in the Jabal can cause significant issues to the budget of the region.\n\nThe new administration is less keen on continuing this practice and is planning to make greater use of the kuloglu (Tripolitanians with Turkish ancestry) in the administration of the province.

### Politics (Kemalist)
OTT_Judicial_Commision:0 "Found the Judicial Commission"
OTT_Judicial_Commision_desc:0 "As the Ottoman civil code is based on the Sharia, in the shape of the Mecelle, many of the reformers have been attempting to replace it with a modernised and secular variant. An attempt at doing so was started in 1930 but the electoral defeat in 1931, forced the OHF to re-evaluate its position. Now that the party is back in charge, it seems only natural to push it once more."
OTT_Expand_the_Education_Ministry:0 "Expand the Education Ministry"
OTT_Expand_the_Education_Ministry_desc:0 "Fighting an uphill battle ever since the revolution in 1908, the topic of education is of the utmost importance to the OHF. Significant steps have been made in this regard, especially on the matter of co-education, but the decentralisation of the Ottoman Education System remains a thorn in the side. With the upcoming Co-education and Unification Decree, these will be annihilated in one fell swoop!"
OTT_Replace_the_Penal_Code:0 "Replace the Penal Code"
OTT_Replace_the_Penal_Code_desc:0 "Whilst the current Penal Code serves us well, the Grand Vizier has been enticed by reforms enacted in [ITA.GetNameDef]. It not only provides us with a better and modernised code but it also includes special clauses targeting political dissidents such as the syndicalist movement, which seem a useful tool to the administration."
OTT_Single_Party_Dictatorship:0 "Install the Single Party Dictatorship"
OTT_Single_Party_Dictatorship_desc:0 "Ottoman democracy has failed us. Whilst the Grand Vizier is a staunch supporter of the will of his people, he believes that a progressive vanguard is necessary to lift the Ottoman people up. This vanguard can only function if it can act with total power, free from conservative meddling."
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle:0 "Abolish the Mecelle Code"
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_desc:0 "Following the suggestions made by the Judicial Commission, the time has finally come to rid ourselves of the Mecelle. A new civil code, fully secular in nature, will treat all Ottoman citizens as equals and will show the desire to tear down the last conservative anchor points."
OTT_Commision_Ottomanish_Language:0 "Reform the Ottoman Language"
OTT_Commision_Ottomanish_Language_desc:0 "Based on a Perso-Arabic script, many of the more radical reformers within the Party believe the Ottoman language is needlessly complicated and therefore hindering literacy programs. They have therefore pushed towards the adoption of the Latin Script with the necessary adjustments to fit the Turkish language."
OTT_Reform_Millet_System:0 "Reform the Millet System"
OTT_Reform_Millet_System_desc:0 "The Millet System was a creation to ensure that Ottoman citizens who did not practice the Islamic faith could govern themselves and as such limit sectarian conflict. This has over the years however, led to non-Muslim citizens almost completely detaching themselves from the Empire, and has encouraged the disaster that followed in the Balkans. With a new Civil Code, surely this system is no longer necessary?"

OTT_Ottoman_Constitution:0 "Procuring a New Constitution"
OTT_Ottoman_Constitution_desc:0 "Our current constitution dates from 1876 when Abdulhamid II was forced to concede power to the Young Ottomans. Despite a temporary setback between 1878-1908, this same constitution would be brought back by the Young Turks during the constitutional revolution. Many believe the document is dated however and gives unnecessary power to the office of the Sultan. A revision is in order!"
OTT_Secure_Seperation_of_Powers:0 "Guarantee the Separation of Powers"
OTT_Secure_Seperation_of_Powers_desc:0 "When the Empire in 1878 returned to the rule of the Sultan, it quickly became apparent how this was detrimental to the nation. Arbitrary decisions and the concentration of so much power in the hands of a single person who could decree laws, condemn prisoners and take control over estates he fancied will not do in the 20th century. Therefore it is important that we limit the power of the Padishah."
OTT_Reorganise_Vilayet_System:0 "Reorganise the Vilayet System"
OTT_Reorganise_Vilayet_System_desc:0 "The current size of our Vilayets is far too large, and as such encourage concentration of power within local figures. By reducing the size of them and through the expansion of our telegraph and radio network, we can make them more dependent on the capital and have less power to mismanage."
OTT_Millet_Mektepleri:0 "Millet Mektepleri"
OTT_Millet_Mektepleri_desc:0 "The Millet Mektepleri or Nation School is the brainchild of Minister of Education Mustafa Necati and has as grand aim to make the entire Ottoman population literate. Focusing on the age bracket 14-45, these 'schools' are compulsory for all citizens including women and prisoners. After completing a test, the participants will be granted a certificate from the state and join the Modern Ottoman society."
OTT_Emancipation_Push:0 "Emancipation Vanguard"
OTT_Emancipation_Push_desc:0 "Through the co-education act, we have laid the first bricks on the road to emancipation. Nonetheless this is only the beginning as the OHF now also plans to enable women to run for office and vote in the national elections. A variety of professions will also be opened up to women as the war has showed the chronic lack of labour force amongst the Anatolian people."
OTT_Curtail_Religious_Organisations:0 "Curtail Religious Organisations"
OTT_Curtail_Religious_Organisations_desc:0 "If the Empire is ever to advance towards a secular institution, we have to take decisive action against the various religious organisations shouting their opposition to the reforms. The Sufi orders form the most significant hurdle in this as they not only de facto control Eastern Anatolia but have direct contacts with the Caliph who they utilise to remain in power. No more!"

### Maintaining Internal Order (Kemalist)
OTT_Maintenance_of_Order_Law:0 "Pass the Maintenance of Order Law"
OTT_Maintenance_of_Order_Law_desc:0 "Tough times necessitate tough measures and the "Law for the Maintenance of Public Order" is exactly this. To combat the internal enemies of our fair state, this law will extend dictatorial powers to the office of the Grand Vizier and extend the capability of the army to restore public order. Furthermore it will also allow us to crush subversive organisations - such as the opposition - with ease."

OTT_Reeling_in_the_Arab_Vilayets:0 "Reeling in the Arab Vilayets"
OTT_Reeling_in_the_Arab_Vilayets_desc:0 "As political control over the Turkish heartland increases, so should we extend this to our Arab subjects in the Mashriq and Tripolitania. Be it through political appointments, economic development or military force, the old aristocratic order will be pushed out to make place for the new Ottoman citizen, a young, intellectual and proud servant of the Sultan."
OTT_Reform_the_Conscription_System:0 "Reform the Conscription System"
OTT_Reform_the_Conscription_System_desc:0 "Regularly used by the Ottoman army to cover its flanks or to perform the 'dirty' work, irregulars make up a not insignificant amount of our army. They are often recruited from Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi tribes and are highly disloyal and untrustworthy assets to the army. The time has come to eradicate this practice and incorporate any stranglers into the full Ottoman Army."
OTT_Crack_down_on_the_SSNP:0 "Crack Down on Arab Parties"
OTT_Crack_down_on_the_SSNP_desc:0 "Through their printing presses in Beirut and their Radio broadcasts from Cairo, a whole slew of Arab movements has popped up throughout Greater Syria. Fighting against the modernisation of the Empire and trying to persuade people that an "Arab" nation would be beneficial to their lives, it is the duty of any decent government to spare the people from these delusions."
OTT_Order_by_the_Locomotive:0 "Order by the Locomotive"
OTT_Order_by_the_Locomotive_desc:0 "The sheer size of the empire has made control over the periphery tricky for centuries. As the Ottoman system of the 19th century strongly relied on control from the centre, inadequate infrastructure often made responding to crises slow. Pioneered by the Hejaz Railway and later the Istanbul-Baghdad Railway, the empire can now strike anywhere at any time."
OTT_Status_of_the_Autonomous_Regions:0 "Status of the Autonomous Regions"
OTT_Status_of_the_Autonomous_Regions_desc:0 "Under the CUP dictatorship, many of the old autonomous regions and special statuses were firmly abolished in favour of a strong centralised state. Pressured by the international community, conservatives and the Sultan himself, much of their work would be undone after the conclusion of the Weltkrieg. Now that the centralists are back in charge, the time is ripe to finish what our predecessors started."
OTT_Tribunals_of_Progress:0 "Tribunals of Progress"
OTT_Tribunals_of_Progress_desc:0 "Working in close cooperation with the Law on the Maintenance of Public Order, the "Kalkınma Mahkemeleri" are mobile military tribunals sent out by the office of the Grand Vizier to restore order throughout the empire. Headed by dedicated followers of the Pasha, these men will do whatever necessary to ensure the much needed reforms can't be stopped by the banalities of the opposition."

OTT_Reeling_in_the_Anatolian_Vilayets:0 "Reeling in the Anatolian Vilayets"
OTT_Reeling_in_the_Anatolian_Vilayets_desc:0 "Many nationalists see the entirety of Anatolia as one unit but this couldn't be less true as a variety of peoples ranging from Bosnian to Kurdish inhabit its highlands. Furthermore there is a divide between those living on the coast and those of the interior, often been left behind in favour of more prosperous regions. Uniting these people under the modern interpretation of "Ottoman" is thus our task."
OTT_Extend_Authority_Kurdish_Territories:0 "Extend Authority over the Kurds"
OTT_Extend_Authority_Kurdish_Territories_desc:0 "Divided in tribes and other communities, Sheikhs and Aghas still dictate the order of the day in Kurdistan. For over a century, the Ottoman reform movement has been trying to rid themselves of their influence and bring the Kurdish people under the control of Konstaniniyye. Be it peacefully or through the use of force, we will succeed in the end!"
OTT_Expand_Halkevleri:0 "Expand the Halkevleri Program"
OTT_Expand_Halkevleri_desc:0 "Even though our reforms are set to bring greater prosperity, greater freedom and massive strides in all fields many don't agree with this vision. Especially on the countryside many have serious doubts about the length at which the reforms will change society and are afraid these are in fact heresy. To show the people their virtue, we will create the "People's Houses", community centres to explain the programs."
OTT_Eradicate_Military_Disloyalty:0 "Eradicate Military Disloyalty"
OTT_Eradicate_Military_Disloyalty_desc:0 "Most of the military is in full support of their Grand Vizier or his allies in the army but there nonetheless exists a movement that is less interested in Kemals ever increasing power and who believe that many of his programs will not 'fix' the Empire as he claims but instead hasten its demise. We may need to 'correct' this..."
OTT_OHP_Membership_Reward_Program:0 "OHF Membership Reward Program"
OTT_OHP_Membership_Reward_Program_desc:0 "Grasping back to our predecessor, the CUP, politics have become something not solely decided by the privy council but a true mass movement. Whilst this means that we no longer have to pay lip-service to a few select upper class notables, we still need to adapt our program to the needs of our support base or if one doesn't exist, create one ourselves through carefully placed notables."

### Internal Policy Post-CP
OTT_Ottoman_Renaissance:0 "Dawn of the Ottoman Renaissance"
OTT_Ottoman_Renaissance_desc:0 "The Europeans deemed us weak and sickly, the Iranian believed we wouldn't risk confronting them, and the Arabs believed they were an equal match for the power of Turkish boots. With the white crescent on a red field flying on ramparts from Cairo to Lake Urmiah, we have once and for all shown that our decline has been firmly halted and turned around!"

OTT_Reform_on_the_Homefront:0 "Stabilise the Homefront"
OTT_Reform_on_the_Homefront_desc:0 "The necessities of war and the Kemalist reforms which had to be pushed through without the distractions caused by popular sentiment forced our regime to restrict certain 'liberties' of our citizen. With the dead of Mustafa Kemal however, it is quickly becoming apparent that the same authoritarian rule won't remain feasible without his charisma and prestige."
OTT_Lift_Press_Restrictions:0 "Lift Press Restrictions"
OTT_Lift_Press_Restrictions_desc:0 "As part of the authoritarian measures installed to ensure total control over the war situation and to smother conservative/Islamic resistance to the reforms, the press was heavily curtailed and only commentaries backed by the Party were allowed for publication. With the recent pressure on the authoritarian government to liberalise, we should lift the restrictions."
OTT_Repeal_Varlik_Vargisi:0 "Repeal the Varlik Vargisi"
OTT_Repeal_Varlik_Vargisi_desc:0 "The 'Varlik Vargisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government. By putting exorbitant burdens on these groups, the policy both serves to remedy the ever increasing deficit and to bolster the 'National Economy' by pushing the non-Muslims out of business and encourage take-overs by Turkish citizens."
OTT_Lift_Ban_Political_Parties:0 "Lift Ban on Political Organisations"
OTT_Lift_Ban_Political_Parties_desc:0 "As the authority of the central government crumbles on all sides and voices both inside and outside of the Party are calling for an end to authoritarianism, our Grand Vizier has decided to lift the ban on political organisations and organise open elections as soon as possible."

OTT_Egypt_Khedivate:0 "Khedivate Restored"
OTT_Egypt_Khedivate_desc:0 "The focus of the Ottoman state should lay on Anatolia and the Levant as further expansion will only lead to a worsening of our internal troubles and upset the Turkish plurality within the nation. As the deposed Khedive, Abbas Hilmi, still enjoys the luxuries of his Bosporus villa, we could establish closer ties between our two states but keep them as separate entities."
OTT_Cairo_Aleppo:0 "Cairo-Aleppo Development Scheme"
OTT_Cairo_Aleppo_desc:0 "The growing importance of the petroleum industry and the increasing demand from Europe for this black gold, have shifted priority for the Central Planning Board to the development of a strong industrial basis in the Levant and improve the export capacities of the Empire. Utilising the revenue of the oil business, we will furthermore expand the textile industry of Syria. "
OTT_Absorb_Egyptian_State_Assets:0 "Absorb Egyptian State Assets"
OTT_Absorb_Egyptian_State_Assets_desc:0 "The Egyptian aristocracy and a small group of oligarchs control the vast majority of Egyptian land and industry, forcing the Egyptian people to live as impoverished Fellahin on their lands. By enforcing the Ottoman land reform in the newly 'liberated' lands and through sales of these vast estates, we can both fill our coffers and increase Ottoman penetration of their economy."
OTT_Ottoman_Authority_Peninsula:0 "Reaffirm Authority on the Peninsula"
OTT_Ottoman_Authority_Peninsula_desc:0 "For too long have the tribes of the Arabian peninsula been able to raid and plunder Ottoman supply lines and contest our rule on the periphery. To follow in the footsteps of great administrators such as Midhat Pasha, the time has come for the Empire to strengthen its southern flank and crush the influence of Wahabbists and Emirs alike."
OTT_Restore_the_Vilayet_of_Najd:0 "Create the Vilayet of al-Hasa"
OTT_Restore_the_Vilayet_of_Najd_desc:0 "Our hold on the Arabian peninsula has always been a tenuous affair as the state preferred demanding fealty from the local emirs than exert direct control. Change was brought to this when Midhat Pasha retook al-Hasa and extended Ottoman control further inland but pressed on all fronts, the Saudis were able to force us out in 1913. With the discovery of oil, the time has come to restore our rule over the Gulf. "
OTT_Handle_the_Yemeni_Affair:0 "Handle the Yemeni Affair"
OTT_Handle_the_Yemeni_Affair_desc:0 "The Imam has made the crucial mistake to doubt Ottoman superiority on the field of battle and has as such thrown away any chances at retaining the special status of his realm. Holed up in their mountains and believing themselves untouchable by the Ottoman Army, they are in for a rude awakening..."
OTT_Lift_Military_Restrictions:0 "Lift Military Restrictions"
OTT_Lift_Military_Restrictions_desc:0 "As part of the treaty imposed on the Egyptian state after their defeat in the Levantine war, the size of their military was limited to 20.000 as to not present a threat to our interests. The rise of tensions across the world however and the vulnerability of the Canal and the Libyan flank have made us consider lifting these limitations and use the Egyptian manpower to defend the Caliphate."
OTT_United_Once_More:0 "United Once More"
OTT_United_Once_More_desc:0 "The disaster that befell the Ottoman state in the 19th century and which was only aggravated at the turn of the 20th century has now been corrected as Istanbul and Cairo are now finally reunited! To prevent this from happening again however, the government has decreed an extensive reorganisation of both parts of the Empire including economic, administrative and cultural adjustments."
OTT_Haifa_Cairo_Railroad:0 "Construct the Haifa-Cairo Railroad"
OTT_Haifa_Cairo_Railroad_desc:0 "As an important axis throughout the entirety of human history, we should improve the connection between the lands of the Tigris/Euphrates and the Nile delta. Despite earlier attempts to create a direct rail connection, the difference in railway gauges between the Ottoman and former British network halted all efforts. No more!"
OTT_Redraw_the_Vilayets:0 "Redraw the Vilayets"
OTT_Redraw_the_Vilayets_desc:0 "Following the example of Anatolia, an extensive look at the provincial organisation of our new lands is essential to ensure proper integration and modernisation. Therefore we need to step away from the old Vilayet model and carve it up into smaller, more manageable provinces."
OTT_Settle_Sudanese_Issue:0 "Settle the Sudanese Affair"
OTT_Settle_Sudanese_Issue_desc:0 "The question of Sudan’s future has for a while now bothered the government in Konstantiniyye, as unlike with Egypt, there is very little connection between it and the Ottoman centre. The distance further complicates affairs as any effective communication is basically impossible. Therefore the idea now on the table proposes the creation of a separate Sudanese state tightly bound to the Porte."
OTT_Conference_Alexandria:0 "Conference of Alexandria"
OTT_Conference_Alexandria_desc:0 "The current policy of imposed Turkish rule based on our demographic advantage no longer holds true now that the scales have been tipped in favour of the Arabs. This realisation has made many Turkish nationalists redefine their target audience and work towards a more inclusive citizen model. Therefore the Conference of Alexandria has been opened to finally cement the definition of an 'Ottoman' citizen."
OTT_Integrate_State_Monopolies:0 "Integrate State Monopolies"
OTT_Integrate_State_Monopolies_desc:0 "Whilst the Egyptian state didn't include many industrial centres, it nonetheless boasts an impressive agricultural output. Through a system of landowners and Fellahs, a small group close to the crown was able to achieve tremendous power. The time has now come for us to take over these monopolies and integrate them within our own state holdings, as such breaking the power of the Egyptian aristocracy."
OTT_Recreate_Ottoman_Fifth_Army:0 "Standardise Ottoman Army"
OTT_Recreate_Ottoman_Fifth_Army_desc:0 "Although Ottoman policy makes recruitment a non-ethnic/non-religious affair and imposes a draft for all males of age to serve in times of need, the last few wars have proven the reliance of our high command on Turkish recruits as they fear a fifth element in the Christian and Arab population. If we are to exert control over Egypt, this policy will need to be adjusted and an expanded army instated."
OTT_Elevate_Arab_Language:0 "Elevate the Status of the Arab Language"
OTT_Elevate_Arab_Language_desc:0 "After the Weltkrieg and prompted by the Arab movement, Mehmet VI lifted some of the restrictions on the Arab language and made it the second (official) language of the Empire in Arab majority territories. Nonetheless, various institutions such as the military have remained solely Turkish and have caused great consternation from our Arab brethren. The time for full equality has arrived!"
OTT_Expansion_Ottoman_Parliament:0 "Expand the Meclis-i Umumî"
OTT_Expansion_Ottoman_Parliament_desc:0 "The Meclis-i Umumî or the General Assembly serves as the centre of power within our realm and has sole authority over matters of state. With Egypt still under questionable control, this chamber has thusfar remained limited to Mashriqi and Anatolian parliamentarians as to avoid trouble with the re-integration. With the first hurdles behind us however, it is time to expand membership to our new subjects."

### Foreign Policy
OTT_Policy_of_Deterence:0 "Policy of Deterrence"
OTT_Policy_of_Deterence_desc:0 "Too many Ottoman lives have been lost in the dreadful Weltkrieg for us to risk entanglement in a second conflict of the same scope. We should focus inwards and protect what we have, instead of throwing it all away in a fool’s gambit for glory and prestige."

OTT_Relinquish_European_Ambitions:0 "Relinquish European Ambitions"
OTT_Relinquish_European_Ambitions_desc:0 "From an empire centred around 'Rumelia' and the Aegean, wherein the Mashriq and Anatolia was merely the periphery, a drastic shift has occurred in the direction of Anatolia proper. Through wars and the massive population shifts that occurred due to them, we have transformed into a 'Middle Eastern' and Muslim state. Europe is not our enemy and we should make sure they don't see us as such."
OTT_Greek_Turkish_Population_Exchange:0 "The Greco-Turkish Accords"
OTT_Greek_Turkish_Population_Exchange_desc:0 "When the dust settled after the Balkan Wars, the once tightly intertwined ethnic and religious tapestry of the Empire found itself in disarray. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees flooded in from the Balkans whilst in Anatolia the remaining Christians were eyed with increasing suspicion. To solve this, we believe that an exchange between the remainders of both groups will prove effective and provide a detente to the hostile relations between ourselves and the Greek government."
OTT_Balkan_Military_Accords:0 "Balkan Military Accords"
OTT_Balkan_Military_Accords_desc:0 "To prevent further war in the Balkans, our government proposes the creation of the so-called 'Edirne Accords' which would pose limitations on the size of our armies and increase economic activity across our borders. With greater exchange of goods and ideas over these loosened borders, it is hoped that escalation towards war will become much less likely."
OTT_Never_Another_Balkan_War:0 "Peace at Home, Peace in the World"
OTT_Never_Another_Balkan_War_desc:0 ""Osmanlı Halk Fırkası'nın müstakar umumî siyasetini şu kısa cümle açıkça ifadeye kâfidir zannederim: Yurtta sulh, cihanda sulh için çalışıyoruz." - Mustafa Kemal Pasha\n("To describe the stable and general diplomatic policy of the Ottoman People's Party, I think this short sentence is enough: We work for peace at home, peace in the world." - Mustafa Kemal Pasha)"

OTT_Promote_Muslim_Solidarity:0 "Promote Muslim Solidarity"
OTT_Promote_Muslim_Solidarity_desc:0 "The Ummah consists of hundreds of millions of Muslims all united in their common belief for Islamic values. Nonetheless, this community has waged war on itself for over a millennium, and has in the last few hundred years devolved into nothing but a play ball in the hands of the West. We should not blindly strive to enter the Western club but works towards a better, stronger Ummah."
OTT_United_Against_Imperialism:0 "United against Imperialism"
OTT_United_Against_Imperialism_desc:0 "As there was no unified front against the Imperialists, one by one the proud Muslim states fell to the claws of European colonialism. We, as the predominant Muslim power in the world, and the centre of the Sunni faith, should see it as our duty to assist our brethren of the faith, protect them and show that the spirit of the Ummah has not yet been extinguished."
OTT_Maghrebi_Frontier:0 "Reaffirm Ties with Maghreb"
OTT_Maghrebi_Frontier_desc:0 "From Morocco to the former Ottoman regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripolitania, the Maghrebis are held dear in the heart of our government and suffering the hardest from the effects of colonialism. We shall work together to secure a free and strong Maghreb!"
OTT_Oriental_Cooperation:0 "Cooperation with the Orient"
OTT_Oriental_Cooperation_desc:0 "For decades the Ottoman Empire has fostered relations with our distant brethren of the Orient. From the deserts and mountains of East Turkestan to the plains of Central Asia and the Indian lowlands, our brethren are ready to stand together in these troubling times."
OTT_Security_on_the_Arab_Peninsula:0 "Stability on the Arab Peninsula"
OTT_Security_on_the_Arab_Peninsula_desc:0 "Home of Islam, the Arab peninsula forms the centrepiece of any attempt to bring the Ummah closer together. After years of piecemeal dissection by the British, the time has come to provide the struggling economies of the Gulf and the Bedouin of the interior with a real answer to their trouble!"
OTT_Islamic_Economic_Union:0 "Association of Muslim Nations"
OTT_Islamic_Economic_Union_desc:0 "Envisioned as a bloc of mutual prosperity, the Association of Muslim Nations would be an economic alliance with as goal reducing the reliance on European and American goods whilst also boosting domestic industrialisation efforts of the various participating members. If we all bind together, we can't be picked off one by one and exert a certain pressure on the powers that be."

OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality:0 "Abolish Full Neutrality"
OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_desc:0 "We should not kid ourselves any longer. The world is at war and the time for choosing has arrived. We could remain on the sidelines and watch as all sides plunge themselves into despair but then we would also have to contend ourselves with no allies, no partners and an insecure future in the post-war world. Do we really want to risk that?"

OTT_Research_Cooperation:0 "Ottoman-German Research Initiative"
OTT_Research_Cooperation_desc:0 "Ottoman scientific expertise is severely lacking as for one the literacy rate of the Empire is abominable. Furthermore, the Empire was never really able to catch up the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods. Through our newfound connections to the German Empire, we can both access better equipment and educate our own people for the future."

OTT_Alliance_of_Convenience_desc:0 "The Balkans need a firm hand to guide them back on track and end the constant conflict. Our former arch-nemesis in Vienna has similar ideas and might be tempted into forming a bloc to ensure that those are put into action. Furthermore we both share an aversion to the hawkish nature of German meddling and would preferably ward off Russian expansion. Shouldn't we put the past behind us then?"

OTT_modern_equipment:0 "Standardize Military Equipment"
OTT_modern_equipment_desc:0 "Although the Ottoman army is undoubtedly the best equipped force in the entire Middle East, there is nonetheless a massive issue with regards to standardisation with many rifles, artillery pieces and other tools coming from a wide array of manufacturers. This diversity has led to significant strain on our supply lines, further complicated by the unreliability of many of its former owners engulfed by socialist strife. "
OTT_armor_effort_unq:0 "Ottoman Armoured Project"
OTT_armor_effort_unq_desc:0 "Although the army is no stranger to armoured vehicles, sporting a variety of armoured cars during the Weltkrieg and taking command over a variety of Mark V tanks from the British Empire, the empire nonetheless lacks the capabilities of an establish armoured corps.

OTT_edok_desc:0 "The Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi or Ottoman Military College serves as the crowning achievement in the education of the officers of the army and is destined to give ample preparation to the best students who have climbed the ranks of our system. Nonetheless the college is in dire need of restructuring as the curricula have seen little change since the Weltkrieg and are in regards to combined arms severely lacking."
OTT_army_engineers:0 "Army Engineer Schools"
OTT_army_engineers_desc:0 "Founded in 1795 under the reign of Selim III, the Mühendishâne-i Berrî-i Hümâyun serves as one of the most crucial schools in the empire, providing an expansive education into both civil and military engineering. Although the school was temporarily closed during the war as its students joined the army, it has been reopened after the war and expanded with an artillery education school in Anatolia."
OTT_desert_forces:0 "Specialised Desert Regiments"
OTT_desert_forces_desc:0 "Although several attempts had been made already to set up specialised regiments in Libya and Central Arabia consisting of Bedouin and local tribesmen, these operations usually only lasted a few years. This was to change after the Weltkrieg as a new impetus to defend the Southern frontier led to the creation of the Iraqi Camel Corps, a practice that was soon to be imitated all across the Middle East."
OTT_Mass_Production:0 "Maximize Military Production"
OTT_Mass_Production_desc:0 "Back in the day, the arsenals of the Sublime Porte were revered all across Europe, which cowered before the might of the unstoppable Turkish armies. These days are long behind us however as the Empire never quite caught the train of industrialisation, and the once grand arsenals fell silent. This is soon to change however as a new budget for the armed forces has made room for significant investments."
OTT_Specialised_Equipment:0 "Diversify Military Portfolio"
OTT_Specialised_Equipment_desc:0 "The capacity of our domestic armament industry is pitiful at best, as many of the modern tools of warfare are currently left to foreign manufacturing concerns.

OTT_Upgrade_Dreadnoughts_desc:0 "The average person looks upon the visage of a dreadnought and is consumed with fear. Unable to approach the situation tactically they bemoan how difficult it is to sink a dreadnought. Ours need some upgrades and refits to bring them up to modern standards, and they will smash everyone they go up against!"
OTT_Dominance_Black_Sea:0 "Black Sea Shore Defences"
OTT_Dominance_Black_Sea_desc:0 "Although many see our navy as a force to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean, we must also be concerned with the Black Sea. One way we can strengthen our position on this front will be with a strong network of shore defences to blow enemy ships out of the water."
OTT_Basra_Kuwait:0 "Expand the Basra-Kuwait Facilities"
OTT_Basra_Kuwait_desc:0 "Even less thought about than the Black Sea is The Persian Gulf. We DO in fact have a naval base there, and the ability to put a fleet in those waters and beyond. We should take the time to modernize the Basra-Kuwait facilities in case we are needed in the Gulf."

OTT_Naval_Academy_desc:0 "With all of these projects completed recently there is a growing sense that we can do more.

OTT_Samsun_Iktisat_Kongresi_desc:0 "Following the First Economic Congress in Izmir, we will host a second grand event to showcase the progress and capabilities of the Sublime Porte.

OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs:0 "Raise Import Tariffs"
OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_desc:0 "To encourage domestic industry and prevent reliance on foreign construction materials and basic consumer goods, the government will raise import tariffs substantially. Although this is a great boon for the nascent Anatolian industry, many in Beirut, Alexandretta and Haifa fear that this will greatly damage their status as gateways to the Orient."
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime:0 "Restrict Foreign Exchange Regime"
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_desc:0 "Lack of confidence in the Ottoman government has pushed many investors to selling off their Liras in favour of foreign currencies in recent months, to the detriment of its value. By restricting our domestic investors' capacity to sell off their Lira's we can strengthen our currency compared to the leading currencies of the world like the Mark."
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import:0 "Impose Quantity Restrictions on Import"
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_desc:0 "Whilst the government aims to create a strong local industry, it too often finds itself relying on goods imported from the Donau-monarchy or the German Empire. Steel, machinery, chemicals, etc. are all imported which makes us not only reliant on those nations, but greatly hampers domestic goods as they can't compete with the cheap export products of the larger manufactures abroad."
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit:0 "Ziraat Bankasi Credit Program"
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_desc:0 "Originally the brainchild of Midhat Pasha, the Memleket Sandığı was reorganised into the Ziraat Bankasi in 1888. Providing stability and relief for farmers, still the majority of our population, the bank has been greatly expanded over the years. As prices for agricultural goods are in flux, following the collapse of Ukrainian and German markets, the vast reserves of the bank will be used to fight the crisis."

OTT_Balance_the_Budget_desc:0 "When the Ottoman Empire collapsed under the strain of the debts it had racked up during the Crimean War, an international organisation called the OPDA (Ottoman Public Debt Administration) essentially took over our economy. The disgrace and damage it has caused remains a vibrant memory in the minds of many Turkish economists who since have sworn to maintain a balanced budget at all cost."
OTT_Years_of_Progress:0 "Four Years of Progress"
OTT_Years_of_Progress_desc:0 "Inspired in part by socialist systems, the cabinet of our Grand Vizier will decree the next 4-year plan which he has dubbed the 'Four Years of Progress'. With the focus on rapid industrialisation of the Ottoman nation, it wants to greatly reduce the reliance on foreign goods and expand the domestic industry targetting textiles, steel, cement and others."
OTT_Economic_Commisions:0 "Fourteen Economic Commissions"
OTT_Economic_Commisions_desc:0 "Whilst the Ottoman Empire has seen a distinct rise in its industrial capacity and a reduction in dependence on agricultural exports, the empire lacks a clear vision to really guide the nation towards the future. To fix that, the government has decreed the creation of 14 economic commissions, each with their own areas, to formulate a centralised plan for the future."
OTT_Striving_for_Autarky:0 "Striving for Autarky"
OTT_Striving_for_Autarky_desc:0 "With the global market heavily in flux after its share of disasters in the last few decades, many economists in the empire have started to push for ‘autarky’, or economic self-sufficiency. Although the empire has a long way to go, deriving mainly from its lack of a large industrial base, plans for cement, steel, textile, etc. factories have already been approved by the economic commissions."
OTT_Anatolian_Industrialisation:0 "Second Anatolian Industrialisation"
OTT_Anatolian_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Although the National Economy scheme has already led to the development of much young industry in Anatolia, the government sees much room for improvement in the what was only 30 years ago one of the poorer regions of the empire. A variety of industries in construction, tobacco, textile, etc. will serve as the backbone of this new project."
OTT_Sumerbank:0 "Sümerbank Investments"
OTT_Sumerbank_desc:0 "The cornerstone of the OHF industrialisation model, the Sümerbank serves as the primary investor and controller of our rapidly expanding industrial assets. Although it has a hand in most sectors of the 4-Year Plan, its primary focus is on the development of the Turkish Textile industry which after initial successes in Anatolia has been expanded to Homs."
OTT_Lebanese_Industrialisation:0 "Beiruti Industrial Zone"
OTT_Lebanese_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The economic motor of Syria and its primary harbour, the city of Beirut serves an important role in the industrialisation of the Mashriq and also in further centralising authority. Although some have proposed to shift focus more to Damascus or Homs, both established agricultural and manufacturing centres, the government has proven adamant in its focus on Lebanon, supposedly to break the power of Damascus."
OTT_Model_Farm_Project:0 "Expand the Model Farm Project"
OTT_Model_Farm_Project_desc:0 "Created during Kemals first term, the Orman Çiftliği or Forest Farm was set up near Ankara as a private farm but was quickly developped into a "model farm" which by using the most modern forms of agriculture was to serve as a tool to teach the Anatolian farmers new methods. With matters in the capital taking most of the Viziers time, the project is on the verge of being transferred to the government."
OTT_Aleppan_Institute_Technology:0 "Aleppan Institute of Technology"
OTT_Aleppan_Institute_Technology_desc:0 "Although a variety of schools already exists to cater to the Arab population, the only real institutes of technological higher learning are on the West Coast of Anatolia, primarily in the capital. To solve the issue of technical illiteracy of large swathes of our population, making them useless to our industrialisation schemes, Aleppo will be the home of a new engineering institute."
OTT_Monopolise_Railway_Companies:0 "Monopolise the Railway Companies"
OTT_Monopolise_Railway_Companies_desc:0 "The 'DDUM' or State Railways Administration was founded after the war to take over Entente railway concessions, and to finance the construction of further railroads across the Empire. Nonetheless many foreign concessions remained and various privately held tracks refused integration. With the crisis however, many of these companies are on the brink of bankruptcy, opening the way for unification."
OTT_Eastern_Anatolian_Project:0 "Eastern Anatolian Railway Project"
OTT_Eastern_Anatolian_Project_desc:0 "Just like the Americans conquered the Frontier through the iron beasts of the industrial era, so has our government decreed the expansion of rail and other roads into Eastern Anatolia. Around these railroads would then be created a system of villages and towns inhabited by Turks or immigrants of both the Balkans and Caucasus to strengthen the hold of Konstaniniyye over their own "Frontier"."
OTT_Three_Blacks_Project:0 "Three Blacks Project"
OTT_Three_Blacks_Project_desc:0 "Centred around three of the main industrial resources (coal, iron and oil), the three blacks project aims to expand the domestic production to the point that the Ottoman Empire is capable of being self-sufficient. To achieve this goal, the universities of the Empire have in cooperation with institutes all across Europe worked towards the refinement of extraction methods and the exploration of new sites."
OTT_Zonguldak_Mining:0 "Zonguldak Coal Mining"
OTT_Zonguldak_Mining_desc:0 "Already discovered in the 19th century, the coal mines of Zonguldak nonetheless saw little exploitation during most of the century and it was only with the Weltkrieg and the sudden need of coal for the Ottoman fleet that Zonguldak started to assert itself as an important economic centre. With the government plans for domestic steel production in Karabük, Zonguldak is to play a key role."
OTT_Trans_Mashriqi_Pipeline:0 "Finish the Trans-Mashriqi Pipeline"
OTT_Trans_Mashriqi_Pipeline_desc:0 "With the exploitation of Iraqi oil proceeding at an ever increasing pace, hard limits have started to occur as the capacity of shipping in Southern Iraq and the increasingly hostile relations with Teheran have been identified as difficult hurdles to cross. Furthermore since our clients are located in Europe, plans have been drafted to connect the fields of Kirkuk to the ports of Ikenderun and Beirut."
OTT_Tigris_Program:0 "Tigris Development Scheme"
OTT_Tigris_Program_desc:0 "This bustling river is one of the most important natural features of the Middle East, bringing life to otherwise arid deserts and providing an ideal way of communication and transportation. Furthermore, it's not solely an Iraqi river, but also leaves a deep impression on Kurdistan, Anatolia and Syria. By focusing our efforts on this vein, the government hopes to strengthen these *Ottoman* bonds."
OTT_TPC_Kirkuk:0 "TPC Kirkuk Operations"
OTT_TPC_Kirkuk_desc:0 "With exploitation starting in the 20's, the oil fields of Kirkuk have seen rapid expansion by the TPC as increasing government control over the company and a direct need of new revenue for the state has pushed its growth to the max. Nonetheless the vast reserves have only started to be touched and with America in disarray, the government has identified these as essential to the future of the Ottoman state."
OTT_Lower_Mesopotamian_Exploration:0 "Southern Iraqi Oil Exploration"
OTT_Lower_Mesopotamian_Exploration_desc:0 "Although most operations of the TPC and its German-Dutch allies are centred around Kirkuk and Mosul in the North of Iraq, large untapped reserves have recently been discovered in the South of Iraq, near the important harbours of Basra and Kuwait. Since these are also already tightly connected to the Iraqi rail network, TPC has requested a concession from the Porte to expand operations throughout Iraq."
OTT_Basra_Concessions:0 "Sell off Basra Concessions"
OTT_Basra_Concessions_desc:0 "Although a large part of the Basra vilayet was given in concession to the British Empire after the Weltkrieg, many of these ran out of time and were forced to be turned back over to the Ottoman government. Although the government has thus far refrained from offering them up for sale, to protect its own Kirkuk production, they could help reinvigorate the Iraqi economy."

### Political (Fevzi)
OTT_State_of_Emergency:0 "State of Emergency"
OTT_State_of_Emergency_desc:0 "The assassination of the Grand Vizier has shown that the Ottoman state is held captive by radical Islamist extremists, opposed to the unstoppable tide of progress and unwilling to recognise the decay of Ottoman power. We cannot give in to their lack of reason, and as such have to take any measures necessary to ensure the dream of the CUP and OHF remains intact!"
OTT_Replace_Walis:0 "Recall the Walis"
OTT_Replace_Walis_desc:0 "Complacency and a lack of enthusiasm amongst the ruling cadre has steadily led to a decrease in quality and ability of our Walis or governors. If the Ottoman state is to prosper, these corrupt, decadent and unscrupulous individuals have to been torn out and replaced by those loyal to the regime and its grand vision for the future!"
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_Fevzi:0 "Abolish the Mecelle Code"
OTT_Abolish_Mecelle_Fevzi_desc:0 "Following the suggestions made by the Judicial Commission, the time has finally come to rid ourselves of the Mecelle. A new civil code, fully secular in nature, will treat all Ottoman citizens as equals and will show the desire to tear down the last conservative anchor points."
OTT_Reform_the_Millet_System:0 "Reform the Millet System"
OTT_Reform_the_Millet_System_desc:0 "The Millet System was a creation to ensure that Ottoman citizens who did not practice the Islamic faith could govern themselves, and as such, limit sectarian conflict. This has over the years however led to non-Muslim citizens almost completely detaching themselves from the Empire, and has encouraged the disaster that followed in the Balkans. With a new Civil Code, surely this system is no longer necessary?"
OTT_Confiscate_Privy_Purse_Holdings:0 "Confiscate the Privy Purse Holdings"
OTT_Confiscate_Privy_Purse_Holdings_desc:0 "Although the power of the monarchy has seen a steady decline these last few decades under the supervision of ambitious party figures, the crown is still the direct owner of vast swathes of the empire and uses these lands for their own benefit and enrichment. That they are depriving the state of resources in a state of crisis should be unacceptable and will only fund the religious extremists."
OTT_Marechal_Nous_Voila:0 "\"Mareşal biz buradayız!\""
OTT_Marechal_Nous_Voila_desc:0 "'Marshal, here we are!' has steadily developed to be a catchphrase amongst allies of the military regime who see in the great Fevzi Pasha the saviour of the Kemalist dream and a bulwark of stability and prosperity against both religious extremists and socialist revolutionaries."

OTT_Expand_the_Military_Rusdiye_desc:0 "The Rüşdiye were a sort of High School set up as part of the Tanzimat reforms in 1845 to provide for education in the European style. Besides these schools however a variety of military preparatory schools were set up in Anatolia and Iraq to install a disciplined and patriotic spirit into the students. These schools are now the target of education reform, aimed at further strengthening the loyalty to the state."
OTT_Consolidate_Military_Dictatorship:0 "Consolidate the Military Dictatorship"
OTT_Consolidate_Military_Dictatorship_desc:0 "Even though the Marshal supports the notion of democracy, and initially planned an immediate return to parliamentary rule, he has steadily grown disillusioned with the political establishment. Seeing them as a disease weakening the empire from the inside, perfidious voices all around him have urged the Marshal to maintain military rule on the state until we can be absolutely sure our interests are safe."

OTT_Lift_State_of_Emergency_desc:0 "Although the Marshal has shown his clear disgust for the weakness of the decentralists which has led to the crisis the empire only recently has been plummeted in, he still supports the notion of democracy and with the nation stabilised and the economy recovering, he has in cooperation with various political figures decided to hand power back to the establishment and lift the state of emergency."

OTT_Enshrine_Endeavour_Front_desc:0 "Including key politicians from all factions, both decentralist and centralist, this 'Endeavour' front strives to provide a stable transitional government until all foreign threats have abated and the internal situation has been pacified. Consisting largely of military figures loyal to either the OHF or DF, the front nonetheless also includes various Arabs and other minorities to ensure a lasting peace."
OTT_Centralise_State_Authority:0 "Centralise State Authority"
OTT_Centralise_State_Authority_desc:0 "It is only through strong central authority that the farflung regions of the empire can be kept safe and secure. That the decentralists believe we should give in to nationalist and autonomist movements is an outrage and will only lead to the collapse of the Ottoman state and its further dismemberment by foreign vultures."
OTT_Lift_Maintenance_Public_Order_Decree:0 "Lift the Maintenance of Public Order Decree"
OTT_Lift_Maintenance_Public_Order_Decree_desc:0 "Enacted during the aftermath of the political chaos that has gripped us these last few years, the decree served well in enabling emergency measures and swift retribution throughout the lands. As the threat abates however and the foreign threat relinquishes, there is no longer any need for such extreme measures."

OTT_Cooperate_Private_Sector_desc:0 "An alliance of the public and private sector, the new OHF is toning down its étatist rhetoric in favour of closer cooperation with the capitalists and landholders of the Ottoman Empire. No one better to symbolise this marriage than Mahmud Celal Bey who after a successful career in the banking sector will now cooperate with the party into drafting a new economic plan."
OTT_Vilayet_Reorganisation:0 "Reorganise the Vilayet System"
OTT_Vilayet_Reorganisation_desc:0 "The current size of our Vilayets is far too large, and as such encourage concentration of power within local figures.

OTT_Emancipation_Vanguard_FEV:0 "Emancipation Vanguard"
OTT_Emancipation_Vanguard_FEV_desc:0 "Through the co-education act, we have laid the first bricks on the road to emancipation. Nonetheless this is only the beginning as the OHF now also plans to enable women to run for office and vote in the national elections.

After completing a test, the participants will be granted a certificate from the state and join the Modern Ottoman society."
OTT_Incorporate_Kadroist_Movement:0 "Incorporate the Kadroist Movement"
OTT_Incorporate_Kadroist_Movement_desc:0 "Based on the writings of the 'Kadro' paper, there has been a push by the radicalists within the OHF to follow the example of European nations and discard with the notion of a liberal parliamentary democracy as the ideal. Striving for populism, heavy state control and the creation of a vanguard to lift up the ignorant masses, their message is finding a welcoming ear amongst the squabbling OHF elite."
OTT_Committee_Inquest:0 "Establish the Committee of Inquest"
OTT_Committee_Inquest_desc:0 "As the threat to our government remains real, the party has decided to enact emergency measures in the shape of the Tahkikat komisyonu (Committee of Inquest). This committee, consisting solely of OHF hardliners, has been organised like a court with the power to imprison any perceived threat to the state. Other political parties have also been dismantled with their leaders tried by the new Committee whilst the press is silenced."
OTT_Nationalise_Basic_Industries:0 "Nationalise the Basic Industries"
OTT_Nationalise_Basic_Industries_desc:0 "Although the Kemalists made massive strides in their plans to bring the state economy under government control, they have clearly not gone far enough.

OTT_Social_Nationalism:0 "Embrace Social Nationalism"
OTT_Social_Nationalism_desc:0 "Where Western society was already too late and where Russia struggled, the Ottoman Empire provides a solution to the issue of the bourgeoisie. Strongly believing that the empire does not yet have a well established middle and upper class (although many disagree), the Kadroists believe that it is the perfect place to work towards a classless society wherein all can be truly equal, united behind the banner of the Sublime Porte."
OTT_Enact_Separation_Church_State:0 "Enact the Separation of Church and State"
OTT_Enact_Separation_Church_State_desc:0 "If the Empire is ever to advance towards a secular institution, we have to take decisive action against the various religious organisations shouting their opposition to the reforms. The Sufi orders form the most significant hurdle in this as they not only de facto control Eastern Anatolia but have direct contacts with the Caliph who they utilise to remain in power. No more!"
OTT_Union_Party_State:0 "Fulfil the Union of Party and State"
OTT_Union_Party_State_desc:0 "Such as the populists in Russia have achieved, there can no longer be a difference between party and state. The party will from now on become the state and have the complete monopoly on any and all governmental matters. The Caliph, a puppet soon to be torn down, will be allowed to keep his crown but all reactionaries still standing will be brought to swift justice."
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_FEV:0 "Encourage Private Initiative"
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_FEV_desc:0 "The concept of Private Initiative or teşebbüs-ü Şahsi serves most prominently in the discourse of Sabahattin whom has indentified its lack as one of the main reasons for Ottoman decline. Based on the ideas of Demolin, the Vizier pleads for looking for achievement in yourself and selfconfidence and not relying on family or state, supporting the notion of private ownership as crucial to the social and economic development of the empire."
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_FEV:0 "Break up State Monopolies"
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_FEV_desc:0 "Although the DF largely pushes for a liberal agenda in the social sense, it is also no stranger to its economic ideals, and believes that the large state monopolies set up by the CUP and OHF the last few decades, have seriously hampered the economic growth of the Ottoman Empire. Stifling competition and innovation, the government now pushes for privatisation of these monopolies in an attempt to stimulate the free market."
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_FEV:0 "Multi-Level Democracy"
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_FEV_desc:0 "Although Karabekir originally did not plead for autonomy, his discourse of decentralisation almost solely found support amongst autonomist movements and various groups of landed elite. They, seeing the centralising state as a direct threat to their own status, support a system of multi-level democracy wherein not just the Chamber of Deputies but also Provincial Assemblies can be empowered to serve their local units."
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_FEV:0 "Imperial Literacy Campaign"
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_FEV_desc:0 "Education serves as the basis for any functional society, and the lack thereof can be identified as the root cause of our decline for "Living with personal effort needs much virtue. However, we do not have such qualities because of our raising and education style. We want to live without working, we demand wealth without giving effort therefore we aim to become civil servant at the state. Explicitly, our present poverty stem from our educational system.""

OTT_Dismantle_Endeavour_Front_desc:0 "As stability returns to the Ottoman Empire, the need for an all encompassing coalition has disappeared. With our policies these last few months decisively favouring one of the two main power blocs within the coalition, it is only normal that the Sultan will now appoint the leader of said faction as his new Grand Vizier. Let us pray that true and profound beliefs in democracy will finally be achieved."

OTT_Enshrine_Principles_People_desc:0 "Forming the core tenets of the Kemalist ideology, the principles of the people are based on the Chinese ideas but adapted to suit the Ottoman state. Populism, Nationalism, Statism and Reforism will from now until forever guide the Turkish people to an ever brighter future!"
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_FEV:0 "Adopt the Statutes of Autonomy"
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_FEV_desc:0 "Although the Federation model which the Ottoman Empire recently adopted has been seen a massive step forwards for various autonomy and separatist movements, the expansion of Ottoman control towards Egypt, Iran and the Arab peninsula has made policy makers in Konstantiniyye move towards an even more drastic version of decentralisation, wherein provinces can choose to exert even greater control over their internal affairs." 
OTT_Join_Reichspakt_Fevzi:0 "Join the Reichspakt"
OTT_Join_Reichspakt_Fevzi_desc:0 "Although relations with Berlin have cooled since the collapse of the Kemalist regime, we cannot deny that it is German military might that protects the Empire from the Russian bear, and despite concerns from pacifists, we have no choice but to recognise that if the Porte wishes to partake in the New World Order, we must stand united with the Germans in their time of need."
OTT_Join_Entente_Fevzi:0 "Join the Entente"
OTT_Join_Entente_Fevzi_desc:0 "Despicable traitors to all Islam during the Weltkrieg, you will be hard-pressed to find a living soul willing to speak positively of the reactionary French slave state or their Anglo dogs, but, it cannot be denied that the geopolitical reality is leaving us with little choice. German might is crumbling and the clear industrial and military power of the United States may be all that's left to rebuke the Russian bear."
OTT_Join_Copro_Fevzi:0 "Join the Co-prosperity Sphere"
OTT_Join_Copro_Fevzi_desc:0 "As the balance of power shifts from West to East and an alliance between American capital and Japanese spirit has been formed, the time has arrived for the Porte to also relinquish its ties to the old world. Standing strong with our Japanese friends and backed by the industrial might of the US of A, none will be able to oppose us!"

### Foreign Policy (Fevzi)
OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_Fevzi:0 "Abolish Full Neutrality"
OTT_Abolish_Full_Neutrality_Fevzi_desc:0 "We should not kid ourselves any longer. The world is at war and the time for choosing has arrived. We could remain on the sidelines and watch as all sides plunge themselves into despair, but then we would also have to contend ourselves with no allies, no partners and an insecure future in the post-war world. Do we really want to risk that?"
OTT_Revise_German_Bilateral_Agreement:0 "Revise the German Bilateral Agreement"
OTT_Revise_German_Bilateral_Agreement_desc:0 "Established already during the Weltkrieg and continued after, various agreements and trade deals between the German and Ottoman empires play a key role in the economy of the Sublime Porte. With war soon upon us and a clear lack of equipment noticeable within the armed forces, a proposal has been made to provide agricultural produce at lower prices in exchange for German military aid."
OTT_Increase_Ties_German_Empire:0 "Reinforce Ties to Berlin"
OTT_Increase_Ties_German_Empire_desc:0 "As our former allies in the Weltkrieg, many in Turkey have maintained that a permanent alliance to the German state is in the best interests of both countries and have continually asked the OHF cabinets to work towards this goal. With the army now in charge, it seems the time has come to fully realise these plans and bind the two powers closer than ever before."
OTT_Embargo_the_Internationale:0 "Embargo the Internationale"
OTT_Embargo_the_Internationale_desc:0 "Although the syndicalist bloc has not directly destabilised our state, lacking the educated population or unions to sway, it is however rapidly becoming clear that a confrontation will eventually be upon us, and it would be in our best interests to stick to the same marching order that the German Empire propagates."
OTT_Ottoman_German_Research_Fevzi:0 "Ottoman-German Research Initiative"
OTT_Ottoman_German_Research_Fevzi_desc:0 "Ottoman scientific expertise is severely lacking, not least because the literacy rate of the Empire is abominable. Furthermore, the Empire was never really able to catch up the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods. Through our newfound connections to the German Empire, we can both access better equipment and educate our own people for the future."
OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_Fevzi:0 "Vanguard in the South"
OTT_Vanguard_in_the_South_Fevzi_desc:0 "Just like Belgium in the West and Lithuania in the East, we form Germany's Southern frontier and are as such tasked with an important role in guaranteeing their possessions in the region. From geographical features such as the Suez to the Caucasus to strategic ones such as the Oil fields of Iraq and the Chromite mines of Anatolia, we are an invaluable cog in the great machine of the Kaiser."

### Political (Sabahattin)
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Sabahattin:0 "Grand Vizier Sabahattin"
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Sabahattin_desc:0 "The most prominent Ottoman sociologist, Mehmed Sabâhaddin, has been appointed Grand Vizier by the Padishah. The prince who has had a tumultuous past, being forced into exile both under Abdulhamid II in 1899 and two CUP governments, returned after the political detente in the wake of the Great War and has asserted himself as the main force within the decentralist movement. With his appointment, it seems more than likely that he will finally push through his agenda."
OTT_Reform_the_Gendarmerie:0 "Reform the Ottoman Gendarmerie"
OTT_Reform_the_Gendarmerie_desc:0 "After the abolition of the Janissary corps in the early 19th century, a variety of military organisations were established to ensure order and stability in the provinces of Rumelia and Anatolia. With the proclamation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, these organisations were combined into the Jandarma (Ottoman Gendarmerie). This organisation however suffers from an over-reliance on Turkish manpower in its upper cadres, making it a prime target for reform."
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies:0 "Break up State Monopolies"
OTT_Break_Up_State_Monopolies_desc:0 "Although the HIF primarily pushes for a liberal agenda in the social sense, it is also no stranger to its economic ideals, and believes that the large state monopolies set up by the CUP and OHF the last few decades, have seriously hampered the economic growth of the Ottoman Empire. Stifling competition and innovation, the government now pushes for privatisation of these monopolies in an attempt to stimulate the free market."
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative:0 "Encourage Private Initiative"
OTT_Encourage_Private_Initiative_desc:0 "The concept of Private Initiative or teşebbüs-ü Şahsi serves most prominently in the discourse of Sabahattin whom has indentified its lack as one of the main reasons for Ottoman decline. Based on the ideas of Demolin, the Vizier pleads for looking for achievement in yourself and selfconfidence and not relying on family or state, supporting the notion of private ownership as crucial to the social and economic development of the empire."
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy:0 "Multi-Level Democracy"
OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_desc:0 "Although Sabahattin originally did not plead for autonomy, his discourse of decentralisation almost solely found support amongst autonomist movements and various groups of landed elite. They, seeing the centralising state as a direct threat to their own status, support a system of multi-level democracy wherein not just the Chamber of Deputies but also Provincial Assemblies can be empowered to serve their local units."
OTT_Shift_Power_to_the_Provincial_Assembly:0 "Shift Power to the Provincial Assemblies"
OTT_Shift_Power_to_the_Provincial_Assembly_desc:0 "With the creation of Provincial Assemblies a fact, the process of administrative reorganisation has commenced, shifting more and more authority away from the central government in favour of these local bodies. These assemblies, serving as quasi-mini-parliaments for the various regions of the Empire, will better cater to the local cultural and economic needs of the population, as such uplifting the empire as a whole."
OTT_Revise_the_Mecelle:0 "Revise the Mecelle"
OTT_Revise_the_Mecelle_desc:0 "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes. It nonetheless strongly favours the Sunni population of the empire, leading to demands from Christians and Shi'ites alike to replace it with a more modern equivalent."
OTT_Equality_before_the_Law:0 "Equality before the Law"
OTT_Equality_before_the_Law_desc:0 "Although the Ottoman constitution dictates the equality before the law for all Ottoman groups, regardless of religion or ethnicity, the empire remains heavily biased towards its Muslim majority, whose rights are better protected and catered to in all sections of the Ottoman bureaucracy. The Mecelle, based on the Sharia, stands as a key pillar within this and will need strong revision if true equality is to be achieved."
OTT_Distribute_Miri_Land:0 "Redistribute Miri Land"
OTT_Distribute_Miri_Land_desc:0 "Although the ideas of private land ownership were introduced into the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century and land redistribution was performed, large parts of the Empire still remain either state or direct royal property. This absence of private land tenure decreases production, which brings despotism since there is no cause for people to work. As the liberals believe that humanity needs freedom to succeed, we must open these lands to private individuals."
OTT_Repeal_Unification_Law:0 "Repeal the Unification Decree"
OTT_Repeal_Unification_Law_desc:0 "The Unification and Co-education decree, a testament of OHF intentions to reform the state into a secular and modern society, is seen by many conservatives in our coalition as an insult to Islam itself, whilst many liberals see in its centralist approach to education an attack on the Millet system and the initiative of private individuals. Serving as the main election promise on which our coalition was built, its repeal is of the utmost essence."
OTT_Abolish_Senate:0 "Abolish the Meclis-i Ayan"
OTT_Abolish_Senate_desc:0 "The Meclis-i Ayan, the Ottoman equivalent of the Senate, served little use in our political system, being primarily a way for the Padishah to place individuals favourable to his own ideas in positions which could overrule decisions made in the Chamber of Deputies. This extra weight, which only really served to grant excessive salaries to the elite, has been rendered useless as the combination of provincial and the central assemblies provide enough oversight without royal interference."
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_Campaign:0 "Imperial Literacy Campaign"
OTT_Imperial_Literacy_Campaign_desc:0 "Education serves as the basis for any functional society, and the lack thereof can be identified as the root cause of our decline for "Living with personal effort needs much virtue. However, we do not have such qualities because of our raising and education style. We want to live without working, we demand wealth without giving effort therefore we aim to become civil servant at the state. Explicitly, our present poverty stem from our educational system.""
OTT_Revise_Millet:0 "Revise the Millet System"
OTT_Revise_Millet_desc:0 "Since the new Ottoman Civil Code already guarantees equality to all groups within the empire and the provincial assemblies already increase their say in affairs pertaining to their own culture or province, the need for the Millet system has been put into doubt as it currently only causes extra bureaucratic messiness and needless administrative levels."
OTT_The_Sublime_Federation:0 "The Sublime Federation"
OTT_The_Sublime_Federation_desc:0 "Although Sabahattin was fiercely opposed to the creation of a federal model, the HIF has had no choice but to base their program on one of provincial autonomy, as its main supporters, consisting of minority groups, continue to push for more rights. Therefore, the creation of a federal Ottoman system has become unavoidable. This federation, led by the federal assembly and with the provincial assemblies serving as its sub-states, promises to improve the lives of every Ottoman."

### Political (Arslan)
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Arslan:0 "Grand Vizier Arslan"
OTT_Grand_Vizier_Arslan_desc:0 "A Druze prince from the region of Lebanon, Shakib Arslan is well known in conservative circles as Amir al-Bayān ("Prince of Eloquence") and plays a key role in the islamist movement of the empire. Although it may be seen as shocking that a non-Turk was able to achieve the office of Grand Vizier, it is also a clear signal of Konstantiniyye that the growing Arab movement needs a powerful answer."
OTT_Promote_Panislamism:0 "Promote Pan-Islamism"
OTT_Promote_Panislamism_desc:0 "Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte. Its greatest success can be found amongst the subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the war that would likely have been reduced without the efforts of various Islamists"
OTT_Jizya:0 "Institute the Varlık Vergisi"
OTT_Jizya_desc:0 "The 'Varlık Vergisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government. By putting exorbitant burdens on these groups, the policy both serves to remedy the ever increasing deficit and to bolster the 'National Economy' by pushing the non-Muslims out of business and encourage take-overs by Muslim citizens."
OTT_Empower_Sheikh:0 "Empower the Şeyhülislam"
OTT_Empower_Sheikh_desc:0 "The role of the Şeyhülislam can best be understood as the Grand Mufti of all muslims within the Ottoman Empire. Residing over the Ulama, he is responsible for the writing of fatwas and ensure order and discipline within the religious hierarchy making him only second to the Caliph himself. Nonetheless his power was greatly hindered during the CUP regime as he was reduced to a tool to dweep the masses. This needs readjustment!"
OTT_Religious_Education:0 "Prioritise Religious Education"
OTT_Religious_Education_desc:0 "Fiercely opposed to the idea that religious education should take a backseat to the sciences, the education ministry has revised the complete curriculum and has inserted various traditional ideas and obligatory Islamic classes. Nonetheless, Arslan’s ideas do not condemn all forms of modernisation, and they do not refute that which science has proven. He speaks out against imitation of the West but recognises that there are lessons to be learned from them."
OTT_Revise_Constitution:0 "Revise the Constitution"
OTT_Revise_Constitution_desc:0 "As Parliament continues to prove a thorn in our sight, the conservatives are now pushing for the restoration of the right to prorogue parliament without its permission and as such give the Sultan the power to push through the necessary reforms without parliamentary oversight. For after all, shouldn't the Caliph be able to enact his own decrees and reforms?"
OTT_Enforce_Mecelle:0 "Enforce the Mecelle"
OTT_Enforce_Mecelle_desc:0 "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes. Throughout the years our goodwill has been misused by our minorities who have used it to escape Ottoman justice."
OTT_Revert_Social_Reforms:0 "Revert Social Reforms"
OTT_Revert_Social_Reforms_desc:0 "The Kemalists and their allies have besmirched the good name of the Caliphate with their social reforms who are in clear contradiction to the Scriptures. Not only have they encouraged and actively supported an emancipation and unveilment movement, they have also attacked education, justice and other core tenets of our society. If we are to lay a new path, we will need to undo their foolish mistakes."
OTT_Desecularise_Army:0 "Desecularise the Army"
OTT_Desecularise_Army_desc:0 "Inflitrated by Kemalist stooches and secularists, the armed forces of our Grand Caliphate have been besmirched by their bad moral reputation. Furthermore they hang over our heads as a sword of Damocles as they proved in 1909 when they brutally repressed our predecessors during a peaceful demonstration in the capital. They must be torn out if we are to create our new Ottoman state!"
OTT_Caliphate_Of_Old:0 "The Caliphate of Old"
OTT_Caliphate_Of_Old_desc:0 "When the Armies of Islam knocked on the gates of Vienna, none questioned the might of the Ottoman Empire and its Caliph. Now look at us! Suffering defeat after defeat, the empire has been dismantled by the follower of the Cross whilst abroad our muslim brethren are being coerced into cheap Western imitation and complacency, refusing to recognise their roots. Under our Caliph, we shall show them the true path!"
OTT_Mosque_Renovation_Program:0 "Refurbish Places of Worship"
OTT_Mosque_Renovation_Program_desc:0 "Home to the holiest places in all Islam, the Ottoman Empire has in the last few decades nonetheless often shurked its duty to maintain these places of worship and ensure their further development. Mosques in Diyarbakir, Damascus, Baghdad, Konstantiniyye and even in the Hejaz itself are showing clear signs of neglect. We will no longer stand for this rejection of our traditions!"

### Foreign (Liberal)
OTT_Renovate_Sublime_Porte:0 "Renovate the Sublime Porte"
OTT_Renovate_Sublime_Porte_desc:0 "Although used as a nickname for the central government of the Ottoman Empire, the Sublime Porte or Bab-ı Ali also refers to the entrance of the ministries across Topkapi. Sadly many of the these buildings were badly harmed in a fire in 1911 and as such there was a relocation of many of its former inhabitants to the Dolmahbace. With restorations completed, the foreign ministry can finally return."

OTT_Interventionism_Middle_East_desc:0 "Carved up by British hawks and Arab warlords, our subjects on the Arab peninsula have long been drifting apart from us, and have established their own spheres of influence, running counter to our interests. As it befalls the Caliph of all Islam however, it is our duty to protect the safety of the Muslim people and free them from foreign, non-Turkish, meddling."

OTT_Support_Maghrebi_Rebels_desc:0 "From Morocco to the former Ottoman regencies of Algiers, Tunis and Tripolitania, the Maghrebis are held dear in the heart of our government and suffering the hardest from the effects of colonialism. We shall work together to secure a free and strong Maghreb!"
OTT_Reintegrate_MOJ:0 "Reintegrate the M.O.J."
OTT_Reintegrate_MOJ_desc:0 "Torn out of our grand empire by the despicable followers of Jesus Christ, the M.O.J. seems to have finally proven to the West what was already clear to us decades ago. Palestine is the homeland of Muslim Arabs and the arrival of Zionist thieves and other criminal scum has done nothing but destroy the stability and prosperity of our brethren!"
OTT_Intervene_Arab_Unification_War:0 "Intervene in the Arab War of Unification"
OTT_Intervene_Arab_Unification_War_desc:0 "The Houses of Rashid and Saud have been fighting a decades-long war over the ownership of Central Arabia, seeing multiple phases of open conflict interspersed with temporary armistices. Once more, the war has turned hot, and is threatening the safety of our Southern flank, and deputies from Iraq are demanding that the central government intervenes on their behalf."
OTT_Secure_Persian_Gulf:0 "Secure the Persian Gulf"
OTT_Secure_Persian_Gulf_desc:0 "Crucial for the economy of Iraq and with the recent discovery of oil in the wider region, the Persian (or Arab) Gulf has risen to the forefront of Ottoman foreign policy as control over the region has been deemed of the utmost importance. The independent states surrounding it have been deemed liabilities as their questionable relations to the Porte are a serious threat to Ottoman monopoly over Middle Eastern oil."
OTT_Restore_Vilayet_of_Najd:0 "Restore the Vilayet of Najd"
OTT_Restore_Vilayet_of_Najd_desc:0 "Our hold on the Arabian peninsula has always been a tenuous affair, as the state preferred demanding fealty from the local emirs, than exert direct control. Change was brought to this when Midhat Pasha retook al-Hasa and extended Ottoman control further inland, but pressed on all fronts, the Saudis were able to force us out in 1913. With the discovery of oil, the time has come to restore our rule over the Gulf. "
OTT_Incorporate_Muscat:0 "Incorporate Muscat and Oman"
OTT_Incorporate_Muscat_desc:0 "Once a proud empire, the lands of the Sultans of Muscat have as one of the only in the Middle East never been subdued by the armies of the Caliph as friendly relations between the two powers rendered any prolonged military operations unnecessary. The once powerful fleet of Muscat has disappeared now however, and subject to Wahabbist raids, plagued by internal division and shouldering a paranoid and ineffective Sultan, it should be our duty to bring prosperity to Muscat."
OTT_Incorporate_Coastal_Emirates:0 "Incorporate Coastal Emirates"
OTT_Incorporate_Coastal_Emirates_desc:0 "The various Sheikhdoms of the Arab Gulf prospered greatly under British protection, neglecting their duties to the Caliph and indirectly assisting in its demise. When British might disintegrated after their revolution, it was to Ottoman banner that they nonetheless flocked, hoping to preserve their thrones. Strategically important, the government in Southern Iraq has now outlined a plan to bring them closer to the Ottoman centre."
OTT_United_against_Imperialism:0 "United against Imperialism"
OTT_United_against_Imperialism_desc:0 "As there was no unified front against the Imperialists, one by one the proud Muslim states fell to the claws of European colonialism. We as the predominant Muslim power in the world and the centre of the Sunni faith should see it as our duty to assist our brethren of the faith, protect them and show that the spirit of the Ummah has not yet been extinguished."
OTT_Stability_Arab_Peninsula:0 "Stability on the Arab Peninsula"
OTT_Stability_Arab_Peninsula_desc:0 "Since centuries the inhospitable desert of the Arab Peninsula has served as both a natural barrier and a path of invasion for its inhabitants. To defend the rich hinterlands of the Mashriq from said threat, we and empires before us have worked with a string of allies and puppet states on the Southern flank and ensure the prosperity of Mesopotamia can't be harmed. The threat posed by the Wahabbists has shown that more than ever before, Ottoman control over Arabia is of the utmost importance."
OTT_Secure_Oil_Shipping:0 "Secure Oil Shipping Routes"
OTT_Secure_Oil_Shipping_desc:0 "With oil exploitation in Iraq and Bahrain accelerating in the wake of the American collapse, the strait of Hormuz is slowly but surely developing itself into the most crucial access point to these seemingly unlimited reserves. Muscat is weak, divided by overly powerful nobles, religious differences and a decaying army. As such they need our guidance and as such serve as the shield that protects the Gulf from foreign interference."
OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb:0 "Allies in the Maghreb"
OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb_desc:0 "Although lost almost a century ago, the various Muslim states of the Maghreb still look towards Konstantiniyye for guidance, paying their respects to the Caliph. Threatened by the Europeans in their endless drive for expansion, we should close the ranks and form a strong, united and most of all Muslim bloc."
OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient:0 "Allies in the Orient"
OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient_desc:0 "For decades the Ottoman Empire has fostered relations with our distant brethren of the Orient. From the deserts and mountains of East Turkestan to the plains of Central Asia and the Indian lowlands, our brethren are ready to stand together in these troubling times."
OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions:0 "Ottoman Military Missions"
OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions_desc:0 "The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on tribal militias with limited training. These nations have now requested experts from Konstantiniyye to assist them in their modernisation programs, promising great compensation. The program, which hopes to strengthen the Muslim bloc, serves also as an important political tool as sending Kemalist officers could strengthen domestic control over the army."
OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations:0 "Found the Association of Muslim Nations"
OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations_desc:0 "Envisioned as a bloc of mutual prosperity, the Association of Muslim Nations would be an economic alliance with as goal reducing the reliance on European and American goods whilst also boosting domestic industrialisation efforts of the various participating members. If we all bind together, we can't be picked off one by one and exert a certain pressure on the powers that be."
OTT_Council_Economic_Unity:0 "Found the Council of Economic Unity"
OTT_Council_Economic_Unity_desc:0 "As outlined in Chapter 1 of the Economic Unity Agreement, the goals of the council are as follows: "Organize and consolidate economic relations among the States of the Arab League on bases that are consistent with the natural and historical links among them; and to provide the best conditions for flourishing their economies, developing their resources and ensuring the prosperity of their countries.""
OTT_Railway_Connection:0 "Interlink the Railroads"
OTT_Railway_Connection_desc:0 "With the modern age being pushed by cars and railroads, the need for an interconnected railway system has become more than apparent. Due to the difference in colonial occupants, each with their own railway gauge, we will have our work cut out for us, but plans for the unification of rail in Egypt, the Mashriq and Western Persia have already been drafted."
OTT_Joint_Military_Planning:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
OTT_Joint_Military_Planning_desc:0 "Built according to the Ottoman model, our allies and military partners could do with some more guidance from the Sublime Porte. To improve international cooperation and furthermore paint a strong, united picture out of the Istanbul Pact, large scale exercises in the Mediterranean and Northern Syria have already been planned." 
OTT_Reorganisation_Commision:0 "Reorganise the Realm"
OTT_Reorganisation_Commision_desc:0 "Our vigorous desire to reform and adapt has left huge scars on the administrative structure of the realm, as positions, mandates and offices were often not granted to the most deserving or adept, but rather to those whose favour we needed the most. Now that the state has been sufficiently saved from foreign threats however, the time has come for a large-scale clean-up that will purge the empire of its corrupt underbelly."
OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan:0 "Abolish the Vilayet of Yerevan"
OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan_desc:0 "When Armenia was conquered, trouble on the ground and continued guerrilla attacks made control over this far-flung province tricky. In an attempt to pacify the population and ensure that they couldn't pose a threat to our flank, a series of military governors were installed to maintain order. Now that the empire has taken a decisively different course however, Armenian autonomy groups have pushed for the introduction of provincial assemblies."
OTT_Integrate_Yemen:0 "Reintegrate the Immamate"
OTT_Integrate_Yemen_desc:0 "Although a working relation with the Imamate was founded just before the Weltkrieg, it seems that the ambitions of Yahya were too great for this world and with his betrayal during the Levantine war, he has shown his true colours. Therefore it has become clear that the Imamate can no longer exist as a separate entity within the Ottoman Empire, and that it should be replaced by a series of provincial assemblies as to cater to its Sunni, Zaydi and Jewish population."
OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania:0 "Reintegrate the Vilayet of Tripolitania"
OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania_desc:0 "Consisting of three distinct regions, the 'Regency of Tripolitania' has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Konstantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. With the importance of the Western flank rising and the threat posed by the remaining Senussi real, the time has come to reign Libya back in."
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy:0 "Proclaim the Statutes of Autonomy"
OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_desc:0 "Although the Federation model which the Ottoman Empire recently adopted has been seen a massive step forwards for various autonomy and separatist movements, the expansion of Ottoman control towards Egypt, Iran and the Arab peninsula has made policy makers in Konstantiniyye move towards an even more drastic version of decentralisation, wherein provinces can choose to exert even greater control over their internal affairs."
OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan:0 "Reorganise the Kurdish Vilayets"
OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan_desc:0 "Stretching from Anatolia to Iran, the various Kurdish fiefdoms of old have now finally all been integrated within the same state, after centuries of division between Persian and Ottoman suzerains. The huge divide between the Kurdish tribes, in language, culture and religion, has made it difficult to foster a strong nationalist entity, something our government now hopes to exploit to instil a sense of Ottomanism."
OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan:0 "Reorganise the Azeri Vilayets"
OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan_desc:0 "Although Shi'ite compared to our Sunni population, the links between the Turkic peoples of Azerbaijan and Anatolia have always been strong, as a similar language and culture made the exchanging of ideas and goods swift and easy. Finally ripped out of the influence sphere of both Teheran and Berlin, the time has come to reunite the Turkic people and bind them together in a stronger and unbreakable bond."
OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan:0 "Integrate the Emirate of Arabistan"
OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan_desc:0 "Founded in the 15th century, the Emirate of Arabistan has survived as an independent entity in the South-West of Iran clutched in-between the Ottomans and the Persians. Although the treaty of Erzurum in 1847 gave Persia the sole authority over the Emirate, the recent war with Persia has led to the acquisition of the oil rich province. With much of its governance done through the absolute rule of the Emir, much work will be required to make them fit the 20th century."
OTT_Reorganise_Egypt:0 "Reorganise the Egyptian Vilayets"
OTT_Reorganise_Egypt_desc:0 "The disaster that befell the Ottoman state in the 19th century, and which was only aggravated at the turn of the 20th century, has now been corrected as Istanbul and Cairo are now finally reunited! To prevent this from happening again however, the government has decreed an extensive reorganisation of both parts of the Empire including economic, administrative and cultural adjustments."
OTT_Reorganise_Sudan:0 "Settle the Sudanese Affair"
OTT_Reorganise_Sudan_desc:0 "Although Sudan was never a core part of the Ottoman Empire, only being conquered in 1820 under the Ottoman vassal Mohammad Ali, it has now nonetheless found itself within our empire as its ancient connections to Egypt (strengthened under the Khedivate and later Sultanate) led to its incorporation after the Levantine War. Much work is to be done however before 'Turkiyya' will truly become an Ottoman province."
OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly:0 "First Elections of the Grand Assembly"
OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly_desc:0 "As territorial expansion has brought a wide variety of peoples into our empire, the time has come to confer to them the rights of all Ottoman citizens, including the right to send representatives to the Meclis-i Mebusân (Chamber of Deputies). As the size of this body has seen exponential growth due to the vast lands we recently acquired, the body has seen its name changed to 'Büyük Meclisi' or 'Grand Assembly'."

Although this is a great boon for the nascent Anatolian industry, many in Beirut, Alexandretta and Haifa fear that this will greatly damage their status as gateways to the Orient."
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib:0 "Restrict Foreign Exchange Regime"
OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib_desc:0 "Lack of confidence in the Ottoman government has pushed many investors to selling off their Liras in favour of foreign currencies in recent months, to the detriment of its value. By restricting our domestic investors' capacity to sell off their Lira's we can strengthen our currency compared to the leading currencies of the world like the Mark."
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib:0 "Impose Quantity Restrictions on Import"
OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib_desc:0 "Whilst the government aims to create a strong local industry, it too often finds itself relying on goods imported from the Donau-monarchy or the German Empire. Steel, machinery, chemicals, etc. are all imported which makes us not only reliant on those nations, but greatly hampers domestic goods as they can't compete with the cheap export products of the larger manufactures abroad."
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib:0 "Ziraat Bankasi Credit Program"
OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib_desc:0 "Originally the brainchild of Midhat Pasha, the Memleket Sandığı was reorganised into the Ziraat Bankasi in 1888. Providing stability and relief for farmers, still the majority of our population, the bank has been greatly expanded over the years. As prices for agricultural goods are in flux, following the collapse of Ukrainian and German markets, the vast reserves of the bank will be used to fight the crisis."
OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib:0 "Open the Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi"
OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib_desc:0 "According to Law No 3491, this agency will prevent abnormal decrease or increase of the wheat prices against producers and consumers, will protect and regulate the wheat industry, will import or export wheat when necessary, will monitor wheat production trends and market movements in the world, will establish milling facilities and bakeries in locations to be determined and will carry on other similar tasks."
OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib:0 "Balance the Budget"
OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib_desc:0 "When the Ottoman Empire collapsed under the strain of the debts it had racked up during the Crimean War, an international organisation called the OPDA (Ottoman Public Debt Administration) essentially took over our economy. The disgrace and damage it has caused remains a vibrant memory in the minds of many Turkish economists who since have sworn to maintain a balanced budget at all cost."
OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy:0 "Liberalise the National Economy"
OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy_desc:0 "The National Economy model as followed by the OHF has damaged our economy beyond repair, and instead of the promised exponential economic growth, has only served to destroy the prosperity of non-Muslim subjects for the benefit of the ruling class. No more! We will tear down this racist system and in its stead, build a new and prosperous Ottoman economy."
OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology:0 "The Imperial Institute for Technology"
OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology_desc:0 "Although the Ottoman Empire boasts a fair selection of institutes for higher learning, there is a severe lack of technical expertise in the realm, which has severely complicated the industrialisation of the empire. To solve this, the government has proposed to open the Imperial Institute for Technology in Konstantiniyye, in close cooperation with academics from Austria and Germany."
OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law:0 "Repeal the National Protection Law"
OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law_desc:0 "Enacted by the Kemalist government to protect the nascent Turkish industry, the national protection law put severe limits on Turkish imports, banning all imports for goods such as processed food, alcohol, shoes, leather goods and other consumer goods. Furthermore the imports of even materials such as cement received restriction which according to the DF greatly stifled the private sector."
OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment:0 "Enable Foreign Investment"
OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment_desc:0 "Although foreign investment was never blocked by the Kemalist government, who pursued a policy of cooperation between the private and public sector, funded largely by foreign credit, they did make it harder for Ottoman enterprises themselves to solicit foreign funding without going through a state institution. That this has stifled growth is universally agreed on by the liberals and will no longer do!"
OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law:0 "The Foreign Capital Incentives Law"
OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law_desc:0 "Enacted at the request of the DF, the Law on Encouragement of Foreign Capital is meant to reinvigorate the Ottoman economy and make it more accessible for foreign investors through principles such as “free transfer” and “national treatment”. Heavy resistance to the bill was uttered by the OHF however who see this as the destruction of the National Economy model."
OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration:0 "Mesopotamian Oil Exploration"
OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration_desc:0 "Although most operations of the TPC and its German-Dutch allies are centred around Kirkuk and Mosul in the North of Iraq, large untapped reserves have recently been discovered in the South of Iraq, near the important harbours of Basra and Kuwait. Since these are also already tightly connected to the Iraqi rail network, TPC has requested a concession from the Porte to expand operations throughout Iraq."
OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment:0 "Import Agricultural Equipment"
OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment_desc:0 "Although the Ottoman Empire, unlike Egypt, is not yet capped by the size of its agricultural lands, there has nonetheless been a great drive to improve the efficiency of the large estates dotted around the country, through the use of modern equipment. Where the Kemalists primarily intended to set up domestic production of these tools, the liberals have shown a desire to skip this step and import directly from Europe."
OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights:0 "Berlin-Baghdad Exploitation Rights"
OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights_desc:0 "When the original deal for the Berlin-Baghdad railroad was signed with German investors, they were given extensive land grants on either side of the tracks to fully develop and exploit. This arrangement changed near the end of the war however as large investors such as Deutsche Bank pulled out of the project, fearing an imminent collapse of the Ottoman state. Lacking domestic funds, we should bring this deal back."
OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory:0 "Opel Tophane Factory"
OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory_desc:0 "Long discussed with Opel, the idea of a German automotive company establishing a production facility in the Ottoman Empire to cater to the rapidly growing demand for cars in the Middle East is not new. Disagreements about the financing and the nationality of its workers constantly postponed the idea. It was never buried however and our liberal government seems more than willing to reopen negotiations."
OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank:0 "The Turkish Industrial Development Bank"
OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank_desc:0 "Aimed at promoting private initiative and providing loans to industrial entrepreneurs, the Turkish Industrial Development Bank is a government initiative that has been set up after long and difficult negotiations with the ruling coalition. Whilst its primary function for now is to mediate between European exporters and Ottoman importers, it plans to later on establish industries of its own."
OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program:0 "Anatolian Roads Program"
OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program_desc:0 "As the primary focus of the Ottoman economy for most of its history has been on Rumelia, Asia Minor and Syria, the interior of Anatolia is severely lacking the infrastructure expected of a modern nation. Farmers are more often than not disconnected from their villages or cities, causing massive issues for our supply chains and inhibiting the potential of integrating these people in the world economy."
OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership:0 "Privatise Land Ownership"
OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership_desc:0 "The idea of private land ownership is not a new one, but remains as of today a contentious topic in the Ottoman Empire as the promising Land Reform Act, part of the Tanzimat reforms, caused massive social upheaval in the Mashriq, leading to the enforced serfdom of large parts of the Iraqi population and opposition of the conservative bloc who saw in this nothing but a shoddy attempt at European imitation."
OTT_Populist_Economics:0 "Populist Economics"
OTT_Populist_Economics_desc:0 "To their regret, the cabinet has been forced to recognise that the Ottoman people after all weren't ready yet for the full brunt of the capitalist system, and that the long awaited surge in private initiative has proven to be a dud. To remedy this and to cater to the growing unhappiness with the government, they have decided to intervene more heavily in the economy pursuing a populist direction."
OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory:0 "Expand the Turkish Cement Factories"
OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory_desc:0 "A key requirement for the rapid expansion of both industry and real estate, cement factories were the first successful focus of the Ottoman industrialisation plans in the 1920s. Despite this success however, the demand for cement and other building materials keeps climbing and to cater to these needs, the construction of several new factories in Asia Minor has been ordered."
OTT_Sugar_Industry:0 "Expand the Sugar Industry"
OTT_Sugar_Industry_desc:0 "Although sugar beets can be found all across Turkey, it is the regions around Ankara, Konya, Eskisehir, Afyon, Tokat and Yozgat that really power production. As part of the government’s initiative to increase the production of processed food products, large sugar factories have been set up to process the sugar beets and deliver the finished products to the world market."
OTT_Textile_Industry:0 "Expand the Textile Industry"
OTT_Textile_Industry_desc:0 "An important export product of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, the textile industry encountered a large scale decline in the 19th century, as competition with the industrial weaveries of Manchester collapsed the demand for artisanal textiles. The tradition nonetheless still stands and with the collapse of the Western industries to syndicalism, the rise of the Syrian weaveries has taken the world by storm."
OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture:0 "Mechanised Agriculture"
OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture_desc:0 "Whilst the ox and the camel have long been trusted partners of the Ottoman farmer, it has become apparent that they can no longer compete with the smoke-bellowing beasts of the industrial era. Therefore, in cooperation with loosened restrictions on agricultural imports, the liberal government has fully pulled the card of the small landowners and set up structures to assist them in acquiring material."
OTT_Election_Factories:0 "The 'Election Factories'" 
OTT_Election_Factories_desc:0 "Ridiculed by the opposition as "Election Factories", the new liberal government has realised that solely reliance on the free market will not industrialise the Ottoman Empire and has now attempted to outdo the OHF national economy plans by fully committing itself to the rapid expansion of the industry, without any desire to keep a balanced budget. Will this save or destroy the Ottoman state...?"

As the armies of Sultan, Shah and Shaykh plouh through the fertile Mashriqi bosom protected by our Grand Padishah, the initial shock is making room for anger. Anger moves on to a desire for revenge as the previously beaten armies of the Caliph rally back to their standards.\n\nThe battle-drums are beaten, the Imams urge the soldiers to fight for Sultan and Allah, the artillery batteries reloaded and the Turkish army, once an unstoppable tide set to wipe out Europe, smashes into the decadent hordes of our enemies."

# Intro
ott.1.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire before the Weltkrieg"
ott.1.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire, once one of the greatest empires in history saw its decline commence in the late 18th century, developing to the point of being known as the 'sick man of Europe' by the early 20th century. An inability to effectively industrialise, constant foreign meddling in its affairs and a troubling hold on a lot of its provinces meant that the Ottoman Sultanate had fallen back well behind the European powers by 1876. Nonetheless, the Ottomans reformed, and despite the issues these posed on a local level - where tribal issues and a corrupt bureaucracy reigned supreme - light could be seen. Prompted by Mahmud III in the early 19th century and further pursued by the Young Ottomans, radical changes were introduced in the Empire. Land ownership was restructured, the Janissaries eradicated, central rule reestablished in regions such as Mosul and Al-Hasa, and a constitution promulgated. The focus of these reformers was based on the idea of Ottomanism, and attempted to foster a common identity for all its inhabitants besides their local one. It would not be enough. With Abdulhamid II‘s rise to power, a change would come once more.\n\nUnder the pretext of the Russo-Turkish war, the constitution was abolished and parliament sent packing. This period saw a radical centralisation of power under the figure of the Sultan-Caliph. With a constant threat by Christian powers, the Sultan turned towards Pan-Islamism based on the prestige of the Caliphate. Despite enjoying great success from the Muslim population, this would only hasten the departure of the territories without these. Furthermore, his absolute rule fostered great discontent amongst a population which increasingly became familiar with Western ideas.\n\nThis resistance would consolidate itself in the shape of “Committee of Union and Progress”. A coup d'état in 1908 made Ottoman politics, long suppressed by the Sultan, burst into the open. Dozens of parties would attempt to find a seat within the newly restored parliament as it seemed that Ottoman decline was finally at its end. The united democratic forces would not last - and quickly saw a split between the decentralists and the centralists. Through a tumultuous 5 years, these two sides would battle for control. In 1913, with the Raid on the Sublime Porte, the game was up. The centralists, with as significant public figures the Three Pashas, would eradicate all remaining power of the decentralists and shape the nation in their image. Under great threat by the imperialists they ultimately strengthened ties with Germany."

ott.2.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg (Part 1/2)"
ott.2.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire officially entered the Weltkrieg on October 29, 1914, with the arrival of Wilhelm Souchon with the Goeben and Breslau and the shelling of Odessa. The Ottomans won several significant victories in the early years of the war, such as the Battle of Gallipoli and the Siege of Kut; but there were setbacks as well, such as the disastrous Caucasus Campaign against the Russians.\n\nDisaster continued in 1916 with the start of the Arab Revolt, combined with a new British Offensive under the command of General Edmund Allenby. Coming to a head in 1918, devastating defeats in Palestine led to a mass retreat of Ottoman forces. Jerusalem, Damascus and Aleppo fell in quick succession as only the controversial decision by the commander of the Sixth Army to withdraw into the mountains of Anatolia was able to stop the chain reaction. A valiant defeat at Antep and a Pyrrhic victory near Maraş ultimately stopped Allenby in his tracks.\n\nAt that point, the atmosphere of the Empire was rapidly changing, as the Ottoman government realised that even a victory would come at a cost. Furthermore, a change had happened in the palace as well. The CUP puppet Mehmet V had passed away, and in his wake followed the far more assertive Vahdettin. Seeing the collapse of his empire on all fronts, and with the CUP government held responsible for the disaster, he would lash out and attempt to shift power to his allies in the HIF. With the ground heating up under their feet, Talaat Pasha would then, at the instigation of Djemal Pasha attempt to shut down the Sultan. Harsh famine in Istanbul due to a refusal by German forces to supply it with Ukrainian grain, betrayal in the Caucasus by its allies, the attempted silencing of the Sultan and rumours that the commander of the Sixth Army was in open conflict with the ministry of war, would finally tip the bucket over. In a massive wave of anti-German and pacifist fervour, the cabinet of Talaat Pasha was forced to resign and concede to the Sultan.\n\nAhmet Tefvik Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier and tasked with the creation of a government of national unity. Under pressure from the CUP, whose unwillingness to lift their grasp on power made the negotiations collapse, Ahmet Tefvik Pasha resigned and was replaced by Ahmed Izzet Pasha. Creating a government consisting of Cavit Bey, Fethi Pasha and Rauf Pasha, it became quickly clear that the CUP was far from defeated."

ott.3.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg (Part 2/2)"
ott.3.d:0 "The Fall of Greece and the growing risk of revolution in the British Protectorate of Egypt caused Allenby to revise his strategy, and withdraw part of his forces. As France collapsed in late 1919, the War entered its closing stages. In contrast with the Western Front, however, where Austrian forces pushed into Italy and Germans into France and Belgium, the Ottomans at this vital moment had lost over half their Empire - either occupied, or readily vulnerable to a concerted British attack - and were held up by a British force unlikely to stand down. Sultan Vahdettin opened negotiations with the British in an attempt to salvage what remained of his empire, whilst Britain reconsidered its attitude in the Middle East.\n\nWith the Treaty of Copenhagen ceasefire later that year, demanding immediate withdrawal of all remaining Entente forces from the territory of the Central Powers, a rapid solution for the Eastern Question was necessary. Further trouble for the British in Egypt, Afghanistan and occupied Iraq ultimately forced their hand, and the order was given to withdraw. Only Palestine and the Vilayet of Basra would remain under occupation at the insistence of Jan Smuts and Leo Amery. until an acceptable treaty was reached surrounding the 'rights of its minorities', masking their intentions of an Indian base in Iraq and a fortified position near the Suez. With uncertainty in the political climate of the Ottoman Empire, and punishment for the perpetrators of the Armenian massacres far from likely, international opinion shifted away from the Empire, losing much of its support from the Central Powers. An accord was reached in the summer of 1920, wherein two autonomous regions were established, to great anger of both Turks and Arabs.\n\nThe Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (M.O.J.) was be created in Palestine, stretching from the Allenby line to the Red Sea. This de jure part of the Ottoman Empire was to be governed by an International Council consisting of the German Empire, British Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, USA and the Ottomans themselves. Forbidding the entry of Ottoman troops, an international gendarmerie force would maintain the peace within Palestine. In the Vilayet of Basra a new home was to be created for the Assyrian people whose exodus from the plains of Nineveh and Lake Urmia had left them refugees in an Iran openly hostile to their ambitions."

ott.4.d:0 "As formal peace finally arrived in 1921, the borders of the Ottoman Empire had largely remained the same. The oblasts of Kars and Ardahan were recovered with the addition of Yerevan whilst in the Aegean the Italians were pushed out of the Dodecanese. The damage had been immense however as through the actions of the CUP, especially Djemal Pasha, tensions between Turks and Arabs had burst into the open whilst in Eastern Anatolia and Mount Lebanon whole populations were eradicated either through forced deportation or starvation. Losses on the Turkish side had been colossal as well, leading to under-population and a sharp decline in agricultural output - the Empire's main source of income.\n\nAlthough the Arab revolt had been a colossal failure the need for reform was recognized. Answering to the Arab Congress of 1913, the Arabic language was recognized as the second language of the Empire.\n\nIncreasing factionalism within the CUP and the meteoric rise of many military figures tore away at the internal stability of the party. The betrayal by its German allies in Palestine, gave rise to a substantial anti-German faction. As public opinion of the party declined even further, the CUP changed its name to Teceddüt and openly ousted some of the dictatorial figures within. Djemal Pasha went packing, whilst Talaats influence was greatly reduced.\n\nWorking from his position as minister of war, Mustafa Kemal Pasha ousted the German military mission and commenced an ambitious military restructuring. Receiving great acclaim for his actions, Kemal continued laying the foundations for his rise in power. Fearing another Enver Pasha, the upper committee of the party pushed Cavit Bey forward as its leader. Incapable of successfully challenging him Kemal made a succesful bid for power in 1925. The party changed name a second time to the “Ottoman Peoples Party”.\n\n"

ott.5.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire after the Weltkrieg (2/2)"
ott.5.d:0 "The 1926 elections ended in a victory for the OHF, but many were quick to remark that this was less due to the party itself, and more due to fragmentation of the opposition - where more than a dozen parties fought for any given seat. The newly appointed Grand Vizier did not hide his ambitions, and in a flurry of reforms he pushed the nation towards his ideals. Massive strides were undertaken in the areas of education, economic recovery, and the fight against the religious establishment. The authoritarian style of the Grand Vizier, however, lead to a further splintering of the party - when his former ally and friend Kazim Karabekir Pasha broke with the party and created his “Democratic Party”.\n\nUnder threat by the rapid centralisation of the government apparatus and with many conservatives afraid that the OHF may be attempting to break with tradition, the 1931 elections ended in the first electoral defeat for the OHF. The Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation under its leader Haqqi al-Azm became the grand winner of the elections, and formed a coalition with the HIF and the DF to provide a united front against the growing centralist threat. The coalition, however, was under constant attack, as the various parties that played part in it had conflicting opinions on a non-OHF policy. Tensions reached a breaking point in late 1932, when the government of Haqqi al-Azm collapsed due to disagreement with the HIF and DF. A new government was created under HIF leadership, but as a minority government failed in achieving its goals of decentralisation and liberalisation.\n\nThe continued failures by this coalition went a long way in repairing the reputation of the OHF, which received a solid majority in the 1935 elections. As Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha begins his second term in office, signs have started to appear that he may be looking for an alternative to the constant obstruction by the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies and interference from the conservative lobby through the Caliph..."

# Education reform
ottpol.1.t:0 "Education Debate in the Meclis-i Mebusân"
ottpol.1.d:0 "The fight over the minds and spirits of the population has been vigorously fought over the last few decades as the unrelenting pace of modernization has also greatly affected this field. Started deep into the 19th century, the reforms have progressed in a steady progression over the years, mostly carried by the secularist movement. The OHF has continued this conflict post-Weltkrieg with first the participation of women in higher education and official full coeducation only a few years later, promoted by Sultan Vahdettin. Nonetheless, the policy is finding it hard to be fully implemented on the ground as heavy opposition from the conservative Ulemma and the continued split in the various education systems makes any centralization hard to accomplish.\n\nThe Ottoman education system, consisting of 3 main branches, remains divided and even though the idadî and sultanî (reformist schools established by the Tanzimat reforms) have been united into one distinct curriculum, the medreses (religious education) and minority schools (protected by the Millet system) remain a thorn in the side of the Ministry of National Education. Long been a staple of the OHF, it has detailed its plans to unite all three systems, place them directly under the Ministry and to streamline the curricula to both promote social cohesion and make it more approachable to the common citizen. Over the last few years, primarily during their first tenure in 1927, massive strides were made towards accomplishing this goal but the subsequent decentralist government of 1931 has overturned this policy once more in favour of education on a Vilayet level, as such causing a divide in both the quality and accessibility of education depending on efforts of the Wali.\n\nNow that the OHF is firmly back in the saddle, it has brought to the table the sum of its designs: The Coeducation and Unification Act. Finally putting to law the full unification of education in the entire realm and the forced coeducation of male and female, the party has found itself up against a wall of conservative forces funded by the powerful Sufi lodges in an attempt to prevent their power over the government to fade."

As the OHF has a majority in the House after their 1935 electoral success, many are worried that the Sultan may yet interfere through the Meclis-i Âyân (Senate) whose members are almost entirely appointed by the Padishah himself. Known for being a devout Muslim and sharing many of the conservative tendencies of the opposition, the Sultan has kept himself absent from the political process ever since his ascension 10 years ago either because of a general apathy or as some whisper out of fear that what happened to Abdulhamid II may yet happen to him as well. With the future of Religious Education through the medreses now on the line however, many expect the Caliph of Islam to finally take a stance against the secularists."

Showing off the stack of letters he had received from intellectuals all over the empire, the Pasha has once again shown to international press that the people stand behind him. Whether or not this is actually the case is left vague and opposition papers are already describing vividly how this is an affront to the proud traditions of our state."

As the Sultan strictly speaking remained within his jurisdiction, only encouraging the senators to vote against, many see in this the start of increasing interference by the House of Osman with the daily affairs of the Ottoman Parliament.\n\nGrand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha has been seen earlier today making his way to Dolmabahçe Palace to present his opinion to the Sultan and to ensure that no further meddling will occur in the future. Although not making directly threatening the Padishah, the Grand Vizier does not hide his preference for the younger Osman Fuad should the need arise."

#Judiciary reform
ottpol.6.t:0 "Committee for Judicial Reform"
ottpol.6.d:0 "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes.\n\nFor decades this code has remained mostly unchanged and is in the eyes of many still an ancient relic of a bygone era. As it is based on Islamic law, many of the reformists have protested against it as they feel that religious law has no place in a modern secular state. Christian and Jewish citizens who previously used their own legal system remain discontent with it as well, and have urged the government to reform if not outright replace the dated code.\n\nMustafa Kemal, who is likewise averse to its non-secular character, has thus opened a debate into the exploration of legal reform and formed a committee tasked with investigating possible judicial reform. Consisting of Ulemma, administrative personnel and Ottoman representatives from all millets, the committee will hopefully find a solution agreeable by all parties involved and shall present their findings as soon as possible."

Multiple different codes are being discussed as a baseline although an overall tendency towards the Swiss Civil Code, both for its modernity and relatively easy application to the Empire, seems to be prevailing. Others have pointed to the Austrian Empire whose legacy as a multi-ethnic, multi-religious empire is eerily similar to our own. A small core of hardline Ulemma however, have urged their committee members to not abandon the proud traditions of the Sharia code, and have suggested a reform of the Mecelle instead of a complete rewrite."

Both the women’s share in the inheritance and the weight of women’s testimony in the courts is half of that of the men. Subsequently women are also barred from exercising all professions which has given rise to a sizeable emancipation movement clamouring for change as women during the Weltkrieg were forced to take up a wide variety of professions and bonded together in small movements to out their non-violent protests against the government. Education as well, promoted by the late Vahdettin, has allowed women to involve themselves deeper into both politics and kindled in many a desire to perform a variety of strictly male professions.\n\nPolygamy and the vagueness of marital law are also up for reform, as they are not only seen as relics from the past, but an obstruction to future reforms. Legal Marriage as well, now a voluntary action, should be made compulsory according to the Committee for all Ottoman citizens no matter their religion or ethnicity."

Two of the men caught in the attack seem to be affiliated with the OHF party although the latter denies all accountability and has declared that they are being framed by the HIF for an act done by terrorists.

Some have however argued that [OTT.GetLeader] was forced under increasing pressure from the nationalist and secularist military to take these steps and that the only reason for his liberalization drive was to avoid being deposed like Abdulhamid II only two decades earlier. Now that a major parliamentary crisis is shaking the nation and our sultan has for the first time openly interfered in the politics of his parliament, the nation awaits his answer to the issue.\n\nThe OHF has strong ties with the military and has already been angered by the dismissal of their leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha due to direct interference by the Sultan. Looking for an answer to the crisis, they have pushed Mustafa Ismet Pasha forwards as the replacement of Kemal and are unlikely to answer kindly to any candidate not part of their party.\n\nMeanwhile the Liberal opposition is mostly afraid that a continued OHF legislature will push them further on the path of the infamous CUP, and that an end to multi-party democracy may be approaching if the Sultan doesn't take a solid stance against it."

Gendarmerie was unable to catch the perpetrators who fled the scene before the flames were doused and evidence reports seem to be contradictory.

With the Sultan silenced and military high command in the pocket of the OHF, it seems in vain however and many fear that the multi-party democratic system is now formally on its last legs.\n\nThe speech by the Grand Vizier, detailing his plans for the nation and his account of the facts as they happened, was met by several minutes of applause that could be heard from across the Bosporus whilst the opposition looked on in defeat."

To modernize the corps and make it an effective tool to keep our Arab provinces in check, the Grand Vizier has ordained its complete dismantlement and replacement by a new entity, the  Milli Emniyet Hizmeti (National Security Service).\n\nSeveral close friends and associates of the Grand Vizier have however urged him to not take such drastic steps as rumors of a secret organization aligned to the former CUP within the force have thus far not been quelled and some fear that should they feel the temperature under their feet rising, they may lash out and tear down all that we have built."

Even though for now it seems unlikely that their clique is anything apart from a group of people with a shared grudge against the Grand Vizier and his government, they could potentially prove to be an issue further down the line.\n\nAn interesting proposal has also come from the Head of the new Milli Emniyet Hizmeti to use their organization to the benefit of the Party. By keeping constant pressure on its members and their associates, he hopes to have them lash out prematurely and as such be easy prey for his agents. Furthermore an idea was also circulated to use the organization to fabricate a domestic crisis and as such grant an opportunity to the Grand Vizier to consolidate his authority over the administration."

Informing the police of a possible attack on the Grand Vizier, the Wali of Izmir and close friend of Mustafa Kemal, General Kâzim Pasha, quickly shot into action and arrested 5 of the conspirators in their hotel room. Handguns, grenades and even a scimitar were found in the room and all 5 were promptly detained.\n\nShocked by the attempt on his life and by extension, so he says, the Ottoman state, Mustafa Kemal has already ordered the arrest of dozens of possible co-conspirators both high and low in the bureaucracy and including multiple generals (conveniently not those that support him). Without the executive powers to keep them detained however, and with no way to target parliamentarians protected by the constitution from persecution, a special think-tank within the OHF has been tasked with quickly figuring out a way to try all those who are 'associated' with the plot, and grant the powers to the office of Grand Vizier necessary to mop up the remaining conspirators."

Granting the Grand Vizier nigh unlimited power and completely sidelining parliament for as long the nation remains in crisis (decided by the Grand Vizier), an opportunity has presented itself to the OHF to effectively eradicate all remaining opposition to their designs.\n\nMany desperados, veterans and former members of the CUP have already disappeared off the grid in fear of getting dragged into complicity concerning the plot whilst others have already taken the cowards way out. Kılıç Ali Bey, one of these individuals has reportedly shot himself after gendarmerie broke down the door of his home whilst others such as Kara Kemal have left the capital in a hurry to escape arrest.\n\nMembers of the HIF aren't spared either as a wave of arrests targeting them for possible complicity, even though none of them seem to have any solid connection to the plot, is shaking up the capital. Newspapers not following the party line are shut down, military training exercises cancelled, officers temporarily put on leave and the residence of the Grand Vizier put under close guard 24/7 as paranoia or, as some see it, political opportunism takes ahold of the nation."

Only 7 men on the list however were able to be caught by the Gendarmerie as many others departed the country shortly after the failed attempt, or have gone into hiding in the vast hinterlands of Eastern Anatolia. Unfortunately for the Tribunal, this also means that those who were picked up by the Gendarmerie carry the least guilt and although some links to a backroom meeting almost 5 years ago were found, the content of said meeting and whether or not this could be associated with the attempt seems muddy at best."

ottpol.32.d:0 "Upon request by his friend, the Wali of Izmir, the Grand Vizier had scheduled a visit to the Greco-Turkish city earlier this week. Warnings that a potential retaliation strike for his progressive reforms may be imminent, the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti had asked Kemal not to go until the situation was fully under control. Confirmation of a rumoured attack was given three days later when a known criminal in Bursa was apprehended drunkenly blabbering about a vast conspiracy network he was part of against the Grand Vizier and who was given the order to terminate Kemal’s life. Further investigation by the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti ultimately cleared the situation up as the man's imagination and the visit was scheduled two weeks later.\n\nA few days before the convoy would reach the city, further troubling reports started to surface as Gendarmerie apprehended two young men associated with the old Special Organization near the town square. Once again, these were waved away as pure coincidence by the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti.\n\nAs the Grand Vizier entered the city yesterday afternoon and was greeted by the Wali. all still seemed fine. Earlier today however, during a grand speech the Vizier was supposed to hold before a massive crowd which had come out to meet the man himself, two quick gunshots rang through the crowds as the Grand Vizier fell to the ground. Gendarmerie immediately intervened and were able to catch the perpetrator, a young man of Armenian descent whose immediate motive seems to have been revenge for the Armenian Massacres.\n\nMustafa Kemal was immediately rushed to the hospital, but his situation remains far from stable as increasing health issues over the years have greatly impacted the life of our Grand Vizier."

Rumours have also surfaced that Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha may be trying to take the title for himself, and his wide support amongst the military class, who still form the backbone of the party, has both sides scared.\n\nIn the meanwhile, close friend and support of Kemal, Bayar Pasha has assumed emergency powers whilst the nation holds its breath unsure of what may follow if the symbol of Ottoman patriotism perishes."

ottpol.34.t:0 "Death of Mustafa Kemal Pasha"
ottpol.34.d:0 "As his condition remained unstable and on the edge between life and death for over a week, many were starting to lose hope that a quick recovery was imminent. Finally convinced that his end would come, he summoned a few of his closest friends and his adoptive daughter, Sabiha and started writing his will. Upon putting his signature below the text, all medical bulletins were stopped and the final hours of the Vizier started to unfold. Flanked at his bed stand by his secretary, three Turkish doctors and the commander of the Guard, he addressed his final words to doctor Neset Ömer: Aleyküsselâm (Peace to you) - the Muslim reply to a greeting. At 9:05 AM, Ghazi and Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha blew out his last breath. His friend Salih would later burst into his room and upon seeing the body of his patron, step outside and shoot himself in the chest.\n\nWithin the will were his wishes; to bequeath all his property to the party, with a monthly stipend for his sister, and a curious note about his ally Ismet Pasha to whom he left the sum necessary to fund the education of his children, knowing that the man had little riches. More infuriating though is that he stubbornly refused to name a successor, and when his secretary Hasan Riza Bey attempted to extract an oral testament, he was stopped by Celâl leading to great tumult amongst the leading cadre of the party.\n\nParliament in Constantinople was quick to respond as a day of mourning and a joint statement thanking the man for his actions during the war was issued written out to "Halâskâr Gazi", the Savior Gazi (Holy Warrior). No such celebrations were to be found in the OHF headquarters though as the final passing of their leader has led the power struggle to explode into the open."

Former Brigadier-General Kazim Karabekir however and others such as Rauf Pasha see in his message the future of the state, and the only way to avoid decay into a full dictatorship.\n\nIn the other camp, under the still unsecure leadership of Ismet Pasha, plans are made to stick close to the plans uttered by the former Grand Vizier about a progressive vanguard leading the nation into a new era, and a strong guiding hand by the state until the Ottoman people are ready for self-government. Sources indicate that even though the position of Ismet within this camp is still shaky, many military aligned party members have shown their preference to this approach."

The harsh course that seems to now be dominant within the party has former close associates of Mustafa Kemal such as Ali Fuat Pasha, Celâl Pasha and many others forced into abandoning the OHF they helped form and work together with former rival Kazim Karabakir.\n\nSecretary General of the party, Recep Bey has already openly condemned the new party who is currently going by the name of "Democratic Party" - a clear comment on the authoritarian style of the OHF -  and is trying to turn public opinion against them. Aware that their window of opportunity is rapidly closing and the current dominance of the OHF over parliament is unlikely to last, he has also been pressuring Ismet into tightening the belt, shutting down this upstart party and centralize the state around the OHF before their majority in both parliament and the army starts to decay."

ottpol.37.t:0 "A Nation in Crisis"

The organization responsible for the assassination is still at large and many are questioning how the Alīye-i Emniyet Hizmeti failed so catastrophically in defending the Grand Vizier.\n\nRumours of a conspiracy reaching the upper echelons of the Eternal State, are spreading quickly as former friends look at each other in suspicion. Recep Pasha, secretary general of the party, has therefore been pushing Ismet Pasha to enact the so called "Maintenance of Public Order" decree which would give nigh unlimited executive power to the Grand Vizier. Seen by many in the party as a way to permanently shut down any attempts of opposition and the next step in combining party and state, this can be regarded as the path of no return and it is likely that the political scene will take decades to recover from the damage it could cause."

ottpol.38.d:0 "Not only within the party, but also in the Military High Command, has the death of the Gazi caused great disturbance, as even though they openly supported the OHF, its recent decision to drift away from a central authority has left many of the Weltkrieg veterans fearful of increased Arab input within the force and their questionable loyalties. Chief of Army, Fevzi Pasha, was a close friend to the former Grand Vizier and often cooperated with him both in the field and at the drawing desk leaving many to fear that the General may be stepping in to ensure that the policy and ideology of his colleague aren't compromised.\n\nOutside of this circle however, there also remains a divide between officers trained by the German military mission before the war, and those by the revamped Ottoman military standards post-war, with great difference in their opinion of the German Empire and the relation the Sublime Porte should have with it. Nonetheless, the risk of a military take-over seems minimal for the moment and differences between the two sides are, for now, settled behind closed doors."

The move by the Pasha, a long-time friend and former colleague of the late Mustafa Kemal, is by many seen as unexpected, as the man has not shown much inclination to join the political battlefield, preferring a real one, and is very much a testament of the fraternal relations held by the OHF and the Ottoman Army. Recent whispers amongst the upper echelons of the party have it however, that Kemal called him to his side just before his untimely departure and instructed him to lead both the party and the Ottoman nation as a whole further down the path they both envisioned.\n\nGoing in however against the loosely kept rule barring officers from holding both positions in the army and Ottoman parliament, it remains unclear whether his newly announced candidacy for party leadership will also include an early retirement from his former position. Known as a reasonable but also disciplinary man, some fear that he may be steering the nation down a more authoritarian path with closer relations between the army and the state."

To counter possible resistance in the outer vilayets all Walis have been recalled to the capital to discuss further policy and likely be replaced by military men loyal to the new regime. Over in Konstantiniyye itself, Ismet Pasha has been appointed Grand Vizier to ensure a steady hand in day to day affairs but within the political circles it is clear to most that he has mostly been appointed to the position as a puppet for Fevzi's regime."

### Language Reform
ottkem.1.t:0 "Turkish Language Committee"
ottkem.1.d:0 "Even though a wide array of languages is used by the citizens of the Ottoman Empire, earlier attempts to centralize the administration and to increase oversight over local affairs have pushed Turkish more and more to the forefront, making it compulsory for all willing to work for the government, the military and an entry point for a variety of positions high on the social ladder. Nonetheless, the language has proven to be both hard to teach, and hard to be implemented effectively in a modern society, in which telegraph lines play an important role. Consequently it has become mostly a language for the elite, with little appeal outside of the Empire's core territories, as locals prefer sticking with their own languages and dialects. Arabs, the second largest group in the empire, have been especially opposed to its increasing enforcement in a variety of fields and are seeing in it forced Turkification and discrimination.\n\nWhere previous reformers, including even former minister of war Enver Pasha, have left off, our Grand Vizier is taking up the task to both reform the education system and the Turkish language itself in what he claims as the only way for the struggling empire to catch up with the West. As the current Turkish language is based on a Perso-Arabic script, the Pasha has with wide support from the westernizing faction, decided that we should all swap to the Latin script which is easier to teach. Others however fear that this move would be received especially poorly in the Mashriq, and have proposed a middle way wherein the old script would be kept but severely streamlined, as to make it more approachable for the common man. Seeing in this an opportunity to boost Ottomanism further, they envision it as the metaphorical glue keeping the empire together, and a grand language college is already being planned to invite intellectuals from all sides of the Empire to design the language of the future."

The explicit focus on promoting the Turkish language and its users however caused a divide between the Arabs and the Turks of the empire that previously did not exist in such shape or form. The Arab language, a proud and even sacred language for the Islamic world, had to concede further power to the Turkish one, to the great anger of the elites across the Mashriq and the Hejaz.\n\nRemaining the sole accepted language for a wide variety of tasks, offices and day to day necessities, other languages were lifted up in status during the tenure of the OPAD, in return greatly angering both the Turkish and centralist movements, who saw in it weakness and a grave delay to the westernization and modernization of the Ottoman state. With the OHF firmly back in control however, and the Turkish language being adapted to serve a broader public, the Grand Vizier has already announced his intention to re-implement the Turkish language as the sole governmental language accepted in the realm and to change school curricula accordingly."

Encouraged by their professors, students in Damascus and Baghdad have also joined their brethren, as a rare unity in the Mashriq seem to be spreading amongst its people.\n\nNonetheless it cannot be denied that to the majority of the population, the decision has had very little to no effect as their apathy towards the central regime, and the strong reliance on local structures and social constructs make many of these nationwide reforms hard to sink in. Moreover the governments intentions to shut down all schools not teaching the Turkish language are troubled, due to ineffective infrastructure and the sheer size of the Ottoman realm."

From Armenian descent, Secretary-General Hagop served in the Ottoman army during the Weltkrieg where he met the Pasha. Leaving the Empire in 1921, he went on to teach Turkish at the university of Sofia before being summoned by Kemal to the language conference held earlier this year in the capital.\n\nCurious to note as well is the negotiations held between the government and the Türk Ocakları (Turkish Hearts), a Turkish nationalist organization, concerning the institution and possible cooperation between the two to examine the root of the Turkish language and the history of its people.

Serving as a token of our modernist reforms, technological innovation and the future of the Ottoman people, debate rages over its location as many prominent cities have thrown their hat in the ring.\n\nAdana, pearl of Southern Anatolia, has established itself as a key industrial region over the last few decades, further increased by its strategic location close to the Suriye vilayets.\n\nSmyrna, the cosmopolitan melting pot of Greek and Turkish culture is one of the most developed and largest cities in the Empire and has long been seen as both an intellectual and economical hub of the Porte.\n\nTucked away in Iraq, the city of Mosul has seen its importance skyrocket in recent years as the export of oil from the Mesopotamian Vilayets exponentially increases. Close Ottoman supervision over the region, further aided by the Turkoman population and connections through the Berlin-Baghdad railway, has made it a veritable hub of the new Ottoman movement as its choice would be seen by many as a further attempt by the Porte to bring the region under its wing."

Whilst Turkish reaction to the Houses seems to be fairly warm, even in conservative areas despite the message they are portraying, Arabs have shown far less interest with a branch opened in Medina receiving no visitors at all."

### Millet Reform
ottkem.8.t:0 "The Millet System in [GetYear]"
ottkem.8.d:0 "When the Millet system was founded according to the national legend in the Fifteenth Century under Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, the idea behind it was that as Muslim citizens were governed by Islamic Law, so should Christian and other religious minorities be governed according to the laws of their own faith. It is unclear whether or not the system was actually in use before the 19th Century when Sultan Mahmud II split his non-Muslim subjects up in three distinct Millets: Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Jewish.\n\nBowing under international pressure, the Empire was forced to cede more and more power to these bodies after the Tanzimat reforms of the late 19th Century as the various great powers saw it as their sworn duty to protect the various minority groups of the Empire. As the Millet system allowed for a plethora of special powers such as the collection of tax and the creation of new laws for the community, the citizens of these groups became less Ottoman by the day as the Europeans started influencing their day-to-day life more and more, effectively attempting to wrick them away from our Empire.\n\nPressured by the outside world, we had no choice but to watch as the power of Konstantiniyye over the Millets was reduced to practically nil. Efforts by the Young Turks to fight back against the system and to abolish the dreaded Capitulations which allowed European subjects in the Empire to be governed according to European law were only partially successful as none of the Powers was willing to give up its vast influence within our Empire.\n\nThe end of the Weltkrieg however brought a glimmer of hope for the reformists of the Empire, as with the blood of hundreds of thousands of Turkish sons, the dreaded Capitulations were finally abolished as such ushering in a new era of reform for the Eternal State.\n\nThe Millet system has survived regardless though as indecisive politics in the Ottoman Parliament and the need of both coalitions to attract the Christian and Jewish vote have thus far thwarted any attempt at reform."

With Russian, British and French destruction after the end of the Weltkrieg, an end has also come to their meddling in the affairs of the Millets who, without a powerful patron, have seen their power greatly reduced as the sole trading power in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHowever, as the special taxes remained, and with a growing Muslim bourgeoisie, discrimination against the non-Muslim Millets has seen a steady growth over the last few years, to which the government now wishes to answer. Working together with the various authorities within these structures, an agreement was reached today to abolish the old system in return for complete equality for the law for all citizens of the Ottoman Empire under a secularist protective mantle."

ottkem.27.d:0 "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the CUP at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralization and bureaucratization of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders, such that the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state however came a closer connection to the political scene in Konstantiniyye and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HIF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to break of the Kemalist reforms.\n\nConsisting of a wide plethora of orders ranging from the Mevlevi tarikat or "Whirling Dervishes" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led them to become kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his hand and his desire to greatly limit the power of these organizations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders shown his discontent with the direction of his Vizier."

Much would change shortly though and with it the future of the nation.\n\nArriving by ship, a group of 20 men led by a Dervish and accompanied by dog they called Kitmir, the name of the magical dog which had guarded ‘the men of the cave’ in the Koranic version of the Christian legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. The strangers promptly seized the green religious flag of Islam, which was kept in the local mosque, and planted it in the main square. There the dervish, a man called Mehmet, proclaimed himself mehdi (the messiah), and claimed that he was sent by Allah to overthrow the godless rulers in the capital. A crowd of some hundred locals gathered in support, while the majority of the townspeople gaped undecided. Mehmet brandished a gun, announcing that the town was surrounded by the magical number of seventy thousand supporters.\n\nTwo officers pleaded unsuccessfully with the rioters to disperse, and then sent a platoon under the command of a young second lieutenant, Çerkesli Serdar. Serdar drew his gun and fired on dervish Mehmet, using a blank cartridge with which he had been issued for manoeuvres. Unharmed, the dervish declared that he was impervious to bullets, and drawing his gun in turn, wounded Serdar mortally. The lieutenant’s body was then carried to the mosque courtyard, where the dervish cut off his head and stuck it on a pole to the applause of his supporters. Two watchmen who fired on the crowd were killed.\n\nAlarmed by the tumult, a near-by regiment quickly arrived on the scene killing Mehmet and at least a dozen of his supporters. Even though the riot was resolved quickly, the incident has sent shockwaves all the way to the capital where the Grand Vizier is reportedly furious not only at Mehmet but the population of Rize in particular who refused to come to the aid of the brave lieutenant."

In response to this possible connection, the government has sent a court martial under General Mustafa Muglali and has proclaimed martial law in all of Lazistan and vast swathes of Eastern Anatolian land.\n\nWhilst it is very unlikely that an orthodox order such as the Naqshbandi would ever support the messianic claims of Mehmet, reason has long gone out of the window as a regime of terror is installed against all remaining connections between the state and the Muslim faith.

Rumour has it that the mainly Kurdish revolt is also joined by opportunistic elements of the defeated Army of Islam, Secret Organizations, and like-minded clandestine political groups.\n\nCaliph [OTT.GetLeader] has thus far refused to answer to these claims, very well aware of what happened to his predecessor Abdulhamid II in 1909 who was deposed after a failed conservative countercoup. Much like then it seems unlikely that this Jihad will find much success as the main brunt of the Ottoman officer corps remains firmly loyal to the new regime and natural enemies of the Kurds such as the Alevi, Armenians, Turkomans have refused to join the call to arms."

Many Kurdish Sheikhs and Aghas, who see in their cause a way to retain their positions now that has become apparent that Konstaniniyye will enforce direct rule over the region, have been rumoured to associate themselves with the organisation and even pleaded military support should the need arise.\n\nNonetheless, their early discovery by government agents has severely limited their potential as a first wave of arrests and executions is cutting away the head of the snake. Granting an excuse to the Walis of Eastern Anatolia to interfere more directly with Kurdish affairs, gendarmerie and army detachments have also been sent in to replace the affiliated Sheikhs with government agents."

After killing 4 royal guards defending the entrance, soldiers and armed civilians entered palace grounds. Sporadic resistance was offered by palace guards once inside the building. According to an unconfirmed report, the putschists burst into the Royal Chambers of Sultan Abdülmecid II and tried to force his abdication. Unexpectedly, the old and stubborn Sultan pulled out his gold-engraved revolver with a shaky hand, and a terrible firefight ensued. Sultan Abdülmecid II and three of his personal guards were slain in the fighting. Undeterred, the putschists captured Ahmed Nihad Efendi and proclaimed him the new Sultan. It appears that we have no choice but to accept this terrible turn of events!"

He went straight to the Royal Stables and took control of the 300-strong Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment - a ceremonial lancer unit formed from Karakeçili Turkmens. In full ceremonial uniform, armed with lance, carbine and cavalry sabers, the household cavalry charged downhill to the Dolmabahçe palace and crushed the paramilitary rebels positioned outside. Assaulting the palace itself, they chased the rebels through the building, and rescued [Root.GetLeader]. Osman Fuad was reportedly enraged to find the Sultan murdered and swore justice would be done. On his orders, the cavalry regiment was quickly assembled outside the Palace."

Upon reaching the Palace however both units disobeyed their commanders and switched sides to support the well-liked warrior prince. After appointing trustworthy officers to command the formations, Osman Fuad placed a loyalist infantry battalion to guard the Palace and took the other battalion with him to the Parliament. Encountering no resistance at the Parliament, Osman Fuad positioned his infantry to defend the main road and marched on with his cavalry. The elite Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment soon reached the Galata Bridge, held by rebel paramilitary units. The regiment - who regularly crossed this bridge every week to join the Sultan in Ayasofya Mosque - defeated the rebels on the northern side and charged across the bridge to rout the rebels on the southern side. The Sublime Porte lay ahead of them, atop a great hill and defended by rebels."

After hours of heavy fighting across the Bab-i Ali Avenue, Osman and his cavalry routed the remaining rebels and captured the ministries. Once in control of the War Ministry, Osman Fuad Efendi had radio orders sent to all units of the Constantinople Corps to return to their barracks, and spent the rest of the night organising cleanup operations across the city. Some rebels tried to escape by boats while many others simply surrendered. By dawn, all that remained of the rebellion were the bodies and the smell of gunpowder."

Surrounded by an immense crowd, he entered the mosque alone for the sword ceremony. After brief prayers by clergymen, the ancient Sword of Osman was brought forward. Osman Fuad astonished everyone present by taking the sword and tying it to his belt himself, in defiance of the customs. The ceremony ended with the declaration of the new Padişah to the public. Later that day, the 44-year-old Sultan visited the tombs of his ancestors around the old city in preparation of his sovereign duties as Sultan Osman-ı Rābi'."

As such it came as no surprise to the Ottoman people that the former Grand Vizier of the late Sultan Abdulmecid II was summoned earlier today to the Palace to discuss the future of the Empire.\n\nAgreeing on a wide selection of topics, the Sultan has requested from Kemal that he fully presents his plans for the future of the State and has bestowed upon him the office of the Grand Vizier once more."

Years of stress, smoking and bad drinking habits are greatly weighing him down and have led to a steady decrease of time spent in public.\n\nAlthough always remaining stubborn and refusing to resign, many of the day-to-day affairs have behind the scenes already been transferred over to his trusted friend Ismet, who seems set to succeed the Lion of Antep himself. Whether Ismet will be capable of maintaining the same degree of authority is however far less certain, and talks with various opposition figures concerning toning down the heavy restrictions are being conducted behind the back of the Grand Vizier."

ottkem.52.t:0 "Death of Mustafa Kemal Pasha"
ottkem.52.d:0 "As his condition deteriorated only further in the next few weeks, many were convinced that the final days of the Grand Vizier were finally upon us. Accepting his own fate, the man summoned a few of his closest friends and his adoptive daughter, Sabiha and started writing his will. Upon putting his signature below the text, all medical bulletins were stopped and the final hours of the Vizier started to unfold. Flanked at his bed stand by his secretary, three Turkish doctors and the commander of the Guard, he addressed his final words to doctor Neset Ömer: Aleyküsselâm (Peace to you) - the Muslim reply to a greeting. At 9:05 AM, Ghazi and Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha blew out his last breath. His friend Salih would later burst into his room and upon seeing the body of his patron, step outside and shoot himself in the chest.\n\nWithin the will were his wishes to bequeath all his property to the party, with a monthly stipend for his sister, and a curious note about his ally Ismet Pasha to whom he left the sum necessary to fund the education of his children, knowing that the man had little riches. Furthermore he also officially nominated Ismet as his successor, referring party leadership to Cêlal.\n\nParliament in Constantinople was quick to respond with an official day of mourning, and a joint statement thanking the man for his actions during the war was issued written out to "Halâskâr Gazi", the Savior Gazi (Holy Warrior). Various vessels, both small and large, military and civilian furthermore sailed in front of his seashore villa, shouting, crying and waving the Ottoman flag in memory of the man now forever captivated in the legacy of our Grand Empire."

ottkem.53.t:0 "Elections of [GetYear]"
ottkem.53.d:0 "Despite a lack of parties, which were abolished only a few years ago, there has nonetheless been a real impetus by the political establishment to challenge the ruling OHF power bloc. The OHF from their end has abstained from blocking candidates of many moderate (former) parties to run as the Grand Vizier has shown his understanding that at least a limited form of democracy is necessary to progress.\n\nNonetheless the party has taken measures to avoid conservative reactionaries from winning the vote in many of the conservative bastions of our state. Members of the Ulemma, representatives of Sufi orders and local notables with clear religious sympathies have all been stripped from the lists "to put a definitive halt to the decay of the Sublime Porte"."

### Balkan War Intervention
ottkem.60.t:0 "The Grand Vizier Speaks"
ottkem.60.d:0 "Praising the virtue and bravery of the Ottoman soldiers on the frontlines fighting for the honour of the Empire, the Grand Vizier has called upon parliament to provide a unified statement of praise at the address of the Sultan congratulating him with the victories of his troops. Hammering down on the shared duty to the Ottoman state and its Sultan every single one of them shares, he has subsequently requested that Parliament be temporarily dismissed until the war is over and that he be granted full executive powers to guide the nations during these trying times. How can one, he continues, have an issue with the Exalted Sultan and per extension his Council of Ministers during this crisis and how could there be disagreement in a cause so righteous and noble?\n\nAnswered by the ear-shattering applause from his supporters, and the rise of representatives from all across the Empire to outdo the other in singing their praise of the most Exalted of Sultans and his loyal servant, a vote on the proposal was called at once and answered by nigh unanimous support from both sides as members of the opposition fear that rising their voice against a cause so patriotic and so just may paint them as enemies of the State and traitors to our beloved Caliph.\n\nAs word of the parliamentary agreement spread to the streets of Konstaniniyye and the letter of praise is proclaimed to the roaring patriotic crowds gathered in front of the building (some say as part of an organised action by the OHF), tears spontaneously spring up in the eyes of the bystanders as the excitement and enthusiasm of the people spreads to both sides of the Bosporus."

Liberal protestors gathered in front of the buildings have called upon the soldiers to cease their actions at once, crying out that the freedom of speech and free press are being silenced by the dictatorship of the Grand Vizier.\n\nA small skirmish between police forces and protestors in front of the HIFs main office was broken up by police batons as 10 bystanders were taken into custody for "unpatriotic actions" and "treason towards the Sultan"."

The action is successful nonetheless, as the popularity of the Hero of Antep and Maras continues to rise with every victory on the field."

ottkem.63.t:0 "Incorporation of Thrace"
ottkem.63.d:0 "The nation stands victorious atop the corpse of the Bulgarian state, successfully wresting back control over its lost territories. Throughout Western Thrace the army is hailed as heroes, and sons of Osman himself, as in Konstantiniyye the triumph of Mustafa Kemal is supreme. From his actions in the Italian-Ottoman war to his valiant defence at Gallipoli to his role in the closing stages of the Weltkrieg, there can be no more doubt of his skill and patriotism.\n\nAlthough not originally envisioning a campaign into the Balkans in his designs for the nation, the re-conquest of the lost sons of Osman has made him nigh untouchable within the Ottoman political sphere. All eyes are on him, Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, now as the opposition tries to garner what support it has to prevent this man from disabling them indefinitely."
ottkem.63.a:0 "His rise was spectacular but it's easy to fall when you're up so high"

ottkem.64.t:0 "Unrest in Thrace"
ottkem.64.d:0 "During the Dark Years of the Empire when its borders were under assault from all sides, massive population displacements occurred in the Balkans, as from one day upon another hundreds of thousands of Muslims found themselves in a nation overtly hostile to their existence. Endless caravans of refugees were forced to leave the former Ottoman territories after its humiliating defeats and tried to find a new home on the edges of the capital from where the Ottoman government tried to resettle them across Anatolia.\n\nMany of these people forced out of their homes in a war they often played no part in have seen in the recent re-conquest of Bulgarian territory to finally return home, and have been encouraged to do so by Konstantiniyye, who desires to deport as many Bulgarians out of her territory as possible. To make room for these people, the government has confiscated vast swathes of land from Bulgarian landowners to distribute amongst its citizens.\n\nNot unsurprisingly, the Bulgarian people living on the land are opposing the government wherever they can, as skirmishes between Muslim Turks and Bulgars are daily occurrences throughout the region. To answer the growing crisis and to restore public order to these new acquisitions of the Empire, the army has requested a mandate to restore order, by force if necessary. Foreign response has been openly negative to the deportations and some more cautious members of our government are requesting us to tone down the scale of the operations to avoid creating the scene for a European intervention, not unlike those seen throughout the 19th Century."
ottkem.64.a:0 "Let's not do anything drastic"
ottkem.64.b:0 "Send in the Army"

ottkem.65.t:0 "The Village Institutes"
ottkem.65.d:0 "As a way to increase the literacy rate of the rural population, the ministry of education has announced the creation of the 'Köy Enstitüleri' or Village Institutes. To combat the lack of schools in most of the Empires villages, this program plans to train teachers so they can pass their knowledge on to their hometowns (or to induce social change in areas hard to reach by the government).\n\nOne of the main foci of these schools is to improve the agricultural efficiency of the countryside and therefore they all possess large cultivable fields with which new farming methods are taught. Other disciplines taught include practical subjects such as fishing, carpentry, construction and theoretical ones such as mathematics, science, literature and history. Furthermore all students are required to read 25 books per year to broaden their horizons and learn to play a music instrument. A highly radical idea launched in these schools furthermore are the weekly meetings in which students can freely criticize their teachers and the school administration.\n\nOpposition to the schools has started almost as soon as they opened as conservatives attack the policy of co-education, whilst anti-socialists oppose the open availability of leftists’ works in the school libraries. Local leaders have uttered their own complaints as they see these highly educated students not only take over education but matters of farming and local industry."

Initially refusing to accept medical treatment, he was finally convinced by his friend Ismet Pasha to bring in a foreign doctor who diagnosed him with cirrhosis. This news, coming as a great shock to the still brittle OHF, is causing great consternation amongst its leadership as the Grand Vizier is seen as the metaphorical glue holding not just the party but the entire country together.\n\nKemal has however urged them not to panic, promising them that his illness is but a minor setback on the long road towards the uplifting of the Ottoman people, and has secluded himself at the Yalova Spa for a week of rest."

Forced to stay within the borders of his villa on the Bosporus, he has been forced to seclude himself even further from the day to day affairs of the government, leaving all tasks to his trusted friend Ismet Pasha. In the meanwhile, official reports of his health have been refused, pushing a narrative to the Ottoman public that the Vizier is only suffering from influenza and will surely be able to resume his position in a few weeks’ time. His official doctor, Nihat Resat, is however less optimistic and has told the leading cadre of the OHF that their grand leader could die at any moment, an opinion supported by imported experts from Austria-Hungary and the German Empire."

# ottkem.68.t:0 "Fragmentation of the OHF"
# ottkem.68.d:0 "With the matter of succession remaining unsolved, caused by Kemal consistent refusal to formally appoint a successor and instead deferring to an election in the Ottoman parliament, various figures within the OHF are trying to establish themselves as the dominant power in the post-Kemal era. Ismet Pasha currently seems the most likely successor, but conflicts within the party between the moderates under Celal Bayar and the hardliners under Recep Peker are splitting the party in two.\n\nTo make matters worse, talks between the moderate flank OHF and the leadership of the disbanded DF have opened, paving the way towards a possible dismantlement of the single-party dictatorship and its replacement by a broad 'democratic' alternative. This alternative, dubbed the 'Endeavour Front' aims to replace the current government of bureaucrats with a broad front of military figures, conservatives, land owners and the Istanbul elite.\n\nCountered by this threat, the hardliners are rallying around the plans of Recep Peker whose ideas (based on populist movements in Europe and America) plan to unify party and state and fully subject the economy to an étatist model, pushing the secular reforms of Kemal to their extreme.\n\nThusfar Ismet Pasha has refrained from openly supporting either side, preferring to walk in the middle of the road and pursue a course of cooperation with both flanks, although his alignment seems thusfar closer to the hardliners than the liberal flank."

ottfev.1.d:0 "In an unprecedented attempt to "stop the spread of misinformation" and ensure only one narrative can take hold, the military has today taken hold of printing presses, radio centres and other channels of communications. With info concerning the attack on the Grand Vizier still severely limited and only dispersed through state bulletins, a wave of uncertainty and paranoia has spread across the empire with many in the urban areas amassing large supply reserves in fear of possible further instability."

ottfev.2.d:0 "To ensure chaos remains limited as far as possible in the periphery, Ismet Pasha has given the order to recall all Walis to the capital and to be given new marching orders. Benefitting from the occasion however, some have suggested to use this opportunity to replace some of the less loyal governors with military yes-men and to as such increase control of our emergency government.\n\nThe action would likely lead to great discontent amongst the Arabs however who may see this as yet another move of Turkish imperialism in a crisis they have no hand in."

ottfev.3.d:0 "Although the Ottoman military is open to all ethnicities in the Empire, the upper caste of the military establishment has remained almost entirely in Turkish hands, to great discontent of the Arab officers, who see an invisible glass ceiling. Now that parliament has been temporarily dismissed and Arab deputies no longer have a way to express their concerns, some of these officers had hoped to play more important roles in the military administration with so far little success.\n\nWhilst many of these officers are lower rank, some are questioning however whether we should execute a round of promotions amongst the Arab staff to ensure that the Iraqi and Syrian armies remain under our control, pointing out the threat Arab nationalist propaganda may pose on the wavering loyalty of these army corps. Others have suggested that a mere shuffle of officers around our various armies may already be enough to mediate the threat and that by moving many of the less dedicated Arab officers to the Balkan and Caucasian fronts, they will no longer pose an issue."

Doing so in protest to the lack of Arab input into the new direction the state has chosen to pursue, the man has laid down his military position, and has returned to his home in Baghdad. So far it remains unclear whether he will continue his position as 'deputy' of Baghdad or pursue a career in local politics but the ramifications amongst the rest of the Arab officer corps are likely to be immense."

ottfev.5.t:0 "Cult of the Marshal"
ottfev.5.d:0 "Never a man of much public display, the popularity of the Marshal amongst the Turkish troops has increased tremendously lately as his dedication to punish the murderers of their beloved Ghazi has been received exceptionally well. Originating amongst the Konstantiniyye garrison, a soldier’s song honouring the Marshal seems to have spread to most of the Turkish divisions by now and has been received well by the Marshal himself as well.\n\n"Mareşal biz buradayız!" or "Marshal, here we are!", the song is an interesting addition to the military music repository with many of the older songs referring to the lengthy and costly campaigns in Yemen or other tragic events in the military history of the empire."

ottfev.6.d:0 "As a solution to the immunity of sitting representatives and to grant the executive powers necessary to thoroughly remove all possible opposition to the former Grand Vizier, the 'Maintenance of Public Order' law was enforced through imperial decree earlier today. Granting the Marshal nigh unlimited power and completely sidelining parliament for as long the nation remains in crisis (decided by the Marshal), an opportunity has presented itself to the OHF to effectively eradicate all remaining opposition to their designs.\n\nMany desperados, veterans and former members of the CUP have already disappeared off the grid in fear of getting dragged into complicity concerning the plot whilst others have already taken the cowards way out. Kılıç Ali Bey, one of these individuals has reportedly shot himself after gendarmerie broke down the door of his home whilst others such as Kara Kemal have left the capital in a hurry to escape arrest.\n\nMembers of the HIF aren't spared either as a wave of arrests targeting them for possible complicity, even though none of them seem to have any solid connection to the plot, is shaking up the capital. Newspapers not following the party line are shut down, military training exercises cancelled, officers temporarily put on leave and the residence of the Grand Vizier put under close guard 24/7 as paranoia or, as some see it, political opportunism takes hold of the nation."

Chaired by Bald Ali, a former lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman army and former CUP member himself, the list of men associated with the conspiracy keeps growing by the day as the megalomania and paranoia of the military establishment has reached new highs.\n\nTried with a combination of charges ranging from complicity in the assassination, treason to the state, abandonment of duty and more, it seems likely that the trials will be more used as a political play to silence the opposition rather than to punish those responsible for the death of the Pasha."

Only 7 men on the list however were able to be caught by the Gendarmerie as many others departed the country shortly after the failed attempt, or have gone into hiding in the vast hinterlands of Eastern Anatolia. Unfortunately for the Tribunal, this also means that those who were picked up by the Gendarmerie carry the least guilt and although some links to a backroom meeting almost 5 years ago were found, the content of said meeting and whether or not this could be associated with the attempt seems muddy at best."

Benefitting from the occasion however, the Ali has proposed to also target a variety of key members in the HIF leadership whose connection to any sort of plot is hard to prove but who could possibly have accidently cursed the name of the Pasha in the open.

This was further exacerbated by the closing of the ranks within the OHF and the formation of the 'Endeavour Front' between various powerful parties. Furthermore there was strong support of the Ottoman bureaucracy for the Front as they hope that with it, the legacy of the CUP can be carried forwards and their plans executed.

The first matter of the day however is already a very precarious one however as even though the OHF coalition no longer has the majority, we aren't as united of a front as we would have liked to be, and the choice of Grand Vizier is a hotly contested discussion subject amongst the various party leaders. Prince Sabahettin, leader of the largest party (HIF), seems set to take this position with his program of full decentralisation and his bold initiative to reinvent the Ottoman Empire. Shakib Arslan from the Mt Lebanon region seems to be his main opponent with a focus on Islamic solidarity, morality and a return to old. The Druze prince, better known as Amir al-Bayan (Prince of Eloquence) has captivated the minds and hearts of many prominent Arab families and seems to have the support of the religious establishment with some even going so far as having an ear within the palace.\n\nAs these two squabble for the position however, many are turning eyes to the DF whose support during the last liberal coalition was instrumental for its success. The relatively young party, founded by ex-general Kazim Karabekir Pasha, nonetheless has seen its election results explode with every election as the promise of a middle way between the hard-line OHF and the Liberal Entente is finding large support amongst the Turkish middle class whilst the generals personal record can count on the support of many former and present soldiers."

His party, the DF (Democratic Party), has once again seen a significant increase in seats and as the rising star within the Empire, many expect that he will do a bid for the position of Grand Vizier.\n\nArriving through Haydarpasa station on the Eastern side of the Bosporus, the man was escorted directly to Dolmabahçe palace for an audience with Sultan [OTT.GetLeader]. With a program serving as the middle ground between the older and for many aristocratic HIF and the authoritarian OHF, it seems likely that the Sultan will at least seriously consider the man who has in the past already stood close to the palace."

This news was further soured by the testimony of Aintebi citizens who pointed out that the properties were seized by the Ottoman state during the Armenian deportations and never returned, even though their original inhabitants safely found their way home against all odds.\n\nThis unfortunate correlation has had significant repercussions on the Armenian delegates of the HIF, who out of protest have announced their immediate departure from the coalition, taking up their places amongst the independents."

ottlib.7.t:0 "The Abandoned Properties Laws"
ottlib.7.d:0 "As the deportations of Armenians and Greeks increased during the Weltkrieg and the death count started to ramp up, their posessions were usually left behind and confiscated by local Muslims. To deal with the growing amount of abandonned houses and other properties, these were ultimately placed under the regulations of the Abandonned Properties Laws and made posession of the state until the original owner could return and prove his ownership. During the war however, these properties were used as payment and enticement for local Kurds and other muslims for their contribution to the war and the deportations in specific.\n\nAs the war came to an end and many of the Armenians deported along the Homs-Hama-Damascus route returned to Cilicia, the new owners of these properties were evidently less interested in returning these. A commission was sent from Konstantiniyye to solve the issue and peacefully assist in the restitution of these properties but heavy opposition from the local Muslim residents, boosted by the efforts of local CUP leaders such as Taşçızâ de Abdullah, Kethüdazâde Hüseyin Cemil Bey, Mamat Ağazâde Ali Effendi, the Kurd Hacı Osman Agha and Hafız Şahin Effendi, ultimately forced them to withdraw despite the pleas of the Central Service of Armenian Repatriation. The Armenians in question would ultimately be painted as traitors to the Ottoman Empire, enemies of the state and willing collaborators of the Entente occupation in 1918-1919.\n\nThe Armenian deputies never stopped fighting for restitution however and with their hopes invested in the HIF to finally give them back their land, they have seen in the recent sales of Miri land an opportunity to receive a fair compensation for their losses during the war. Many muslims deputies however are firmly opposed to these ideas, with members from the OHF often even going as far as saying that this is their reward for the treachery during the war. This has prompted the Armenian deputies to lose their patience with the coalition as to their inability to take a decisive stance on the issue, has now led to an ultimatum.

The Armenian delegation remains steadfast though and insist on the proper return of their land, still threatening to bail from the coalition if their demands aren't met."

Kazim is very well aware of this position and has been playing hardball with our party in an attempt to secure the position of grand vizier for himself.\n\nWith the mind of the Sultan set on our own Sabahettin however, he is now willing to negotiate a coalition.

The horse Kırat was a character in popular Turkish legend; it was the horse and trusted companion of Köroğlu, a Robin Hood-type hero who championed causes of the common people against the oppressive regime. Demokrat and Demir Kırat were often interchanged by the peasantry.

In traditional Ottoman Parliamentary fashion, the conflict is not so much about the work done by the commission but rather the sectarian background of its chairman. Its chairman, a Christian from the city of Aleppo, has been deemed unacceptable for the task by the delegation from Elazig who demand the position to be filled by a proud Sunni Turk.

Supported by the powerful Sufi orders such as the Naqshbandi, the clique around Shakib Arslan has seen its power in the Ottoman parliament grow tremendously to great concern of the non-Sunni groups. Whilst the presence of religion in politics is not directly a cause for concern as this was also envisioned by Sabahaddin, various minority groups are fearful that Arslan is going to ride a wave of Sunni populism and dismantle the system we have so painstakingly built up."

ottsab.2.d:0 "After the abolition of the Janissary corps in the early 19th century, a variety of military organisations were established to ensure order and stability in the provinces of Rumelia and Anatolia. With the proclamation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, these organisations were combined into the Jandarma (Ottoman Gendarmerie).\n\nServing with distinction in Rumelia after the 1908 revolution and on the battlefields in Anatolia during the Weltkrieg, the by then rebranded Umûm Jandarma Kumandanligi (Gendarmerie General Command) had proven its worth and was drastically expanded to the various Arab and Kurdish provinces. One of the issues this brought with it however, and a general complaint from many non-Turkish citizens, was that the gendarmerie (especially in the higher positions) almost solely recruited from Turkish citizens and as such couldn't be counted as a non-discriminatory organisation.\n\nTo solve this issue, the HIF has tabled a proposition to revise recruitment standards and to utilise more Arab manpower in the corps. This has led to protests from Turkish nationalists who see this loosening of standards as a liability and potential threat to the security of the Arab vilayets should revolts escalate."

Recognising their tremendous success, the corps was massively expanded under the Kemalist regime but retained its close ties to the military which made many in the then opposition believe that as long as the two remained united, the corps couldn't have an unbiased stance. A proposal put forward in 1935, in which their education would be integrated within the War Academy, was just barely refused, but shows once more the intentions of the OHF to create a monopoly on security and defence loyal to their cause.\n\nTo solve this potential threat, the Grand Vizier has proposed the Gendarmerie be detached from the Ministry of War, brought under the Ministry of Interior and their training done separate from the main Ottoman army. Furthermore he also proposes the creation of Academies in Beirut, Baghdad and Aleppo in an attempt to incorporate more Arabs into the corps."

To mediate issues raised by the minorities that these didn't represent their groups to the fullest, each of these provincial levels was accompanied by an administrative council to assist the walis and kaymakams. In practice however this solution would do little as a combination of corruption, incompetence and the reliance of the vilayets on instructions from the capital would lead to a wide array of issues making them mostly ineffective.\n\nIn an attempt to combat the inefficiency and increase the input of regular citizens in the governing of their immediate surroundings, the councils on the Vilayet level will be expanded into full regional parliaments which will serve under the federal government but have the power and ethno-religious diversity required to effectively cater to the issues posed by the vilayet.\n\nFurthermore:\n- The Sanjak level will be abolished to avoid unncessary administrative bloat but may be reinstated in specific vilayets if the Provincial Assembly deems it necessary.\n- The wali or governor will be democratically elected amongst the people of the vilayet and confirmed in his position by the Sultan through Irade.\n- Elections for the Provincial Assembly and the wali will be held every 4 years, in between two federal elections."

Only males 30 years of age or older who paid a sum of 150 piastres in direct yearly taxes and who spoke the Ottomanish language were to be considered for a position, and had to be selected by an electoral commission. This commission was made up of the kaza müdürü, the kadi, the mufti, the imam, kaza scribes, and religious leaders of non-Muslim residents. These would present a list of candidates to the next administrative level which would remove 1/3 of the candidates before moving it further up to the next administrative level which would again remove 1/3. The final list would then be used to select council members who would serve the wali for 2 years before new election were to be held.\n\nThe new system would open elections up to all Ottoman males aged 18 and above with the age of candidacy at 30. Elected members would then directly serve on the provincial assembly. Some of the more progressive parliament members however are requesting that we extend the same rights to women, receiving great opposition from the conservatives who see this as an affront to the Caliph and by extension all of Islam, supported for once in this by their Christian counterparts."

To solve part of these issues and establish a stronger rule over the border provinces, throughout the 19th century multiple requests for the merger of the vilayets into a larger Iraqi unit were refused time upon time to avoid creating a power bloc that could threaten the central government. In 1926 however with the collapse of the British Empire and the re-annexation of Basra & Kuwait, the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad would be united and placed under the discretion of a single wali. Under Yashin Al-Hashimi in 1928, the Mosul wali will furthermore be placed under the command of his Baghdadi colleague, with the Sulaymaniyah region (inhabited by Sunni Kurds) separated.\n\nWith most of Iraq as such brought under a central command structure, many question what is supposed to happen to it now that the Vilayet Law has been revised. Some argue that it should remain a singular bloc to provide a stable frontier against the Persians whilst others believe that due to its relatively large and diverse population, it should be split up into a Sunni and Shiite part both with their own provincial assemblies. The question of the Assyrian people in Basra also remains a sore point, as separating them into a separate entity would please the Assyrians but lead to issues with the large Shiite population."

ottsab.9.d:0 "The civil code we have used since the Tanzimat era or the Mecelle code was first codified in 1877. Based on the Islamic Hanafi legal tradition, the code was the first enforcement of a unified law over all Ottoman citizens who previously according to the Millet system used their own codes.\n\nFor decades this code has remained mostly unchanged, and is in the eyes of many, still an ancient relic of a bygone era. As it is based on Islamic law, many of the reformists have protested against it as they feel that religious law has no place in a modern secular state. Christian and Jewish citizens who previously used their own legal system remain discontent with it as well, and have urged the government to reform if not outright replace the dated code.\n\nFor some however, the issue lies not within the code itself, which is a solid document and perfectly applicable to the (Sunni) Muslim subjects of the empire. They believe the problem is that the non-Muslim subjects are also being tried under it and that instead of enforcing a sharia-based legal system on all citizens, the various communities should be able to govern their own affairs. Therefore they propose to introduce a secular civil code which will deliberately be left abstract so that on the local level, the various Millets can choose to fill in the gaps and govern themselves according to their own traditions and needs.\n\nOthers see in this a catastrophe in the making, as the purpose of the Mecelle in the 19th century was to get rid of the legal complexities and put all citizens under one code of law. They instead propose to introduce a new secular Ottoman civil code which would be used by all citizens - no matter their religion - and which would also make all citizens equal under the law, something that is receiving great support from the benches of the OHF."

When the dust settled in 1921, the British shares in the venture were redistributed amongst Ottoman and German investors with the Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian receiving 20% of the total revenue. Oil was first struck on October 14th 1922 near the city of Kirkuk, giving way to the extensive drilling operations later established throughout the region. As interest for the Black Gold by the Ottoman government increased, the government continued to buy out shares and bring the company under its direct authority. The collapse of the German economy in early 1936 further assisted in this effort as in an attempt to salvage its assets in Germany proper, Deutsche Bank agreed to sell its remaining shares to the Ottoman government. Leaving the company as such solely in Turkish and Dutch hands, a number of new concessions were granted. The struggling economy and the lack of personnel to fully benefit from this occasion however has left these unexploited for now.\n\nNow that the government has decided to abolish its state monopolies, some are wondering whether an exception shouldn't be made for the TPC to avoid an important sector of the Ottoman economy falling in foreign hands. Co-founder of the company, Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian has shown his interest in acquiring further shares in the company but it remains questionable whether he will reinvest his profits in the Ottoman economy, instead moving back to Europe."

ottsab.12.d:0 "With the decentralisation of the empire well underway, a question has arisen as to what should befall the Ottoman army. Turkish decentralists firmly oppose dividing it in smaller parts because they claim it would reduce its striking potential and would complicate affairs in times of war. Furthermore it could lead to different training standards, linguistic difficulties between various regiments and possibly even the creation of a warlord-esque situation should one of the constituents decide that it has had enough of Ottoman rule.\n\nArab decentralists on the other hand complain about the strongly Turkified upper crust of the officer corps, and the inability for Arab soldiers to serve solely in Arab provinces, under Arab commanders. Furthermore they are afraid that should the army remain a centralised affair, the Turks would be able to use it to repress civilian discontent with the government and that a powerful Turkish general, such as Fevzi Pasha, could use this to enforce a military dictatorship and revert the changes made."

ottsab.13.d:0 "The Meclis-i Ayan, or Upper House of the Ottoman Parliament, was created in 1876 as part of the Ottoman constitution and mostly served as a way for the Sultan to influence politics, as the appointment of senators relied heavily on the support granted by the Sultan. This ensured a stable and loyal inner circle that could stop drastic reforms if the need should ever arise. The expansion of the bureaucratic apparatus on the provincial level however, has increased expenditures exponentially which has led many to wonder what even the need is of an Upper House.\n\nTherefore with the approval of the Meclis-i Mebusan earlier today, the Ottoman constitution was revised and the institution abolished. With this royal safeguard gone however, some are starting to have second thoughts and wondering if by doing so they haven't opened up the way towards the abolition of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic."

ottsab.15.d:0 "Whilst many were content with the changes brought to the Vilayet law, some believe that they don't go far enough. Especially in regions inhabited by large groups of minorities, there is a certain desire to have an institution separate from the provincial assemblies that only serves their own minority group. Based on the Millet system for religion, they ask that these are expanded and split up in more groups to better represent the inter-denominational tapestry of our nation. Especially within the Muslim category this has proven problematic as Sunnis, Shiites, Alevi, etc. are all combined under one category without respect to their individual beliefs or languages.\n\nSupport for this expansion however is miniscule at best as outside of the underrepresented groups themselves, few want to grant extra rights to those groups. Especially the question of the Shiites is problematic as since their religion does not recognise the Ottoman Caliph as the supreme head of Islam, they believe that the Shiites have no right to demand further autonomy. Should the Shiites however be willing to recognise this position, then further discussion can be held."

They insist that due to local representation through the provincial assemblies is already guaranteed for all religious groups, the Millets can be dissolved with their previous tasks and responsibilities ported over to these newly created institutions.\n\nSome of the leading figures in the various Millets have agreed with this line of thought, but others still fear that this guarantee isn't enough, and that without the protection of their religious institutions, only (Sunni) Islam will be able express itself openly. On the Greek Islands the situation is seen as less of an issue, although objections to the existence of a secular code in the first place, has led to minor protests throughout the region. The Armenian patriarch has agreed with the idea, but in return demands that the full autonomy of the Armenian community in Armenia proper is guaranteed."

Convinced that there are fifth columns within many of these groups, notably the Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians and Shiites, they are trying to push back against the reforms and bring control back into the hands of the Turks.\n\nInspired by Turkish nationalist thought, they see the plans of the Grand Vizier as a direct threat to the Turkish people and are less than amused by his attempts to restrict their influence on both politics and the various security organisations.\n\nConversing with many ex-generals and shifting around various divisions and officers, trouble seems to be brewing and should the situation escalate it may lead rather soon to a military coup."

Second in line to the throne and hero of the weltkrieg, Osman Fuad Effendi has seemingly also escaped the capital which will likely further complicate the attempted coup.

ottsab.24.t:0 "The Future of Ottomanism"
ottsab.24.d:0 "Ottomanism, or the idea that all citizens identify with a shared Ottoman identity above their regional subgroups such as Turk, Arab, etc., has been one of the most influential ideas within the Empire since the early 19th Century. Far before the Young Turks took control after the constitutional revolution, the Young Ottomans were a group of reformers in the latter half of the 19th century that attempted to foster this identity, seeing in it the solution to the rise of nationalism amongst their subjects.\n\nThe idea in practice however remained mostly unsuccessful as the various Christian groups never accepted it as their own, and pan-Islamism turned out to be a far more effective way to keep the Arabs and Kurds in check. The subsequent loss of massive swathes of Ottoman territory starting in the 1870s further caused great harm to the ideal, as with the losses incurred during the First Balkan War, the Christian group found itself greatly reduced. The idea, at first held highly by the Young Turks, quickly lost prominence as in its place nationalism rose. Greek nationalists, Armenian nationalists, Arab nationalists and even Turkish nationalists all had conflicting opinions on the future of the empire and through their actions the hopes for an Ottoman identity free from religion have been almost completely shattered.\n\nNonetheless, the idea never disappeared and with the Young Turks shifting more and more towards Muslim nationalism, the liberal opposition used it as their counterproposal to an ever stricter policy. With Prince Sabahattin now in charge, the idea has returned to the forefront as his ideas of a heavily decentralised empire want to encourage a unified Ottoman identity above regional identification. Whether this policy is realistic though is far less certain, as many important sociologists have pointed out that the turning point has already been crossed and that a radical change in education policy to account for this identity would run opposite to the idea of a decentralised policy."
ottsab.24.a:0 "Interesting"

ottsab.25.t:0 "The Power of Pan-Islamism"
ottsab.25.d:0 "Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte.\n\nAs the Kaiser saw in the Porte the ultimate ally to weaponise Islam and point it at his rivals, the Germans focused their efforts in the Ottoman Empire on developing and spreading this ideology in the hopes of bringing it to completion when war with the French broke out once more. Unleashing hordes of angry Muslims (German estimates were talking of hundreds of millions of rebels rising in unison), a circle of Orientalist figures close to the Kaiser saw one key figure in this entire plan: the Sultan-Caliph of the Ottoman Empire. Through German influence in Turkish statecraft and the education of its new elite, centred primarily on the armed forces, the Caliph adopted it as his own and used it himself to reign in disloyal elements.\n\nAfter the fall of Abdulhamid II in the 1908 revolution and with the ascendance of a new regime that wished to pursue a more secular path, the Germans did not give up and as the reality of the situation started to sink in, the CUP ultimately started to openly pursue an Islamic ideology. War arrived on the shores of the Dardanelles in 1915 and the call for Jihad was launched shortly after... to little success. The grand romantic scheme of the Kaiser, in which through his puppet Caliph he would be able to unleash an unstoppable tide on his enemies, bore little fruits. The idea wasn't forgotten however, rather doubled down upon, as through the network set up by Von Oppenheim and his associates various schools, forums and teachers were sent out to all corners of the world to awaken a spirit of resistance and solidarity for the Caliph.\n\nThe largest success story of pan-Islamism can be found amongst the Muslim subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the Weltkrieg that would likely have been greatly reduced without the efforts of various Islamist groups. This has brought with it however a large price, as promoting Muslim solidarity makes it hard to secularise the state and limit the influence of the faith on matters of state. Furthermore the Islamist rhetoric has spread to Egypt after the end of the war where in the young nation, it found fertile ground to further develop its ideas and if necessary use them against both Sultan and Kaiser."

Nonetheless a Turkish core with strong loyalties to Islam lives in and around the city which has caused us issues in the past when more liberal ideas reached the table.\n\nA protest action organised by the 'Brothers of Muhammed' to fight the government on their leniency towards secularists and the increase of power enjoyed by the minorities escalated earlier today as a detachment of the Gendarmerie was forced to intervene to protect various Greek and Armenian shops and their assets. Outraged and convinced that the government through this clearly showed that they favour heathens over Muslims, they only became more aggressive. Ultimately the Gendarmerie was forced to open fire, killing 4 and wounding two dozen more. Faced with overpowering firepower, the protest quickly disintegrated, but the event has left a scar for many Muslims in the region that will be hard to heal."

Pan-Islamism, the weapon of both Abdulhamid II and the CUP, now seems to be turning itself against the institutions of power instead of protect them..."

Newspapers published by nationalists and Kemalist veterans are eating their heart out as the drama continues to grow.

The Aghas and Sheikhs, who have been involved in a seemingly eternal civil war between each other, are fighting tooth and nail against the plans of the government to put power into the hands of the urban Kurds. Influenced by the Sufi orders, most notably the Naqshbandi, many of the Sheikhs have steered their tribes into open conflict with Konstantiniyye in an attempt to hold on to their power.\n\nFailed rebellion after failed rebellion, Kurdistan is slowly but surely being 'liberated' from its backwardness although many are questioning whether the cost of human life and the clear opposition of the Kurdish ruling class shouldn't be a sign to leave the region alone."

ottsab.33.t:0 "Declining Social Mobility & Centralisation of Land Ownership"
ottsab.33.d:0 "For most of the history of our empire, land ownership was built on a system of common land which was either owned by the state and then leased to farmers who paid a tax for its use, or owned by a certain tribal federation. Whilst this had the significant disadvantage that those toiling on the fields often had little desire to increase the fertility of the land or put in much effort in general, it ensured that there were ultimately little large landowners. Reforms, started already back in the 19th century in part to encourage a more sedentary lifestyle for the still nomadic tribes, have changed this concept into one where land registration became the order of the day, and where previous common land was in rapid succession claimed by certain individuals and families, as such creating a powerful caste of land owners. Iraq and the Kurdish regions have been hit hardest by this as various tribal figures exchanged their pastoral lifestyle for the bustling cities, claiming all land previously owned by the entire tribe as their own. A massive caste of farmers through these actions became landless almost overnight and with little other choice either moved through the cities, causing trouble for the already stretched amenities of these regions, or remained on the land and became subjects of a modern form of serfdom.\n\nWith a massive push on 'self-initiative', 'decentralisation' and catering to their main electoral base, - the landowners - reforms by the liberal coalition have only aggravated the situation, leading to increased support by the impoverished lower classes for the grand aims of land reform heralded by the OHF and the rising socialist parties in the Empire. Not only is this causing a shift in the political landscape towards a more ostensibly radical point of view, revenues have seen substantial drops as well, due to widespread corruption on the provincial level and the refusal by many groups to pay their share of dues to the treasury in Konstantiniyye."

Furthermore there are talks with the government to offer more Arab courses and subjects in the universities of Damascus and Beirut, but the central ministry for education has thusfar not promised anything. Many Iraqi teachers and notables have furthermore embraced the ideas behind the organisation, but fears of further Syrian dominance in the Mashriq have caused many to prefer creating a similar organisation than unite with Beirut."

They fear not so much for matters like language, religion or customs but rather technical expertise both on a university and lower level. To remedy what they see as a massive shortage, they therefore propose the creation of several federal education institutes to complement the local ones, who are subject to the Provincial Assemblies.\n\nAt these schools, in their writings referred to as Imperial Institutes of Technology, students would be subjected to a secular and science based program supervised by the federal assembly. Furthermore these schools would also offer practical educations for teachers, maintenance crew and even farmers in the hope that these will then distribute their acquired knowledge to the people in their home towns once they return. Much protest from the conservative wing has however been heard surrounding the secular nature of these schools, depicting the institutes as a thinly veiled attempt to indoctrinate its students to then spread the message of heresy to their friends and family."

Furthermore the previous governments have held strongly to the idea that deficit spending should be prevented at all cost and have shown that they would rather protect their own interests than fulfil their duty towards our heritage and the legacy of Islam.\n\nDrafted up by the Arslan cabinet, an ambitious plan has been unfolded today with the support of the Caliph to pump resources into a 'rejuvenation' program to show that the light of Islam hasn't faded and to show the people that it still governs according to the Laws of the Prophet."

Whilst the non-Muslims remain mostly free from this due to their own protected forms of education, all Muslims from Ankara to Medina are now being ensured  that they receive the guidance of this new narrative, which shows direct links between religion and Muslim greatness, shows that Western civilisation has prospered because of their dedication to Christianity and attempts to teach students that service to the Caliph and Islam in general is the highest virtue one can achieve.\n\nNonetheless, Arslan’s ideas do not condemn all forms of modernisation, and they do not refute that which science has proven. He speaks out against imitation of the West but recognises that there are lessons to be learned from them and that virtue and dedication are all that is necessary to propel the entire Islamic civilisation forwards."
ottars.5.a:0 "A grand idea!"

ottars.6.t:0 "The Position of the Şeyhülislam"
ottars.6.d:0 "The role of the Şeyhülislam can best be understood as the Grand Mufti of all muslims within the Ottoman Empire. Residing over the Ulama, he is responsible for the writing of fatwas and ensure order and discipline within the religious hierarchy making him only second to the Caliph himself. Nonetheless his power was greatly hindered during the CUP regime as he was reduced to a tool to dweep the masses and write out the call for Jihad whilst his position on the Imperial Cabinet was taken away and control by the Young Turks over the religious hierarchy sharpened.\n\nMany conservative forces saw these actions as an insult against both the office and the importance of Islam in Ottoman society. Further reductions in power of the office of the Caliph itself further encountered dissapointement, anger and frustration as they see these deeds not as positive for the overall administration of the Empire but an attempt to sacrifice tradition and authenticity for cheap imitation of the West. Many in the Islamist movement, whereunder Arslan himself furthermore believe that religion does still play an important role in Western society and that it is just because of their shared Christian beliefs and their dedication to them that they have been able to outclass the muslims. They believe that the attempts by the West to impose their set of rules on our society are done out of religious reasons and that their sole goal is the ultimate victory of the Cross over the Crescent.\n\nThe cabinet, inspired by Western governmental forms and occupied by those educated along Western standards and knowledge is thus in dire need of spiritual guidance and a system of checks and balances to ensure they can not abolish what is sacred. As the Caliph, for now, is barred by the constitution from directly intervening, the Şeyhülislam works without this framework and should thus be restored to his original pre-CUP position. Church and State should not be seperate as it is their unison that has led to our greatest victories and our renouncement of Islamic values that has led to our demise. No more!"

ottars.7.d:0 "When the Ottoman constitution first went into effect in 1876 as the summum of the Tanzimat reforms, it for the first time in Ottoman history tried to ground the power of the Sultan. Nonetheless the constitution did not account for Sultan Abdulhamid II who after just 2 years used the executive powers he still had according to the document to prorogue parliament and greatly hinder the rights and duties granted by it. In 1908 when the Young Turk revolution was able to dislodge the tyrant from his throne, it was restored in full but these new group of reformers had learned their lesson. The great powers of the Sultan were toned down greatly, his status reduced to that of a constitutional monarch and a parliament formed that would take over almost all forms of government.\n\nThe CUP however soon came to realise that in the great diversity and political chaos of the empire, a strong central figure with tremendous power could be useful to shut down possible opposition. By employing a weak and unambitious monarch for their goals, they reasoned that they would have the executive power of an absolute monarch whilst being able to do as they saw fit. Slowly returning power to the position of the Sultan, their plan worked marvellously for Sultan Mehmet V who was smart enough not to oppose the real ruling figures. They had however not accounted for Vahdettin who with these powers was able to rid himself of the CUP grasp and rule as he saw fit with his allies in the liberal coalition.\n\nThe death of Vahdettin in 1926 and his succession by the more timid Abdulmecid II allowed much of this power to be shackled once more to a parliamentary body but still allowed him the freedom to appoint a Grand Vizier, declare war and serve as the supreme commander of the Ottoman army. The ageing Sultan never saw much reason to use these powers, very well aware of the threat the military establishment poses to his own position if he should but Ahmed IV, heir to the throne, seems to have inherited less of his wisdom and has shown interest in the designs by the conservatives to continually shift power back to the office of the Caliph.\n\nAs Parliament continues to prove an issue in this regard, the conservatives are now pushing for the restoration of the right to prorogue parliament without its permission and as such give the Sultan the power to push through the necessary reforms without parliamentary oversight."

ottars.8.t:0 "Sultan Ahmed IV Prorogues Parliament"
ottars.8.d:0 "At the request of the Grand Vizier, Sultan Ahmed IV has today called for the prorogation of parliament. Frequently used by Abdulhamid II to rid himself of parliamentary interference, this is a worrying step as it is the first clear sign that the Caliph will attempt to take back power in his own hands with the assistance of his Islamist and Royalist support base. Others are however saying that this is an unnecessary worry and that the Sultan has solely taken this decision to better prepare for the elections later this year. Recent changes of leadership within the liberal coalition and the growing foreign threat do give some reasoning for this move but the decision to limit military training exercices and the decision to send some pronounced opposition members to positions abroad does little to hide the true intentions of the Caliph."
ottars.8.a:0 "Most worrying"

ottars.9.t:0 "Handling the Armed Forces"
ottars.9.d:0 "Within the leadership of our grand army, many have been educated by German or French tutors and have as such inherited some of their modern Western values and ideas on a stable society. This brings with it however also the absurd idea that traditions are just there to be discarded, behaviour we will no longer tolerate. This treachery to the Caliph runs deep in the military establishment though and we will have to revise the entire structure from the ground up to ensure that they can no longer prove a threat to the position of the monarchy.\n\nTo block possible opposition from the existing cadre, training exercises have been halted and many of those with ties to the old CUP of the more recent OHF have either been sent abroad or placed under strict scrutiny from our agents. Not all of them seem to be folding as easily though as reports of former CUP members fleeing the capital in the midst of the night have started to trickle in."

ottars.10.t:0 "Dealing with the Emancipation Movement"
ottars.10.d:0 "Originating from the era of the constitutional revolution and expanding massively during the Weltkrieg, Anatolia has seen a growing emancipation movement that demanded changes to the old strict rules of the Sharia enforced laws and greater personal freedom. Under the rule of Vahdettin during the 20's, some of their demands were met as education for females was expanded drastically and more professions were opened up to them. Although not going as far as the OHF would have liked, with universal suffrage and the ability for women to enter politics, these reforms by the Caliph of all people were seen with horror by many conservatives who saw in this nothing but an attack on the values of Islam.\n\nWith power now, be it temporarily, shifted towards the Caliph and with Ahmed IV a lot more amenable to meeting the demands of his conservative support base, the time has come to reverse these policies and ensure that the values professed by the Holy Book are back in place. Furthermore, the decadent media outlets that allow these women to express their opposition to the faith, should be shut down immediately to avoid their message from infecting even more true Muslims."
ottars.10.a:0 "The place of the woman is subservient to that of the man!"

ottars.11.d:0 "Launched by Field Marshal Fevzi Pasha together with the 42nd Ottoman division, the army has today stormed Dolmabahçe Palace and the Sublime Porte to retake control over the government. Sultan Ahmed IV has been put under house arrest as the cabinet of Arslan and many Islamist figures were immediately transferred to an undisclosed military prison where they are sure to be met by a military tribunal.\n\nChaos is taking hold across the vast empire as another regime change, so close to the last one is making every last semblance of political stability in the Porte seem removed. With all media brought under direct control of the military establishment now and several orders to arrest highly placed military officers to remove the possibility of the Islamists to regain control, it seems that the junta led by Fevzi Pasha himself is here to stay."

ottars.12.t:0 "Death of [OTT.GetLeader]"
ottars.12.d:0 "Suffering from a stroke after visiting an orphanage near Bursa, the old Sultan was rushed off to Konstantiniyye for medical assistance. By the time he arrived however, the damage was already done and the wise Caliph had taken his last breath.\n\nA standing symbol of the democratic rule in the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan was one of the last obstacles left for the Pan-Islamist ambition to restore the full power of the Caliph. Although many point out that this was solely because he knew from experience how the army would react to such an authoritarian move, he nonetheless kept extremism at bay with his hands-off approach to governing.\n\nAhmed IV, a younger and less steadfast man, will take over for him and continue to steer the Porte through these turbulent times.

otteco.1.t:0 "The Ottoman Economy in [GetYear]: Aftermath of the Infamous Decade"
otteco.1.d:0 "When the dust settled in 1920 and there finally came an end to almost a decade of non-stop war, the economy of the Ottoman Empire lay in tatters. The manufacturing economy which had seen a slow but steady growth in the CUP-era, was knocked down as the effects of the Armenian Massacres took their toll on the educated middle class. Doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc. all became critical jobs as a continued exodus by Greek-Ottoman citizens in Asia Minor showed how devastating the 'National Economy' plan was to the ravaged nation. In a similar way, the agricultural sector was ruined as the real effects of the war started to sink in. The loss of the Anatolian Turkish population was mindboggling as almost 25% of the pre-war population was gone, leaving behind an abundance of land without the manpower to work it.\n\nNonetheless, the Sublime Porte did not sit idle and plans for a swift recovery were quickly drafted, as the first post-war cabinet made it their number one priority. Railroads, left behind by investors of nations no longer existing, were nationalised. The dreaded OPDA was completely shut down and its monopolies transferred over to the state. The 'National Economy' program became the number 1 priority of the Ottoman government as the horrors of the war, and reliance on an untrustworthy non-Turkish population, left deep scars amongst the ruling elite. A Muslim bourgeoisie had to be groomed to challenge the traditional Christian dominance, the people educated and the empire finally launched into the 20th Century."

Then in 1931, the unthinkable happened, as the Nationalist coalition was decisively brought down by the Liberal Entente who reopened the economy to foreign investment and toned down the Etatist measures, so carefully crafted in the decade before. Nonetheless, the economy kept expanding as industry popped up all across Anatolia and the Levant, financed by an almost never-ending wave of economic prosperity in the German Empire and low import costs for machinery and building materials.\n\nBy the middle of the 30s, the Turkish economy had never seen better days, as a feeling of euphoria and progress could be felt from Beirut to Smyrna. Nonetheless, many have pointed out warning signs on the horizon, as increasing instability on the continent and the stagnation of the German economy will likely bring issues to the Grand Orient as well."

Similar to Berlin, Konstantiniyye is on high alert for any changes to the situation as they watch the economy collapse into the ground. Nonetheless there is far less of a crisis in the Empire than many initially expected, as the protectionist nature of the empire during the 20s has formed the foundation of a structure capable of resisting most shocks on the global market.\n\nTo ensure the fears of the private sector are quelled, and to outline the next Four Year Plan envisioned by the OHFs economic partners, a second Economic Congress is planned to be held in the city of Samsun on the Black Sea (Samsun Iktisat Kongresi). Combining both projects from the private sector and showcasing the advances of the Turkish economy over the last few decades, it not only serves as a way to calm down Ottoman investors, but also as a showcase of the modernising Ottoman nation to the world."

With the Berlin Stock exchange disaster however, many of these companies are on the brink of bankruptcy as such opening up the way for the complete unification of the Ottoman railroad network.\n\nAct 294bn, nicknamed the 'Lightning Bolt' act referencing the way railroads pierce though the inhospitable interior of our nation, plans to in one fell swoop abolish all non government held railway companies and to bring their assets together into the DDY.

Many of these states, such as Dubai, are almost entirely dependent on the pearl fishing industry, and have the European continent as their main markets.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of cheaper Japanese substitutes, the market received its first hit during the 20's but the conflict between this state and the Mitteleuropan bloc ensured a steady demand for the Gulf. Now that this demand has almost overnight evaporated, the entire industry is on the brink of collapse.\n\nWhilst this is of course unfortunate for the Arabs of the region, this catastrophe has forced them closer to the Ottoman state and our internal market. Upon the request of several Sheikhs and Emirs, TPC (Turkish Petroleum Company) has opened talks to discuss the possibility of oil exploration along the coast and to expand its operations in the Gulf."

Leading the charge on this is the well-known Aristotle Onassis, native of Izmir, who has together with other Greek families built up a true shipping imperium on the Aegean coast. As many of these ships sail under flags of other nations it is questionable whether this will have far reaching consequences on the Ottoman economy, but the Ottoman banks have nonetheless decided to grant extensive loans for these take-over operations."

Taking inspiration from the ancient Assyrian empire and a return to the Fertile Crescent of old, he pleads for a nation spreading from the Suez Canal in the South, to the Tarsus mountains in the North, and from Kuwait in the East to Cyprus in the West. Though the survival of a nation consisting of such a massive amount of different ethnicities and religions seems a fairy tale, the man not only follows closely to the Kemalist ideal of a secularist state, but also inspiration from the Syndicalist powers seems apparent as well, with a focus on abolishing feudalism, nationalising vital areas of the economy, mandatory education and universal healthcare.\n\nEven though its popularity amongst the Syrian people seems rather low for now, the governor of Beyrut has ordered his arrest and the man has been imprisoned for treason against the state and instigating revolutionary activities."

This latter group has for the vast majority of its history been separated from nearly all affairs, bar their immediate needs, and has made use of the communal agricultural ground to satisfy their own and the needs of the city dwellers. Benefitting from the almost non-existent authority imposed by the Ottoman Empire, who only did the bare minimum to maintain a semblance of order in the region, this group lived a poor but fairly content life.\n\nAfter the loss of our European holdings and the seemingly shifted loyalty of many Syrian groups, the Empire has received a wake-up call to no longer use Iraq as the poor land it was always regarded as, but to shape in it the future of the Sublime State. Starting from basically a clean slate, schools, roads and a vast administrative network were pumped out of the ground in record time with primary-level school attendance doubling year over year. A 'new' local elite, trained and indoctrinated in the various Turkish academies, was to further extend Ottoman control over the cities whilst the Ottoman Military Academy set up in Baghdad served to create a loyal Iraqi officer corps.\n\nAs the Ottoman control over the cities increased at an explosive rate, this same evolution could however not be seen amongst the much larger population of peasants, still living in nearly the same condition as their ancestors had done for centuries. The Turkish educated elite however, backed by their allies in the Iraqi Walis, discontent with the low agricultural output has over the last 2 decades increasingly privatised and seized this communal land, forcing many of its former residents into a sort of serfdom.

Inside of Kurdistan, great rivalry also rules as the various tribes are involved in a near constant state of internal conflict based on family, language and sectarian lines.\n\nAs the Ottoman state has no desire to let one Kurdish group get stronger than the others or let them find a common ground besides the Padishah, this struggle is often encouraged by authorities in Mosul to detriment of both the Kurds themselves, the remaining Assyrians, and the Turkomans who are often victim of Kurdish offensives."

Raids on Ottoman garrisons, refusal to pay taxes and be conscripted, have caused drastic issues for the few remaining forces in the region.\n\nA military expedition from the coast could restore order to the region, but with the large economic crisis still reigning, many wonder if it wouldn't be best to withdraw all garrisons and grant the region de facto self-rule.

Enraged by this decision, the Sheikh formally disbanded the Majlis, and decided to settle the argument once and for all.\n\nTaking advantage of his son's wedding to Latifa bint Hamdan of Abu Dhabi, Saeeds loyal bedouin who were brought into town for the ceremony drew their swords, and proceeded to kill various high ranking members of the Bani Rashid, amongst whom the chairman of the Majlis. Crumbling apart due to this catastrophe, the remainder of the Reform Movement has fled to the Sheikhdom of Sharjah in the hopes of gaining the support of the Sheikh and returning to oust Sheikh Saeed."

Finding a willing ally in Sheikh Sultan of Sharjah, the new leader of the Reform Movement (Mani bin Rashid) has regained the momentum and tribesmen of Sharjah moved quickly into a sangar on the Dubai side of the Khan creek.\n\nFaced with a fragile support base, Sheikh Saeed of Dubai decided to answer their act with an official declaration of war. Sending his troops within 4 miles of Sharjah, the two camps quickly came to blows. In traditional Bedouin style however, the two sides exchanged inaccurate fire preventing any degree of significant bloodshed. When a truce was signed only a few days later, both sides had run out of ammo leaving 1 Sharjah man killed and 2 Dubai men prisoner.\n\nSince fighting had become impossible due to a lack of material, both sides have for agreed to a 3-month truce to await the next shipment coming in from Iraq."

In fact cattle and camels are in such an emaciated condition that if rain does occur within the next few weeks, it is more than likely that they will be unable to withstand the consequent cold and exposure and will perish.\n\nIn Ras al-Khaimah, rice and sugar have become in such short supply that people have started to boil and squeeze date sacks in order to extract the last drops from them.

ottsep.23.d:0 "Although Hengam Island, just South of the Persian coast, on paper belongs to the Persian state, the island is de facto ruled by Sheikh Ahmed bin Obaid bin Juma (father-in-law to the Sheikh of Dubai). As part of their shift in foreign policy to take a more assertive and anti-Ottoman stance, the government in Teheran has decided to push their luck in the Strait of Hormuz. Earlier this week, the Sheikh and his entourage were expelled from the island, sent packing to their family in Dubai, and a customs post was installed proudly waving the Persian flag.\n\nWhilst a diplomatic objection has been made by our government against the Persian aggression, there have thusfar been no plans to escalate the small border conflict to any further punitive actions. In Dubai however, outrage against this move by Teheran has led many to question the capacity of the Ottoman government to defend the interests of the Gulf and their Sheikh for so easily submitting to Persian ploys."

Further coupled to the pearl trade catastrophe and the weak response of the Sheikh to the decreasing living standards of his population, the island has been rocked by a wave of protests calling for reform and equal representation.\n\nMore disturbing than the Persian overtures however is the increase of radio sets, tuned in to Radio Free Cairo, spreading Arab nationalist propaganda and calling on all Arab people to throw of the Turkish yoke."

Sparking immediate outrage from the entire population of the Trucial Coast, in a rare display of unity for the region, a squadron of the Ottoman fleet was dispatched to the region and anchored just before the coast of the Persian city of Lingah. Sending an ultimatum to the Persian government to immediately release the passengers, who were travelling under the protection of the Sultan-Caliph, escalation ultimately brought forth a salvo from the Ottoman fleet after which the white flag was hoisted on the shore.\n\nWhilst the safe passage of Ottoman subjects in the Persian Gulf has thus been reassured (by force), many are seeing in this yet another sign of a nearing confrontation between the two former enemies. With unrest rising in Palestine and friction on the Kurdish frontier, it may even seem that this confrontation is coming sooner rather than later."

Likely influenced by Egyptian rhetoric, the League of National Action has also embraced a Qawmi or greater Arab identity as opposed to the Syria focused Watani identity of the Damascene elite.

With Muscat however, forming a neutral power between the two rivalling blocs, an acceptable compromise seem to have been reached and for centuries the Sultans of the Muscati thalassocracy have been able to govern the peninsula uncontested.\n\nThe decay of the Muscati state has however not gone unnoticed, and with tensions rising between the two largest powers in the region, the peninsula has found itself a pawn in a dangerous game. The Muscati navy, their lifeblood and pride for centuries, has been entirely wiped out as the industrial behemoths of the seas have outclassed the classical Dhows leaving the defence of the peninsula solely to the goodwill of its neighbours. This goodwill seems to have run out as naval manoeuvres by the Persian fleet around the Strait have led to a similar response from the Caliphate, bringing the two to the brink of war."

### War on the Peninsula
ottfor.1.t:0 "War on the Peninsula"
ottfor.1.d:0 "After the Weltkrieg, and the victory of our Sublime State over the Arab revolt, we reasserted our hold over the tribal hinterlands of the peninsula. The Saudis, having fought against the Porte during the early parts of the war, flipped sides near the end and joined in on the repression of the Hashemites in the Hejaz.\n\nContinuous bickering between our two tributaries over complete control of the peninsula however, never ceased, and ever since the fall of the British Empire in 1925, the Saudis have built up their strength to deliver the deathblow to the Rashidi-dominated Northern federation of emirs.\n\nAs both sides pledge full allegiance to the Caliphate, and our resources are thinly spread and depleted due to years of war, we have little interest to intervene in their conflict. Tribes in Hejaz, Ma'an and the house of Al-Sabah in Kuwait however, are less complacent about the situation and have pledged support to the Rashidis to quell the Wahhabist plague once and for all. Ottoman gendarmerie in the region have warned us of large groups of young Arab men setting off on horseback into the desert, armed to the teeth, and are warning us that we might have issues demobilising these volunteers should they return, and that the flame of Arab independence may continue within these men."

ottfor.2.d:0 "Consisting of the radical core of the volunteer movement that supported the Rashidis in the war for Arab unification, a paramilitary organisation has been founded in Amman under the name of the 'Arab Legion'. Numbering already over 300 men, the organisation has pledged themselves to the protection of the Caliphate, although some have suggested that their real motives are the full independence of the Arab world from Ottoman yoke.\n\nThe army corps stationed in Sam has requested orders to break up the movement by force before they are able to build up a larger support base. The Syrian governor has warned us however that retaliation by force against Arab targets is only going to fuel the risk of revolt and make martyrs of their leaders."

Whilst the Saudis have once more reaffirmed their loyalty to the Caliphate after their victory and have sent us a generous tribute to smoothen the deal, officials in the southern vilayets are sleeping with one eye open afraid of a possible betrayal."

The union of Arab forces against Najd however greatly troubles the governors of the southern vilayets, as they fear that this show of Arab cooperation and the enthusiasm of the volunteers who partook in the fighting may give rise to increased Arab nationalism once more."

Although part of the same alliance as us during the Weltkrieg, there is no love between ours and their government, and we are perfectly aware of their designs on Edirne and Konstantiniyye. The Serbs, for now, haven't invited us to their alliance, but the likelihood of war on our Western frontier is increasing by the day. Preparations are being made to reinforce the fortresses of Edirne, and our troops have been placed on a high alert for any actions by the Bulgarians.

Reminding the population of the humiliating defeat in the city at the end of the First Balkan War, and praising the heroic actions of the Ottoman army during the Second, they now call for the liberation of our Muslim brethren under the Bulgarian yoke.\n\nSmall groups of citizens are already arming themselves in preparation of the coming war as conscription centres are filling up with volunteers to fight for the re*conquest of Western Thrace.

Imams scream for war from atop their minibars, whilst banditry and mob violence against Bulgarian shop keepers and citizens increases as the army mobilises to prepare our defences. The situation is near the breaking point and it seems unlikely at this stage that the Ottoman army will not side with the Balkan Pact to "liberate" our Muslim citizens."

This zone, for whom the great powers that be (and the Ottoman Empire) would be responsible in terms of protection, would be governed as a free state where foreign investors can have free reign (albeit within the limits of the law).\n\nThe second option, preferred by the Ottoman state, is the integration of the Canal Zone into its domain but with various concessions and restrictions granted to foreign nations. So foreign warships would be allowed to pass in peacetime, trade never obstructed (even in wartime) and the Suez company would retain majority shares in the Canal.

With Russian intentions to absorb the Azeri state into their empire, claiming a need for fuel and the restoration of old Russian lands, Turkish and Azeri diplomats have been hard at work to develop a plan wherein Azerbaijan can serve as buffer state between the two empires. This plan, which includes Russian rights to the exploitation of Azeri oil for the duration of the Russo-German war and a lease for 10 years afterwards, has been positively received by the Ottoman government, but has thusfar failed to convince Moscow. With the threat of war rising, further concessions regarding the rights of its Russian population and the Orthodox minority have been proposed, hoping to avoid an open conflict."

Two decades have passed since then and with the Russian Empire restoring its glory of old, hawks in our government have urged us to blow off the deal with the Ottoman Turks by demanding the liberation of Armenia, a demand we are sure they will refuse, and plant the banner of Mother Russia on the ramparts of Constantinople."

To accommodate to the needs of the Muslim population in Greece however, and the Greeks 'left behind' by their government, a new immigration policy has been worked out that grants Greek and Turkish citizens the rights to freely choose their country and receive compensation for any possessions left behind.

OTT_Population_Istanbul_desc:0 "Known for centuries as the melting pot of peoples and civilisations from all across Europe and the Middle East, the shining city of Konstantiniyye is the capital of our proud empire and the seat of power for our Sultan-Caliph. Although predominately inhabited by Turkish people, a significant minority of Greek and Armenian citizens reside in the city profiting from the valuable trade routes passing through.\n\nPolitical opinion is divided within the city walls as the majority of the Turkish populace is widely regarded as in favour of the Centralising reforms, although significant portions of its plethora of ethnic minorities fear for an increasing degree of Turkification, and the loss of their special status. What they all share however is a disdain for the Anatolian peasants toiling away in the hinterland, which has caused a significant rift between the enlightened bourgeoisie of the capital and the hard reality on the ground."

OTT_Population_Edirne:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek, Bulgarian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
OTT_Population_Edirne_desc:0 "Birthplace of Sultan Mehmed II, conqueror of Constantinople, the city of Edirne and its accompanying lands hold a special place in the hearts of the Ottoman people. Serving as a vital fortress during the Balkan wars and as the springboard for Envers rise to power in the 1913 coup, the old capital of the Empire is all what remains of the once prosperous Edirne Elayet and in the eyes of many the last holdout of the Ottoman Empire on the European continent.\n\nIts population holds a diverse array of ethnicities ranging from Turkish to Greek to Bulgarian to even Polish, although the majority still remains Turkish as substantial efforts to push out Bulgarian citizens during much of the early century and the influx of Balkan refugees has greatly diminished the non-Muslim population. Greek hawks further to the West however, have long claimed the region as part of their nation, insinuating that the large Greek minority living there and the historical dominance of the Byzantine Empire over it make for a rightful Greek territory."

OTT_Population_Gallipoli:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
OTT_Population_Gallipoli_desc:0 "Gelibolu Sanjak, also known as Kalipolis and Gallipoli, is a peninsula part of the Edirne Vilayet, most known for its role during the Weltkieg when the region was invaded by a coalition of British, New-Zealander and Australian troops. The Gallipoli Campaign turned out to be a disastrous defeat for the Entente forces, and a heavily needed victory for the Ottomans who, whilst suffering substantial losses, prevented the fall of their capital and the likely surrender of their entire empire. Furthermore, many of those that fought on its beaches would take up high positions within the Ottoman administration, whilst the officers would reach the top of the military apparatus.\n\nDeportations during the war and the ensuing increase in anti-Bulgarian sentiment have led to the Christian populations being removed from the peninsula and replaced by Muslims from the old Balkan parts of the Empire whose loyalty is far more secure."

OTT_Population_Bursa:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
OTT_Population_Bursa_desc:0 "Described by foreign visitors as one of the most prosperous regions of Anatolia, the Bursa or Hüdavendigâr Vilayet is widely known for his agricultural output. Silk is however where it derives its most fame from as the city of Bursa is the heart of Ottoman silk production, derived from silk worms first obtained from French merchants. Recent discoveries in metallurgy have given the region a second boost as the Chromite ore, plentiful in the South of the Vilayet, is in high demand for the war machines of both Germany and France.\n\nMuch like other vilayets close to the Aegean, a close cooperation exists between the Christians living on the coasts of the Sea of Marmara and the Turkish Muslims occupying its highlands. Tensions remain high between the two groups however as the mass deportations and massacres of the Weltkrieg remain all the more vivid in the minds of the severely weakened and exhausted Greek population."

OTT_Population_Sinop:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
OTT_Population_Sinop_desc:0 "Although possessing the fertile ground for a large agricultural output, the Vilayet of Kastamonu is not seen as a rich province. Whilst its population is almost entirely Turkish, there is a small minority of Greeks around the city of Sinop that controls most of the shipping in the city. Overall it's an impoverished but content region, as the people there seem distant from the hectic life in the urban centres of the Aegean, and live with only the bare necessities of life. Little investment was done in the region before the discovery of coal near Zonguldak, which was exploited to its fullest during the Weltkrieg, until bombardments of its harbour forced the Ottomans to halt their coal transports.\n\nThe loyalty of the people to the reforming Ottoman nation stands strong, as the small urban population of the Vilayet has shown their support for Kemal’s reforms, whilst the much larger rural population has shown no real desire to get entangled in politics and refrains from forming any real opposition."

OTT_Population_Izmir:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Greek\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Orthodox Christian"
OTT_Population_Izmir_desc:0 "Constituting of the city of Izmir or Smyrna as it is known to the Greeks, the Aidin Vilayet is ethnically the most divisive Vilayet in Turkish Anatolia. As it stretches deep into the mainland, Greek citizens of the coastline and abroad have long complained about the arbitrary census reports that according to them are designed in such a way to drown out the Greek minority of the coastline. They argue that if we look at the entire Vilayet, the population is predominately Muslim and Turkish, although this neglects the importance of the Greek population which represents the majority of the Vilayets economic power.\n\nNot only ethnically, but also politically, the population is divided, as Muslim inhabitants have shown their desire for continued centralisation in the hopes of encouraging social promotion of the comparatively poorer Muslim population. Greek citizens on the other hand are conflicted as they agree with the OHFs progressive stance on religion and legal affairs, but fear that continued centralisation could lead to the abolition of the Millet system and increased Turkification."

OTT_Population_Mugla:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
OTT_Population_Mugla_desc:0 "Relatively sparsely populated and disconnected from the rest of Anatolia due to the lack of an expansive railway and road network, this small Sandjak does not boast the impressive economic power of the Aidin Vilayet, but has nonetheless made a name for itself in the agricultural and mining sectors. Centred around Marmaris, the region is known for its honey production and extensive beekeeping culture, whilst the Southern districts mainly profit from the cultivation of citrus products. Mining also has a presence in the Sandjak as the city of Mugla is one of the Empire most renowned centres of Marble, and the Chromite extraction is steadily growing in Fethiye.\n\nPolitically the region supports the Kemalist agenda, especially their interventionist economic policies, in the hopes that heavy-handed state development can further develop the still fairly backwards region."

OTT_Population_Afyon:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
OTT_Population_Afyon_desc:0 "Tucked away in the Anatolian highlands, the region of Afyon is one the richest parts of the Ottoman Empire, deriving its economic power and fame from the Marble extraction which sires famous landmarks across the world from the Haghia Sophia to St. Peter’s Basilica. Furthermore, it is one of the most productive agricultural regions of the Empire, and is famed for its cultivation of Opium, from where the name Afyon is derived.\n\nIt is a content and prospering region, with recent importance of its mineral reserves putting it on the forefront of state development. The people, almost entirely Muslims of Turkish ethnicity, don't have much interaction with the various ethnic groups of the empire, and have thus been mostly spared from the conflict between these groups. Supporting the OHF in parliament, the deputies of the region are seen as loyal to the party and form no real opposition to the centralising reforms."

OTT_Population_Konya:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
OTT_Population_Konya_desc:0 "Serving as a centre of agriculture for the Turkish population, the Konya Vilayet is not a rich one, as any forms of real industry remain absent from the region. The population, although Muslim in religion, consists of a wide variety of ethnicities as it was settled by Circassians, Albanians and other European Muslims after those were driven from their lands. They are a distrustful people, deeply loyal to the Ottoman Empire that took them in but weary of the influence non-Muslims hold within the empire, especially the Greek minority which is mostly centred around the city of Konya and the Antalya coastline."

OTT_Population_Ankara:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!"
OTT_Population_Ankara_desc:0 "One of the poorest regions of the empire, the central Vilayet of Ankara is impoverished, distant from the capital and discontent with the status quo. Although connected by railroad to the capital, it has only led to a decrease in local manufacturing, as merchants and traders now export their raw materials directly instead of promoting local artisanship. Shaken up by the violent deportations and massacres of Armenians and Greeks as well, the middle class of the region further received a hit during the Weltkrieg, driving its already low economic status, literacy and population density have only further down.\n\nAlthough serving as the footmen in the Ottoman army and experiencing massacres at the hand of the Entente invaders during the Weltkrieg, its people remain loyal to the Ottoman state and populist rhetoric by Kemal Pasha promising a strong response to the continued issues, has swung them firmly inside the camp of the OHF, as not only its interventionist agenda speaks to the minds of the people, but many of them served directly under him during the last days of the Weltkrieg and see in him the future of their nation."

OTT_Population_Adana:0 "Majority Culture: §YTurkish§!, Arab (Syrian), Armenian\nMajority Religion: §YSunni Muslim§!, Alawite, Orthodox Christian"
OTT_Population_Adana_desc:0 "Once part of the Cilician Armenia, the Vilayet of Adana was created after the Egyptian forces under Muhammed Ali invaded the Ottoman Empire and marched their armies all the way up the Lebanese coast. As one of the first industrialised regions of the empire, the Vilayet represents a significant portion of the Ottoman industrial base, as its location in the centre of the Turkish and Arab regions, and its connection by railroad and ship prove it to be the perfect location. Unexploited mineral resources furthermore linger in its highlands awaiting further exploitation.\n\nOne cannot deny the severity with which the region was hit during the Weltkrieg as its prosperous Armenian population, responsible for much of the aforementioned industry, evaporated overnight as deportations and massacres culled the majority of them. As the war approached its end however, and the likelihood of an Entente victory decreased, some of the thousands that were forced to leave all their belongings behind were allowed to return to the region seeing their properties confiscated and their rights stripped.

Just as in the other Christian regions of the empire though, the deportations and massacres struck deep as the Pontic Greeks were targeted by the plans of Talaat Pasha. Contrary to the Armenian population however, the majority of the Greek population survived the massacres, and although refugees have been fleeing the region ever since the start of the Weltkrieg, the recent improvements in Greek-Ottoman relations and the flourishing economy have ensured a slow recovery of the pre-war Greek population.\n\nTensions remain high between the Muslim majority and the Greek minority as the latter’s political status and wealth is met with jealousy from the poor Turkish inland sandjaks. This tension is also reflected in Konstantiniyye, as the Greeks flock to the banner of the OPAD in the hopes that their decentralisation program will protect them in the future. The Turkish majority however, has found solace in the rhetoric of Mustafa Kemal, who promises a stronger Turkish people and state directed programs to assist the impoverished Turks."

Reprisals by Russo-Armenian troops before the 1917 revolution made matters even worse as the already exhausted population suffered another hit, now to its Sunni population. As the end of the Weltkrieg arrived for the Lazi people, their lands have been ravaged by war and constant migration. Their economy, based on agriculture (mainly the export of hazelnuts) and the exploitation of the Zinc mines, has not aged well either as many have permanently left the region in search of better lands.\n\nThe Lazi people share many similarities with the Georgian people further up North, and although the difference in religion between Christian Georgia and Muslim Lazistan have thus far led to little cooperation between the two regions, Georgian spies have been caught in the region who have supposedly been attempting to gather support for an anti-Ottoman insurrection.

Previously mostly inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, the hinterland of the Vilayet received almost no attention from the Ottoman government, and as such its population was almost entirely apolitical, only appearing on the radar of the government when they lynched missionaries sent to convert the Shi'ite population.

With the collapse of the Entente and the need for a peace settlement in the Middle East, the Ottoman government was forced to sign the Basra Accords. The Assyrian people had lived for millennia on the plains of Nineveh, and had come under substantial fire during the Weltkrieg, when deportations and exterminations aimed at the Armenian population started to spread to the Assyrians. Resisting for as much as they could, and joining the war on the side of the Entente, they were no match for the Ottoman military. Fleeing with tens of thousands to Lake Urmia in Persia, they were forced to leave a second time as Simqi the Kurd ordered his troops to slay thousands of refugees. As a final resort, the British government ultimately decided to resettle the Assyrian people in the Vilayet of Basra as far away as possible from Anatolia.

The Awlad Muhammad state was a trading state, and emerged as a station for organizing and protecting trade caravans. Fezzan provided this state with the largest market in the Sahara trade between Bilad al-Sudan, the Maghrib, and Egypt. This wealth naturally lured the administration in Tripoli to take over the trade. Awlad Muhammad sultans resisted the Ottomans; whenever defeated, they would withdraw into Lake Chad's region to recruit soldiers, especially their allies the rulers of Katsina, and return when the Ottoman army had left Fezzan. Faced with a military expedition from Tripoli, the state would however finally fold in 1812.\n\nWhen the Trans-Saharan trade collapsed in the late 19th century due to war in Chad, Fezzan became an afterthought and despite some attempts to establish more control, these wouldn't last. The Italians would experience the difficulties of the Ottoman and Qaramanli States when they were soundly defeated by a coalition of Senussi associated tribes, a defeat that would ultimately lead to the Italian catastrophe of 1915. With the departure of Italian forces and the return of Tripolitanian control, the region remained fairly untouched.

The introduction of cotton around that time gave the city a new lease on life as an export city, but the opening of the Suez canal to European trade forever ended Aleppo's dominance in the cotton trade with Europe.

The Greek community was allowed to retain various privileges however, as under the Millet system, they were responsible for their own religious duties, education and the development of Greek culture.

The decision was ultimately reverted in 1870 when it became independent once more. The Ottoman-Russian war brought further changes to the island as in a secret agreement with Britain, control over Cyprus was handed to the British (albeit within the Ottoman framework). The many Cypriots who expected this to be a definitive turn towards democracy and self-government were badly disappointed however, as all power was to be held by London with very little representation of the Cypriots in their own affairs.\n\nThe independence of Greece played another important role in the history of Cyprus, as with it the calls for Enosis or Unification with Greece intensified, soon engulfing the entire island.

OTT_Population_Haifa_desc:0 "Home to the largest port of Palestine, the Sandjak of Haifa was created in the wake of the Weltkrieg, as the loss of Jerusalem to an international mandate necessitated the reorganisation of the Syrian administration. With the situation in Mt Lebanon fickle after the devastating famine tore through the region, it was thus decided that a new Sandjak would be created with it capital at Haifa and placed underneath the Vilayet of Suriye.\n\nDespite the separation from the Southern half of Palestine, the region remains in close contact with Jerusalem as little border control exists between the two regions. This has also given rise to a substantial anti-Zionist movement, covertly backed by the Ottoman government, aimed at the restoration of Palestine and the reunification of the region. Despite tacit Ottoman support for the cause, the Porte was unable to stop the rise of Arab nationalist thought and while the primary aim of the movement remains an end to foreign meddling in Palestine, it now also includes the Ottoman Empire under these."

OTT_Population_Tripolitania_desc:0 "Tripolitania is one of the three parts of Libya, with the others being Cyrenaica in the west and Fezzan in the south. It got its name from the three ancient Phoenician cities that formed a three-city alliance in what is now the lands around the city of the same name, Tripolis. Between the green lands on the coast and the desert to the south lie the Nafusa mountains, inhabited by Berbers. After it became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, the region, being on the frontier of the Empire and far away from Constantinople, gained an autonomy bordering on self-rule. The Pasha of Tripolis and his captains made a name for themselves as fearsome pirates in the Mediterranean until the western powers of France and the United States of America destroyed both fleet and city of Tripolis at the turn of the 19th century. During the Tanzimat reform period now hundred years ago, Tripolitania was one of the first vilayets to the be formed, in 1864. Since the 1880s, it has seen a strong influence by the Senussi Order that operates from Kufra, further undermining the rule of the Sublime Porte, and in 1912 Tripolitania, together with the rest of Libya, was lost in the war against Italy. The land was returned after the victory in the Weltkrieg, but the upheavals are still felt and the Senussi Order cannot be trusted."

OTT_Population_Benghazi_desc:0 "Founded by Greek settlers in 525BC under the name Euesperides, the city formed part of the Pentapolis or five most important cities in the later Roman province of Cyrenaica. The city steadily developed itself as an important regional centre and would prosper for 600 years, outgrowing the nearby Cyrene and Barca as the chief centre of Cyrenaica. This success story wouldn't last however, as a Jewish revolt in the second century AD and conquest by the Vandals in 431 brought the city crashing back down. By the time Amr ibn al-As conquered the province in 643, the city had dwindled to an insignificant village and became known as Barneeq. After the Ottoman invasion of Libya, the city rose once more in prominence as its strategic location in the Mediterranean made it a key port to control.\n\nAt the advent of the Italian invasion of Libya, Benghazi was nonetheless the most impoverished region in the Empire lacking paved roads, telegraph services and with a harbour too silted to allow much traffic. After 1912, under Italian control, it quickly saw an improvement in its infrastructure however, as the city was deemed a suitable target for Italian settlers, and it served during the Weltkrieg as one of the only parts of Libya still controlled by Italy. The loss in the war however, and the subsequent collapse of the Italian state, led to the return of the city to Ottoman control whom having lost any semblance of authority over the rest of Cyrenaica, developed it primarily as a military base to control the interior and threaten the Egyptian Western flank."

After being disputed by both local Sheikhs and invaders from the Arabian peninsula, Ottoman rule was first established firmly in the mid-nineteenth century, although it retreated once again to Kuwait around the turn of the century. The Porte actually renounced sovereignty over Qatar in 1913 to the United Kingdom, but in 1925 demanded oaths of fealty from the local sheikhdoms, in order to secure the Persian gulf.

Perennially without a permanent ruler, the island was invaded by local leaders from Qatar, the Al-Khalifa tribe, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, and in 1868 the British established a protectorate over the island. In 1892 the British centralised rule of their protectorate, and tied it to the government of the British Raj. When the Raj collapsed into civil war in 1926, Ganga Singh abandoned the British protectorates in Arabia, and in order to prevent a Persian invasion Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa swore allegiance to the Sublime Porte. Although still a poor island subsisting mostly on fishing and pearl exports, Bahrain is still a possible flashpoint between Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and should be treated gently as such."

As Ibn Saud looked on with glee, eager to force the Shaykhs under the iron grip of Riyadh, it would be the Ottoman Porte who struck first as Admiral Rauf Pasha on the orders of the central government steamed to Abu Dhabi with two destroyers and met with its Sheikh to discuss the future of the Gulf states. Reluctantly agreeing that a protectorate under the Porte was better for the autonomy of Abu Dhabi than incorporation into the Saudi state, the Shaykh signed. The Shaykhs of Dubai, Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah followed suit, each signing individually and receiving full recognition of their authority from the Porte.\n\nMore than ten years have passed since the transfer of power, and under protection of the Porte, the various Shaykhdoms endured. Nonetheless, they have had their share of misfortune as the steady decline of the pearl trade, the primary economic motor of the region, is causing massive social upheaval whilst the Ottoman representatives on the ground have slowly pushed for more and more concessions from the Shaykhs, including the sale of land near Dubai for the construction of an air strip to the disgust of the inland Bedouin. The Shaykhdoms have had their differences internally as well and tensions between Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Ajman have grown the last few years. Furthermore, the Persians have been watching closely, and under their last government taken steps to reduce the influence of the Shaykhs on the other side of the Hormuz Strait, whilst naval maneouvres have started to infringe on sovereign Trucial land to great annoyance of the Ottoman fleet."

The population of the region, once heavily ethnically diverse and divided between Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks, was severely disrupted in the aftermath, as each retreating army would be followed by thousands of refugees of their respective nationality, be it Bulgarian, Greek or Turkish. The diversity remains, however, and in the Tsardom of Bulgaria, Western Thrace was one of the most ethnically diverse, and thus problematic regions.\n\nThough sparsely populated and impoverished, Western Thrace owed a greater weight for the Bulgarian economy than one might consider, thanks to the region's tobacco plantations and their contribution to the treasury."

Conquered by the Ottoman Empire, it grew increasingly Turkish due to immigration thanks to its strategic trade route location, and obtained its current name - from the brigand Kirca Ali, who terrorized the roads in the 18th century and used Kardzhali as his hideaway. By the creation of the principality of Bulgaria, the region was majority Turkish, and remained so even after conquered by force in the Balkan Wars.\n\nKardzhali is a rural region, the only industry present here are processing plants for tobacco plantations from across Bulgaria's Aegean coast. During Bulgarian rule, it was deemed a part of ethnic Bulgaria and thus subjected to heavy Bulgarization - but the Turkish majority remained and can develop freely under restored Ottoman rule."

While the region came under Ottoman rule in the 16th century, the tribe of the Banu Khalids hold the real power in the oases of the gulf coast. In 1872 direct rule was restored and Al-Hasa became part of the Basra vilayet, but this should not hold for long, when in 1913, using the weakness of the Empire, the Saudis annexed the region into their Emirate of Nejd. Since these cowards hid their intentions in the first Arab Revolt, the land was not reclaimed immediately, but now it is again under Ottoman rule. While it does not seem to have to offer much at a first glance, it is the gateway to central Arabia from the gulf, and its numerous date tree farms are said to produce only the finest fruits. Some prospectors believe there to be resources of value below the sands of Al-Hasa, but these are just rumours for now."

During the Durrani wars of the early sixteenth century, the Ottomans invaded the region, although they were soon driven out again. During the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans fought the Entente throughout the western regions of supposedly neutral Iran. Urmia was taken in 1915, and the Turanist project of Enver Pasha seemed to be approaching realisation. However, after the war ended in 1919, the Central Powers were forced to leave the region to what remained of the Qajars. Now under Turkish control once more, Western Azerbaijan seems likely to remain a counterbalance to rebellious Armenia, hard to the northwest. Still, full integration will take time."

The administrative central of the former Iranian province is Kermanshah. While it was decently prosperous region for most of history, its economy took a hit when the traditional methods of transportation along the silk road were replaced by routes on the ocean in the last century.

In the north of Khuzestan however live the Lur, an Iranian people that was forced to give up their nomadic lifestyles recently under Persian rule. Part of the Fertile Crescent, Khuzestan has played an important role in the history of the region since antiquity. The ancient Persian empire had its capital in Khuzestan, in the city of Susa. Susa was destroyed in the Mongol invasions, and since then Shushtar and the commercial port of Ahvaz have taken the place as the most prominent towns of the province. The sea is an important resource for Khuzestan, with Ahvaz being a gateway to inner Persia, and fishing is a major food source. The Ottoman takeover of the province is met with mixed feelings. While the Persian rule was never popular, the new economic competition of the other harbours at the coast is not a cause to celebrate for the people of Khuzestan."

Only a few kilometres inlands from the sea, the roads and routes along the Libyan coast, up to Benghazi in the north, meet with the caravan tracks that lead inwards to Jaghbub and Kufra to the south of the Cyrenaica. The town centre is dominated by the ruins of a castle built by the Fatimids thousand years ago, who used Ajdabiya as their bridgehead into Egypt, which they ultimately conquered in 969. The town itself lying on a flat, rocky plateau with little agriculture, it is the wells and cisternes that keep the town alive and crops growing. While not a stronghold of the Senussi Order like the oasis towns to the south, it still was part of their domain and the local Ottoman officials will have to find a way to win the populace over to the order now upheld by the Sublime Porte."

The land around it is dominated by the desert sands, broken up by sharp rocks of dolomite. Before Ottoman troops forced the Senussi Order to retreat to Kufra, Jaghbub has been the centre of their movement since 1856. When the Order set up their headquarters, still under the leadership of its founder Muhammad as-Senussi, a wall was built around the small town and a Zawiya opened its doors that became an Islamic school of renown.

The first European to set foot there was a German explorer only in 1873. The remoteness of the southern most frontier of the Cyrenaica is what led the Order of Senussi to set up their headquarters in Kufra. The Ottoman Empire had forced these unruly zealots out of Jaghbub in 1895. Now that it is under Ottoman control, much work awaits the local officials. While it is an important waypoint for caravans crossing the Sahara and was the main centre of Senussi thought, being a region of strategical importance for the whole of Libya, order must be restored, and this part of the desert largely remains not yet even mapped."

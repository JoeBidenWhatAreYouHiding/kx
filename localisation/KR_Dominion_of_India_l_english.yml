### Leaders ###
POLITICS_GEORGE_FIFTH_DESC:0 "The years since the Weltkrieg have seen much trouble in the British Raj, with the British Revolution of 1925 being the catalyst for many of the events since, but the loyalty to the King-Emperor George remained steadfast among some of his Indian subjects, particularly those in the north. But one, unsinkable truth for the King-Emperor is that the new Dominion is no Raj- it is but just a shaving of the Jewel of the Crown. No longer does the Crown maintain an iron grip on the subcontinent, but a loose alliance with the north- a truth that does not help the demeanour of the King-Emperor in the slightest, and a truth that sits uncomfortably with the Delhi Government, of whom many members wish to break all ties with the King-Emperor and declare home rule. For now, the King-Emperor still rules, but his power is diminished and his roar is now a soft bark."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DELHI_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_CHAMBER_OF_PRINCES_DESC:0 "The Chamber of Princes was originally established by King-Emperor George V during the Weltkrieg to appease the increasingly unruly Indian nobility. The instability and political violence that followed the British revolution necessitated that, to maintain authority, the unelected Chamber was delegated substantial governmental authority, and eventually reorganized into the proper upper-house of the now bi-cameral Indian legislature. Upon the death of the viceroy of India, the Chamber is responsible for appointing a successor."
POLITICS_GANGA_SINGH_DESC:0 "Ganga Singh, prince of Bikaner, proved a capable military leader during the Weltkrieg, eventually becoming the only Indian member of the British Imperial War Cabinet. Not just a military man however, Singh proved to be an astute politician, gaining a substantial following by advocating sweeping yet gradual reform of India's convoluted political system. In his push for reform however, Singh maintained cordiality with the British administration, and gained the admiration of sympathetic aristocrats. Due to his popularity, Singh's support was crucial for then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, in transforming India from an appendage of the British Empire into an independent Dominion."
POLITICS_RATANJI_DADABHOY_TATA_DESC:0 "Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, son of perhaps India's most famous industrialist, after whom Jehangir is named, fled his native Paris during the Weltkrieg, shortly before Germany captured the city. Upon arrival in Delhi, Jehangir's father fell increasingly ill, and Jehangir assumed control of the Tata business empire. Jehangir personally financed counter-insurgency operations in the wake of the break-up of the Raj, and in the process, became increasingly involved in Dominion politics, eventually being appointed as chief of the Indian national bank."
POLITICS_ATUL_CHANDRA_CHATTERJEE_DESC:0 "Atul Chandra Chatterjee, diplomat and moderate labor activist, served diligently in the British Raj's 'Indian Civil Service'; he was the British High Commissioner to India when the British Revolution struck, and upended India's political system. His efforts were pivotal to the establishment of the Dominion's foreign service, even personally managing most of his nation's diplomats when issues arose. Following Viceroy Ganga Singh's appointment, Chatterjee became even more prominent in India politics, even striking up a friendship with Singh. Chatterjee has been a vocal advocate of state protection of the rights of India's industrial labourers."
POLITICS_SRINIVASA_SASTRI_DESC:0 "Srinivasa Sastri, who founded the Indian Liberal Party after leaving the Indian National Congress, is renowned for negotiating a degree of autonomy for India shortly before the British Revolution. Sastri, though once nearly incarcerated for his association with the Indian Home Rule League, and not opposed to India's recent declaration of a republic, is quite an anglophile; he believes that the institutions established by the British should be maintained."
POLITICS_MINOCHER_MASANI_DESC:0 "Minocher Rustom Masani, a vocal proponent of classical liberalism, split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's drift towards socialism. Masani is a charismatic and good-natured man, who, despite policy disagreements, maintains personal friendships with many political rivals, even those of the Indian National Congress. Minocher similarly enjoys even the most mundane of political decision, often speaking for hours on end on the floor of parliament on the minutia of financial decisions and administrative budgets. Minocher's attention to detail and gregarious nature has won him a large political following."
POLITICS_NARASIMHA_KELKAR_DESC:0 "Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's increasingly socialist stance. Shortly before the disintegration of the British Raj, Kelkar, and other more liberal Congress defectors founded the Swaraj (meaning independence or self-governance) Party to promote parliamentarian democracy in India. Kelkar is not only a man of politics, however; he is an accomplished playwright, and his works have been responsible for igniting increased national identity and political consciousness among the people of India."
POLITICS_BALASAHEB_KHER_DESC:0 "Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, and accomplished lawyer, fled Bombay for Delhi in the chaos that followed the dissolution of the British Raj. Kher rose in political prominence by advocating for the protection of the rights of India's lower castes, and it is from these lower caste's that he draws the greatest support. Kher is known for his compassion for the less fortunate outside politics as well; he is known to personally involve himself in charitable endeavours, and is as likely to be found attending to his political duties, as assisting in the construction of a new orphanage or staffing a soup kitchen."
POLITICS_KANAIYALAL_MUNSHI_DESC:0 "Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi is an acclaimed author in his native Gujarat; his works cover a broad range of topics, including: law, Gujrati culture, and political theory. Though once a member of the Indian National Congress, Munshi bears a disdain for socialism, and abandoned the Congress due to its leftward drift. Munshi believes that to assure liberty for the people of India and safeguard against the encroachment of insidious socialist influence, property rights must be protected, while the estates of India's landed aristocracy must be broken up."
POLITICS_KRISHNA_MENON_DESC:0 "Krishna Menon, often accused of harbouring sympathies for socialism and the Indian National Congress, has nonetheless, become one of India's most prominent political figures. Menon is a masterful manipulator, playing the game of Indian politics much like a grandmaster would play a round of chess. With the death of his political ally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Menon was forced to step out from the shadows, and become the face of the moderate left in India. Menon is as distrustful of the West as of political rivals, fearing any continued association with the remnants of the British Empire could lead India to ruin."
POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_ALI_JINNAH_DESC:0 "Muhammad Ali Jinnah, first entered into politics to promote the interests of India's Muslim minority. Jinnah organised the Lucknow Pact between feuding Muslim and Hindu independence leaders in 1916, and founded the All-India Homerule League during the Weltkrieg to advocate Indian self-determination. Following the Indian National Congress's drift towards socialism, Jinnah split from the congress to form a renewed Homerule League as a formal political party."
POLITICS_SIKANDER_KHAN_DESC:0 "Sikander Hayat Khan, Punjabi aristocratic and statesman, and his Unionist Party, have emerged victorious in India's latest presidential election. Khan began his political career as an ally of leftist Muhammad Jinnah, but drifted further from Jinnah with time. He joined the conservative Unionist Party, which had split from the Jinnah's Home Rule Party over dissatisfaction with Jinnah's leadership, and disagreement with the Party's endorsement of land redistribution; this split between Jinnah and Khan has created a political rift amongst Indian Muslims."
POLITICS_CHHOTU_RAM_DESC:0 "Chhotu Ram, after helping to found the Unionist Party, withdrew from politics to focus on social work. Ram's work led to a marked increase in the standard of living of some of the most destitute people of Punjab, and the name 'Chhotu Ram' was soon on the lips of a great many Indians. Upon his return to politics, Ram set out to reform the Unionist Party, which had evolved from an alliance of Punjabi Jats and Muslims into an organisation for the protection of the rural nobility of northern India."
POLITICS_MALIK_KHIZAR_TIWANA_DESC:0 "Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, upon returning from service in the Weltkrieg, became distraught at the division and political violence which had consumed India. Tiwana took up arms against the marauding socialists loyal to the breakaway government in Bengal. Tiwana committed himself in the fragile peace that followed to bring unity to the Indian sub-continent. He joined the conservative Unionist party based in his native Punjab and quickly rose to its leadership."
POLITICS_CHURCHILL_DESC:0 "Former Lord of the Admiralty and now Governor-General of India, Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, was born 30 November 1874 in Oxfordshire to a wealthy aristocratic family. Joining the British Army in 1895, he saw action in India, the Anglo-Sudan War and the Second Boer War. Gaining fame as a war correspondent he developed a passion for both writing and British patriotism. Returning home he was elected an MP in 1900 and held a respected career in both the Conservative and Liberal parties up until the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Overseeing the catastrophic Gallipoli Campaign he resigned from government as a disgraced First Lord. As the war developed in German favour, Churchill and others became wary of the outcome, fearing the collapse of the Empire he took to advocating a strong British presence in the most lucrative colony, India. Becoming one of the main speakers for the Indian Empire Society, he demanded an authoritative response to calls for Indian independence. Present in Delhi when the Syndicalist revolution in the east broke out and the Princely States in the south emerged he quickly became one of the most vocal supporters of a restored Raj Authority. Now in command of the Dominion, Churchill wishes to reclaim the rest of the subcontinent and bring glory back to what remains of his beloved empire..."

### Events ###
delhi.0.t:0 "Introduction to the Dominion of India"
delhi.0.d:0 "When the Weltkrieg began, no place under the sun of the British empire responded more loyally than India. 'The swords of the martial princes leapt from their scabbards', as one reporter put it. From the trenches of the Western Front to the deserts of Arabia, the troops of the British Raj fought doggedly for its King-Emperor and the glory of battle. However, it was also the expectation of the nascent Indian national movement that their full support for the war effort would in turn translate into political reforms at home, once the war had been concluded. As the Kaiserschlacht concluded, the battles on the Western Front victoriously for the Central Powers, and the campaign in the Middle East turned into a stalemate, Britain and her empire accepted Ludendorff's Peace With Honour in 1921. The defeat did not deter the Indian reform movement, who now loudly demanded Home-Rule to be put in effect. The British response, galvanised by the loss in the Weltkrieg, was draconian. As the British reneged on their promises, the Indian National Congress became further radicalised and sabotage and terror soon became an all too common sight throughout the Raj. When the murder of 41 striking miners in Wales cast the Home Isles into the currents of Revolution, India soon followed suit. Desperately trying to maintain some influence on the sub-continent, the exiled Royalist government in Canada decided to grant India Home-Rule as a Dominion within the Empire under the leadership of Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner. This however did little to calm the resurgent independence movement, and thus when the first elections were held the INC boycotted the ballots. This in turn brought a broad coalition of loyalist parties to power in Delhi which held little legitimacy in Bombay and the Bengal, both centres of nationalist and socialist sentiment. The result was a bloody civil war when the INC declared their own provisional government in Calcutta, soon followed by a cabale of southern nationalist princes united behind the Nizam of Hyderabad. Despite early setbacks, such as an invasion by the Afghans that saw Quetta and Peshawar ceded to Kabul, and defeat in battle, Ganga Singh managed to rally the loyalist forces and defeat the aspirations of both Calcutta and Hyderabad, declaring himself governor-general for life in the process."

delhi.1.t:0 "1936, Delhi's Darkest Hour"
delhi.1.d:0 "The Delhi government is the self-proclaimed legal successor state to the British Raj, yet within its borders different fractions vie for power. The progressive Rajas and bourgeoisie are content with authoritarian dominion status, but radical nationalists and independence activists are still calling for the expulsion of the British. Tensions are running high inside the Red Fort as well as in the nation's central parliament. To the North, the Afghans watch our every move, while the decadent Southern Princes in their so-called 'Federation' plot our downfall. To the East, the Syndicalist scum of the Bharatiya Commune may well succumb to Totalism, posing another huge threat for our nation. Reform is necessary, otherwise, we will be wiped off the face of the planet, and the British will have failed to rule India just like Alexander, the Mughals, and all others that have come before them."
delhi.1.a:0 "Have faith in the Maharaja and the King-Emperor!"

delhi.2.t:0 "Remnants of the Raj"
delhi.2.d:0 "A curious mix of princely states and old British colonial administration, Delhi is governed by the Weltkrieg hero Maharaja Ganga Singh and his government of Raj administrators and north-western native princes.

delhi.3.d:0 "The ousted king of Britain, George V, finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since the Revolution swept through the home isles. As the head of state of the Dominion of India, Delhi, his death will certainly cause trouble among the competing fractions of the former Raj, but for now the Chamber of Princes will head a regency until the coronation of his son, Edward."

The troops of the Dominion have crossed the Durrand Line, retaken the lost North-West Frontier Provinces and the cities of Peshawar and Quetta, and stand poised to threaten Kabul itself. The Afghan state is in complete disarray and her people are reeling in shock. We fully intend to at least take back our former territories, but some of the local 'die-hards,' like Baron Croft and Former Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, are pushing for further punitive measures. They call for the annexation and creation of an official Dominion in Afghanistan with its own Viceroy and Governor-general, before its eventual integration into the 'British Raj.' However, any further military actions would be politically and militarily costly."

delhi.6.t:0 "The Viceroy of Afghanistan"
delhi.6.d:0 "Now that Afghanistan is firmly within our sphere of influence, we must decide who its ruler will be. Henry Page Croft, a military man stationed in Delhi, has garnered support from his fellow officials and men for his actions in leading the British forces to victory against the Afghanis. He believes that the defence of India begins with ensuring a stable, and most importantly, a loyal ruler in Afghanistan. This, according to Croft, means that the only course of action after our initial victories over the Graveyard of Empires is complete and utter subjugation. He has nearly unanimous support in Delhi, and he seems the clear candidate to ensure stability in the unruly realms of Afghanistan."

However, he is still seen as a uniting entity among the disparate ethnic, cultural, and religious groups that make up the subcontinent.

delhi.10.t:0 "Status of the Diarchy"
delhi.10.d:0 "We are faced with an abhorrent number of pressing issues, dormant since the usurpation of Ganga Singh a decade ago. Most urgent is the status of administrative governance which have languished under the ancient relic of the diarchy - dual rule over the provinces shared between the officials of the central government and the domains of the many princely states, bound in subsidiary alliance and vassalage to the head of state. The premier is under great pressure to do away with the archaic system of indirect rule in favour of more efficient and democratic local administration, yet the survival of the Dominion was founded on the loyalty of the north-western princes in a time of great crisis - thus a complete abolition of their privileges might be unwise."
delhi.10.a:0 "Let the maharajs play rulers in peace, their loyalty is certain!"

delhi.11.t:0 "The Indian Economy Act"
delhi.11.d:0 "The Indian economy is falling apart. Archaic trade regulations, corrupt tax collectors and abhorrent lack of foreign investment is driving a sword through the neck of economic progress. Calling for a liberalisation of the thriftiness of our nation, the merchants, business magnates and industrialists of the Indus Valley are calling for reform to sweep the economic currents of the Dominion. The Premier is himself not ill-disposed to these ideas which include a broad range of privatisation, tax reforms, and institution of inflation-controlling measures. However, such a strong dose of liberalism might greatly upset the rural poor that still constitute the majority of the Dominion."

delhi.12.d.liberal:0 "In the wake of the our decision to restructure the landscape of Indian economy, calls have arisen from labour activists throughout the Dominion that our government solidify the rights of both the industrial and agrarian workers. Although the factories spanning from Khyber Pass down to Gujarat are relatively scarce, legislation in favour of the workers might serve to stem the tide of Syndicalist influence seeping into the trade unions. However, the backbone of the Liberal Party is founded on the support of business magnates and wealthy industrialists - a group fundamentally opposed to a strong and emancipated worker's movement. The government will have to take a controversial decision no matter what."
delhi.12.d.swaraj:0 "Following our decision to restructure the landscape of Indian economy, calls have arisen from labour activists throughout the Dominion that our government solidify the rights of both the industrial and agrarian workers. Although the factories spanning from Khyber Pass down to Gujarat are relatively scarce, legislation in favour of the workers might serve to stem the tide of Syndicalist influence seeping into the trade unions. Yet the Swaraj Party is facing a thoroughly hard choice. On one hand, a great deal of electoral support for the party stems from the emancipated middle class who regard worker's rights positively, but another wing garners considerable financial aid and support from the industrialists and bankers of Delhi and Lahore. With the party thus divided, it seems that only the premier himself will have the power to force through a decision."
delhi.12.d.jinnah:0 "Following our decision to restructure the landscape of Indian economy, calls have arisen from labour activists throughout the Dominion that our government solidify the rights of both the industrial and agrarian workers. Although the factories spanning from Khyber Pass down to Gujarat are relatively scarce, legislation in favour of the workers might serve to stem the tide of Syndicalist influence seeping into the trade unions. For Jinnah the course looks clear. Swept into office on the winds of popular affection founded in the lowest levels of society, a refusal to improve the livelihood of the industrial worker will appear as all but traitorous."
delhi.12.d.union:0 "Since the Unionist Party swept into office in the last election a reform of the stagnate Indian economy has been passed and the status of the princely states been determined. However, demands have been presented by leaders of the nascent trade union movement of the north-west - demanding the government legislate in favour of greater worker's rights. Traditional and slightly reactionary in its origin, this is a very controversial demand for the incumbent Unionist cabinet. However, the movement for the betterment of worker's rights is an increasingly powerful organisation within the Dominion. As such a contradictory stance by the government and its landed supporters might risk driving the up and coming trade unionists into the arms of radical Syndicalism."

Kannada and Malayalam troops already openly engage army units loyal to the Hyderabad government whilst the federal apparatus of state in the south has been thrown into absolute disarray. While it risks provoking the Nizam into war with us, and perhaps [BHC.GetNameDef], this could be an opportune time to seize the Bombay Presidency which lies just across our border.

Now, with our new government already having decided on the internal status the Princely remnants, the lingering question of what to do with their armies finally surfaces. Some argue that the Princes retain nominal control over the forces in question while at the same time expanding their ranks in order to keep them up to date with the regular state forces. Others believe it is time to bring the princely troops directly and unequivocally under the control of parliament as equal units to the standard army divisions. At the same time a minority of reactionary maharajas and feudal landowners advocate a maintaining of the status quo, although this approach is highly unpopular."

delhi.200.d:0 "In the late hours of the grand Hindu festival of Diwali - the Festival of Lights - riots broke out in Dehradun. Hundreds upon hundreds of celebrating Indians utilised the gathering to launch spontaneous demonstrations against our governance of the region. Nepali shops were burned and the stationed garrisons came under siege. In the chaos of the flames, the governor of the city panicked and ordered the nervous police troops to open fire on a gathering around the Ghanta Gar, leaving around 50 civilians dead, riddled with bullets. As a result, the underground wing of the Indian National Congress has called strikes throughout Uttarakhand, reaching revolutionary heights in the east. From Delhi, Hyderabad and Calcutta feelings are running high as notables engaged in demagoguery call for Indian intervention in a lawful Indian land. It appears that his majesty, Tribhuvan Shah might better watch out."

delhi.201.t:0 "The Barricades Go Up in Dehradun"
delhi.201.d:0 "Riots against the Nepalese occupiers are breaking out throughout Uttarakhand, with insurgents taking up arms in the city of Dehradun. Caused by the recent massacre committed by the Royal Nepalese Army on Indian protests celebrating the Hindu festival Diwali, these upheavals are proof that King Tribhuvan's claim to the mantle of protector of his Indian subjects is shallow and hollow. However, the protesters are poorly armed and inexperienced, making their stand against the well trained and battle hardened Nepali gurkhas as frightening perspective. Conservatives and liberals stand united in this issue - no more Indians murdered by foreign troops! No longer can the Nepalese oppression and occupation of Uttarakhand be tolerated! Parliament is demanding that the government move to the aid of our endangered countrymen, no matter the cost."

delhi.202.d:0 "In a catastrophic turn of events, the Delhi government has announced its intention to aid the insurgents if our forces continue their repression of the rioters in Dehradun. The hawks within court argue that any concession might endanger the monarchy, however, refusing them outright might spell an even more certain doom on our monarchy's rule in Kathmandu. Today is truly a dark day for Nepal."

delhi.203.t:0 "Uttarakhand Secedes from Nepal"
delhi.203.d:0 "With the withdrawal of our armed forces from Uttarakhand, Indian insurgents and rabble rousers have had a free hand organising themselves, watchfully protected by the bayonets of the Indian army. Consequently, the most prominent agitators have organised a referendum aimed at restoring our southern provinces to Indian suzerainty. After the catastrophe of the Diwali Massacre and subsequent military intervention there seems to be no doubt as to the outcome of such a referendum..."

Today, the provisional government councils in the district of Dehradun has unanimously voted to apply for annexation into our union. Nationalist banners adorn the streets from the Kashmir Valley to the snowy tops of the Vindhya Range and the people amass at great rallies celebrating this great victory over dastardly foreign influence. However, given the invasion of troops loyal to the Calcutta government the people have become divided - a setback certainly to be overcome in the time to come."

Nepalese army formations are deemed completely impotent in the face of such a modern foe and our intelligence detail among the underground local wing of the INC states that plans of open revolt are hatching in the East as well. A partition of the Nepalese occupied territories thus seems all but imminent. It seems that it will come easily with a dose of proletarian intimidation."

Sadly, it seems that we are all but powerless in the face of the prospect of a two-front war."

Late last night, the celebration of the Hindu festival of Diwali turned violent as hundreds upon hundreds of Indians utilised the gathering to launch spontaneous protests against Nepal's occupation of rightful Indian soil. A local police commander lost his nerve and ordered his troops to fire upon one of these demonstrations, leaving 50 civilians dead. Tempers are running high throughout the lowlands, reaching revolutionary heights in Dehradun. Our government should be prepared for any eventuality. After all, do we not claim to represent ALL Indians?"

However, some of the commanders who once owed their loyalty to the Calcutta government are willing to give up their political perversions in order to serve Mother India once more. The issue is a dangerous one, given the unforgiving hatred once shared between our two states, and many of our loyal officers deeply resent serving with former enemies."

delhi.303.t:0 "Integration in the Deccan Princely States"

delhi.306.d:0 "The Bengal was one of the most populous and prosperous of the Raj's many provinces. Heavily industrialised by Indian standards, the Bengal was also one of the first of Britain's Indian possessions to be heavily affected by socialist unrest. When the Raj collapsed, the Bengal proved a willing base of operations for Bose's campaign against Delhi and Hyderabad. In the ten years passing between the civil war and our conquest of the Calcutta Government, the massive industrial complexes of the Bengal have been expanded with help from the Union of Britain and a delicate bureaucracy of socialist administration put in place. Now these industrial behemoths lie in ruins after our troops swept through the province and different proposals have been presented as to how they can be brought back into shape. However, these industries proved a vital part in the social organisation of the Bengal and a rapid restructure might harm our claim to legal rule."

Now, the plantations are suffering under the strains of war and poor administration - resulting in poor production rates and massive dissatisfaction amongst the workers. It is our duty as a new legitimate government to address these issues and secure the support and loyalty of the workers in Assam - and maybe earn a little extra while doing so."

delhi.308.d:0 "One of the Eastern provinces seized by the rebels in Calcutta in the chaotic days of the Raj, Orissa was at the time of the Bolshevik conquest characterised by the large numbers of native princely states. Although these petty rulers never rivalled Hyderabad or Kashmir in power, the Calcutta government was quick to expropriate and prosecute the zamindars and rajas of the province. Quite a few of these royal émigrés sought refuge in Delhi, hoping one day to return to their estates and palaces. With the arrival of our troops in Orissa, that wish has now come true. However, a decade of socialist management has collectivised and divided a great deal of the émigrés' estates with huge amounts of peasants and workers depending on the land to survive. The reactionaries within our state crave vengeance and a forceful return to the way of the 'Ancien Regime' whilst the moderates counsel restraint and compromise."

With the inclusion of the late Madras Republic's territory we now control the largest of these former French possessions, Pondicherry. It has been suggested that we restore some sort of autonomy to the city as a gesture of goodwill to our French allies, although this could be mistaken for tacit approval of foreign colonialism."

delhi.313.d:0 "Burma broke away from the Raj in the chaos of 1925, re-establishing the Konbaung dynasty on the throne in Rangoon. Strikes by oil workers and students resulted in a violent revolution culminating in the proclamation of a leftist republic in 1937, heavily influenced by the Calcutta Government. This influence has also meant that a large number of Syndicalists have sought refuge in Burma, where from they continue to wage a deadly guerrilla war on our military and constabulary in Assam as well as in the Bengal. If we wish to completely crush militant Socialism in South-East Asia, we must eliminate the Burmese support for these fanatics - in effect meaning that we must enforce some sort of regime change in Rangoon. However, how to do this is still debated heavily within the cabinet."

delhi.325.d:0 "After a month of turbulence, the referendum to approve the Home Rule Party's platform for integrating the states of the former Bharatiya Commune is upon the nation. Approval in [DEH.GetNameDef] is split, with opposition having coalesced around the traditionalist Unionist party. Those who favour the platform are far more likely to vote in the Mahatma's new Socialist Party of India, a coalition of politicians from across the former Commune, and who enjoy solid support in Bengal to tip the balance in their favour. The most staunch opposition comes from the princely states in the Northwest, so severe that some are threatening to secede even if the platform is ultimately approved."

delhi.326.d.socialist:0 "After an incredibly close election, the platform to integrate the states of the former Commune has been approved. While it has alarmed many, the Socialist Party has also been elected - mainly due to the overwhelming support for the Mahatma's ideals in the former Commune, but the party earned strong support throughout the entire Ganges region as well. It appears that the nation has moved even further to the left, though the Socialist leaders affirm they will uphold the Lucknow deal and not attempt to turn the nation towards syndicalism."

delhi.327.t:0 "The Platform Fails"

With the legitimate British government fleeing to Canada many believed the issues of colonies were pointless compared to the main issue of retaking the home isles, however the IES has put forward the notion that by securing colonies the resources and manpower will be crucial for the Empire’s restoration. For the past decade the IES has been mainly situated in Delhi where it has also found support amongst pro-British Indian elite who believe that the colonial system can be developed into a more inclusive system whilst still providing stability for the subcontinent. The IES’s leader, Winston Churchill, has worked to improve relations with natives whilst also working with the more authoritarian Indian Defence League who are committed solely to complete British rule. The IES currently remains divided with the moderate reformers wishing to grant more autonomy to Indian subjects whilst the hardlines express their views of British supremacy, Churchill now finds himself stuck in the middle attempting to appease both sides..."

Part of an emerging genre known as \"alternate history\", and concerning the Great War.\n\nThe story takes the perspective of a young British soldier returning from a victorious Gallipoli campaign amid a world radically different from our own. In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic.

delhi.503.d:0 "The Indian Empire Society may claim to be a unified force fighting to defend India’s best interests however for those within the society, it is clear that there exists a major divide amongst its members. One faction is dominated mainly by the native Indian aristocracy and promotes loyalty to the Empire whilst also advocating for moderate reforms aimed at keeping the populace content with the colonial administration. These reformers are mostly members of the Unionist Party and have pushed for further Indian representation in governing positions whilst sometimes showing support for Churchill’s rival Maharaja Ganga Singh.\n\nThe hardline imperialists serve as the opposing faction, most members belonging to the culturally supremacist Indian Defence League, this faction espouses the belief it is the duty of the superior British to save colonials from themselves by enforcing western values upon them. Believing only those who dominate the Caste System to be worthy enough of governing and even then should remain below the British, these members are wealthy merchants, military generals, aristorictic politicians and any remnants of the Raj’s colonial system.

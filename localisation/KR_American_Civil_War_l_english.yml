### Set Up Events - Haywood ###
amcivwar.1.t:0 "President Haywood Escapes to Chicago"
amcivwar.1.d:0 "President Haywood has escaped to Chicago and declared that MacArthur is a traitor to all the people of America. His calls have gained a great deal of support in the Steel Belt, and a number of governors have already announced that they do not recognize the 'illegitimate' authority of the current government. They have closed off their borders to American soldiers, raising a chilling specter of the civil war the country experienced less than a century ago."

amcivwar.2.d:0 "In a fiery speech in New Orleans, Huey Long has spoken about the need to fight both the traitor MacArthur and pretender Haywood.

From Chicago, Haywood's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as have the southern supporters of Huey Long, based in New Orleans, and the Pacific Governors under the leadership of Governor Frank Merriam. All have been given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."

### Set Up Events - Curtis ###

amcivwar.11.t:0 "Huey Long Condemns the Government"
amcivwar.11.d.nothing_is_done:0 "The violence in Pittsburgh was just the spark that was needed for Huey Long to declare on the radio that President Curtis is both a traitor and a conman, intent on selling out the American people to bankers and the syndicalists, and that both he and Haywood must be fought to preserve the American way of life. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Curtis government as legitimate and thus refuse to recognize its authority."
amcivwar.11.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed, and with its failure America has been broken. Huey Long declared on the radio today that the corrupt President Curtis and the tyrannical Haywood both must be stopped for the good of America, and has called for all decent Americans to rise up against them. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Curtis government as legitimate, and while they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognize the government's authority within their borders."
amcivwar.11.d.assassination_long:0 "The assassination attempt against Huey Long has been foiled, and worse, the involvement of the federal government has been made public. This is all the justification the AFP needed. Huey Long today denounced President [USA.GetName] and Bill Haywood both as traitors and tyrants, and has rallied his supporters to defend their way of life against tyranny. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the [USA.GetName] government as legitimate. While they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognize the government's authority within their borders."
amcivwar.11.d.assassination_reed:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Bill Haywood, Huey Long has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as corrupt and beyond redemption. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the [USA.GetName] government as legitimate.

He said it is time for the worker to make a stand. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Haywood, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
amcivwar.12.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed and with its failure, America has been broken. Bill Haywood today announced that the workers of America must take a stand against the governments, and almost immediately a number of northern governors declared their support for him. They say President Curtis and his government have no authority, demanding they surrender to a committee headed by Haywood to oversee the restructuring of the government 'as the founding fathers intended'."
amcivwar.12.d.full_demands:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Huey Long, Haywood has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as puppets of their capitalist masters.

amcivwar.13.d:0 "President Charles Curtis experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either southern populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Bill Haywood. They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until Curtis steps down and a 'reconciliation council' under their chosen leader is put in place to restore order in the nation. In response, President Curtis has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."

In a radio speech, he denounced the president for being in league with the syndicalists of the SPA, and accused him of doing nothing to stop the chaos.

Although the real life William Crowley prefered the church choir, Paul Robeson's musical numbers were jaunty popular tunes. The film has proven to be a smashing success at the box office, beating out an adaptation of Jack London's The Iron Heel at the opening weekend.

Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalization of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial. It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal in the Vanguard counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."

Now the AFL, as a part of the coalition fighting the socialist revolution, has begun to exercise their ideological autonomy. They have chosen to occupy the entire left side of the IWW, and begun to pull in allies. Their debates with the IWW can sometimes leak out into street brawls, and, in two cases, friendly fire. The Vanguards, owing only their allegiance to the revolution, have tried to foster cooperation.

However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed.

Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathize with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives.

Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage.

The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalists, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions.

Desperate times require desperate measures, and one proposal, by William Z. Foster that has caused controversy is the proposal to lower the conscription age to 11.

These men are inclined to close their factories and refineries within the South to comply with orders from the Federal Government. However, they are instead persuaded by Lindbergh to stick up for Huey Long and move their business empires into the American Union State on a few conditions. They ask that Huey Long guarantee some sort of political exception to them in these dire economic times as well as a promise of political office once the war is won. If Long agrees to their demand, it will give them greater influence and many of his supporters will wonder if he plans on betraying his ideals. However, refusing in such a time may prove costly."

Pelley is the leader of an all-white Legionarist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals is unsettlingly enthusiastic. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the fledgling Christian Identity movement, which clashes with his personal distaste for the political ideology of Klansmen and Prohibitionists. How shall we respond?"

In order to raise an army for the American Union State in favour of what they see as a moral war, they have officially combined their beliefs to form the Pelley-Armstrong line. This has swelled the Silver Legion into the tens of thousands of members from all across the country, and reports of their speeches have come in. In inclusion to the strongly anti-Catholic and pro-segregationist rhetoric at these speeches are promises that are said to come from Huey Long in favour of almost extraordinary wages for whites and benefits for veterans after the civil war.

amcivwar.94.d:0 "Fighting along the West Coast between syndicalist sympathizers and security forces has been severe in recent weeks, but dropped off within the last weeks - leading to hopes that the unions out west had finally given up hope of success. These hopes were dashed as a new uprising was revealed, with a number of militias organized by powerful Teamster and Longshoremen unions in Washington and Oregon state and armed through underground efforts. This opens up a new front in the civil war, should the rebels find a way to break out of the mountains."

amcivwar.95.t:0 "Longist Rebels Rise in Kentucky"
amcivwar.95.d:0 "Huey Long always held strong support in the heartland, with states like Kentucky and Indiana only barely swinging elsewhere in the 1936 election.

amcivwar.96.t:0 "Loyalists Rise in Pennsylvania"
amcivwar.96.d:0 "Support for the federal government remains strong even in the syndicalist heartland of Pennsylvania, and this has finally been proven as bands of loyalist militia -- reportedly organized in the city of Philadelphia -- rose up in the hills in the central part of the state, claiming the region once more for federal control. Whether they will achieve that goal and open up a new front in the civil war remains to be seen."
amcivwar.96.a:0 "Hurrah!"

amcivwar.97.d:0 "We are seeing increased activity by [From.GetAdjective] supporters in [Root.GetNameDef], no doubt supported and funded by the [From.GetAdjective] government.

amcivwar.98.t:0 "Resistance Rises in Midwest"
amcivwar.98.d:0 "Support for the democratic proponents in the Pacific government has been strong in the American Midwest, with several protests on the streets frequent - many of whom appear to be placing blame for the civil war squarely on the shoulders of General MacArthur. These protests have recently become more organized, and have culminated in a widespread uprising across Colorado, quietly funded and equipped through underground means. Whether these rebels will succeed in opening up a new front for the civil war remains to be seen."

amcivwar.127.d.austerity:0 "While President [USA.GetLeader] celebrated a recent victory by passing a massive austerity bill meant to rescue the United States economy, one which had exacted a compromise from Huey Long and his supporters in the radical America First Party, the bill had the opposite effect on syndicalists and their leader, Bill Haywood. Today a large number of northern governors have declared the Federal government illegitimate, having abandoned the American worker, and thrown their support behind Bill Haywood.

### Foreign Interventions

amcivwar.150.d:0 "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, and - even worse - the Socialist Party of America has proclaimed a stronghold right off our southern border. A number of the northeastern governors in New England, their states beset by syndicalist militia violence, have formally asked the Canadian government to intervene. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by some of the factions less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken. For New England, at least, that might not be quick enough to save them."
amcivwar.150.d.nocsa:0 "Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south, though it seems as if we are spared the possibility of an American syndicalist uprising.

amcivwar.166.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Proposal"
amcivwar.166.d:0 "We are currently in a ceasefire with [CSA.GetNameDef], but none of us are under the illusion that this is anything more than a respite before the fighting resumes. The [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a proposal: if we join the Entente, they'll fight on our side when the battle resumes. It makes sense, considering that the Canadians fear [CSA.GetNameDef] as much as we do, but some in our government oppose the idea of leashing ourselves to the Entente cause. We will, after all, be locked into their wars in Europe even should we win the civil war now."
amcivwar.166.a:0 "We need their help to win the war"

amcivwar.169.t:0 "[CAL.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Entente"
amcivwar.169.d:0 "Obviously fearing our ultimate victory, the [CAL.GetAdjective] government has cozied up to the Canadians and the British. We will need to fight them all, once the ceasefire is done."
amcivwar.169.a:0 "So be it!"

amcivwar.199.t:0 "Last America Standing"
amcivwar.199.d:0 "It is beginning to dawn upon our citizens that the American civil war is actually over. The scars from the fighting will last for a long time, but it seems as if the feeling has already started to sink in that any chance to change America's destiny further has passed. We are now and forever more [Root.GetNameDef], and the world should know that is so."
amcivwar.199.a:0 "God bless America!"


### Rocky Mountain Ceasefire ###

amcivwar.200.t:0 "A Possible Ceasefire"
amcivwar.200.d:0 "The civil war has ravaged America, and there is a growing discussion within the government regarding approaching [CAL.GetNameDef] for a possible ceasefire. Whether the Pacific rebels would even consider such a thing is unknown, but if it occurred it would give us time to consolidate our hold over the east and for our men to recover. Eventually a reckoning would be necessary, of course, but if we don't attempt this now the war may drag on even longer as a result."
amcivwar.200.a:0 "Let's meet them in Denver"
amcivwar.200.b:0 "No, there's no point in this"

amcivwar.201.t:0 "Ceasefire Talks in Denver"
amcivwar.201.d:0 "With the war between [survivor.GetNameDef] and [CAL.GetNameDef] dragging on, talks have been held between highly-placed officials on both sides regarding a possible ceasefire. This comes at the urging of the [survivor.GetAdjective] government, though it's unknown just how much traction there currently is. We shall see within a couple of days whether anything comes of it."
amcivwar.201.a:0 "An interesting idea?"

amcivwar.202.t:0 "The Proposal"
amcivwar.202.d:0 "After two days of talks, army officials have put together a proposal: any states west of the Mississippi River which are currently occupied by [CAL.GetAdjective] forces would be ceded to [CAL.GetNameDef], with some gaps filled in on the map - though nothing they can't properly supply. The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning. Both sides simply call for hostilities to stop for now, for damage to be assessed, and for the living to take a much-needed breath."
amcivwar.202.a:0 "This will do."
amcivwar.202.b:0 "They're asking for too much!"
ACW_agree_proposal:0 "Agree to the proposal as it stands"

amcivwar.203.t:0 "There Will be no Ceasefire"
amcivwar.203.d:0 "Perhaps it was too much to hope for. Talks between both sides in Denver fell apart without any real agreement, and any hopes for a ceasefire have vanished. The war resumes."

amcivwar.204.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.204.d:0 "Talks with [CAL.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the eastern side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."

amcivwar.205.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.205.d:0 "Talks with [From.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the western side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."
amcivwar.205.a:0 "It's peace for now"

amcivwar.206.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.206.d:0 "Civil war has ravaged America for many months, but today a ceasefire was called in the conflict after a meeting in Denver between officials of [CAL.GetNameDef] and [survivor.GetNameDef] worked out terms. Pacific forces would withdraw to new boundaries west of the agreed-upon border, while [survivor.GetAdjective] forces would withdraw eastward. This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable. Even so, this is a moment of respite for each side to gather their strength and count their dead, and Americans on both sides are celebrating a bit of peace snatched from the jaws of chaos."

amcivwar.212.d:0 "Liberia has been under the economic and effective political dominance of the USA since its foundation as a colony for freed slaves in 1822. This dominance has also helped to protect her from European colonial powers. However, now the USA is in chaos, as rival political factions make a bid for the Presidency.

amcivwar.300.d:0 "In recent days, syndicalist militias have been struggling (and failing) to take control in northeastern states, from New York and New Jersey all the way up to the coasts of Maine. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
amcivwar.300.d.assass:0 "The fallout of Bill Haywood's assassination has been felt throughout the north, but the violence is particularly intense throughout the northeastern states from New Jersey all the way up to the coasts of Maine. Several groups of SPA militia are suggesting they rise up along with the AUS, united or not, and are attempting to seize control of the area. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself.

A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
amcivwar.300.d.peace:0 "While Bill Haywood and the SPA have been trying to rein in their militias across the north, not all are in agreement that the compromise bill went far enough. Indeed, several more radical unions are still calling for strikes, and the northeastern states - from New Jersey all the way up to the coast of Maine - have been particularly hard-hit by militia violence. So far, governors in the region have clamped down on them hard, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself.

amcivwar.310.d:0 "Richard Kirman, Sr. today declared Nevada's allegiance with the Pacific States who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of General MacArthur's government. The governor had been in consultation with the Pacific government since its creation, and in a radio address said he could not stand by and let democracy fail in America without taking a stand. So far, federal forces have withdrawn from army bases in the region without threat of further violence."

amcivwar.311.t:0 "The 30 Day Deadline"
amcivwar.311.d:0 "The 30-day deadline by the federal government to the rebellious states has, so far, gone without any of the state governors changing their minds. The federal government is consolidating its position, but has warned MacArthur to expect further violence and state defections prior to the deadline's end. Most in Washington appear pessimistic that an all-out war can be avoided."
amcivwar.311.a:0 "We shall see"

amcivwar.312.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
amcivwar.312.d:0 "The 30-day deadline issued by the federal government is almost at an end, with none of the sides having stood down. Indeed, it's clear the rebellious states have used the intervening time to raise militias throughout their controlled areas, meaning a civil war will be a difficult fight, indeed."

amcivwar.313.t:0 "Contact with the New York Resistance"
amcivwar.313.d:0 "Though both New York and New Jersey were thought completely lost to Federal forces, it turns out that several large groups of fighters managed to make it out of the urban areas, and have regrouped in the hills of eastern Pennsylvania.

amcivwar.320.d:0 "Violence by syndicalist militia groups expanded to the city of Minneapolis and the surrounding region, with blockades erected on roads and the Minneapolis airport reportedly invaded by several armed groups.

While federal forces are still fighting for control over the city, it's quickly becoming clear that they have the clear advantage, and Governor Gordon Browning made a televised address stating that Tennessee would not fall to radical forces. Already Minutemen are withdrawing from the state, conceding control to the government."

amcivwar.326.d:0 "The battle between syndicalist militia forces in New York City, all the way down south into New Jersey, has ended with the syndicalist forces declaring victory. While they have not extended their control to the rest of New York State, the governor having declared an emergency and blockading bridges leading into the city itself, the most populated areas of both states are now firmly under syndicalist control with barricades already been erected along the southern borders of New Jersey state."

Already the leaders of syndicalist militias are being rounded up and imprisoned, although many have vanished into urban areas with lingering reports of violence still ongoing. Indeed, it will likely take months for the federal government to re-establish firm control over the urban area.

Massive unrest in Buffalo was followed by a militia takeover in Albany, and the governor was forces to stand down before he could send an emergency request to nearby Canadian bases for support. Word has it that battles are still going on throughout the hills in the state between Federal loyalists and SPA militia, so SPA control over the upstate region is far from complete."

amcivwar.617.t:0 "The Vatican offers military aid to Huey Long"
amcivwar.617.d:0 "In a rather surprising gesture of solidarity, the Papal States, under the auspices of the Current Pope, has extended the offer of both weapons and supplies to the Minutemen, even going so far as to send fighting men, many of them formed from the ranks of French and Italian volunteers, to aid the Minutemen in freeing America of corruption and syndicalism. This has come as a shock to the Long administration; it's been well known that America is a largely Protestant with the Catholic population, whilst large as well, mostly residing in the greater area of New England, some of them only living as far south as southern Maryland, all well out of the reach of the American Union State at present. While Huey Long personally would attribute this gesture to traditional Catholic virtues of charity and diligence, as most would, some among the upper echelons of the AUS supporters, particularly the devout protestant Gerald L. K. Smith, despise the notion of Roman Catholic intervention, urging Huey Long to refute any attempt by the Vatican to potentially expand their influence in North America, citing the Cristero Wars in Mexico as an example of the Papacy's "corrosive attempt to uproot the values of the Free World. One can easily dismiss Smith's ravings as unfair and bigoted, the ultimate decision rests with Huey Long."

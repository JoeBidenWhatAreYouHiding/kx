### Set Up Events - Haywood ###
amcivwar.1.t:0 "President Haywood Escapes to Chicago"
amcivwar.1.d:0 "President Haywood has escaped to Chicago and declared that MacArthur is a traitor to all the people of America. His calls have gained a great deal of support in the Steel Belt, and a number of governors have already announced that they do not recognize the 'illegitimate' authority of the current government. They have closed off their borders to American soldiers, raising a chilling specter of the civil war the country experienced less than a century ago."

amcivwar.1001.t:0 "Old Democrats Revolt"
amcivwar.1001.d:0 "William H. Murray has given a speech that he will not stand for leftist tyranny, racial degeneration, and federal corruption that lead to the empowerment of the CSA and the rise of the anti-Klan MacArthur. On behalf of the Old Democrats and all 'fellow true-blooded Americans' he declared a formal revolt for liberty, morality and White protestantism. Throughout the American Southeast the Old Democrat and White League aligned governors and militias are signing a Manifesto in favor of a fully 'Constitutional American Republic' that does not trample the heritage of the American people and fights against socialist immorality. White Leagues are currently attempting to maintain control of the border states that make up this new state before the Federal government, Minutemen and socialists attack."

amcivwar.2.d:0 "In a fiery speech in New Orleans, Huey Long has spoken about the need to fight both the traitor MacArthur and other "anti-American" pretenders such as William H. Murray and the revolutionary socialists. All are tyrants that need to be toppled, and only the AFP, under his guidance, can cleanse America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern and Mid-Western governors whom already form his populist-progressive alliance in Congress and have awaited a chance to empower farmers, all of whom have recognized that they recognize the authority of neither MacArthur nor President Haywood."

amcivwar.3.d:0 "The governors of the Pacific states have declared that MacArthur is an enemy of America alongside other anti-democratic demagogues. They currently have not seceded from the Union, but instead desire the creation of a military force to counter-act MacArthur's Eastern Junta. California Governor Frank Merriam announced at the Sacramento legislature that, if push came to shove, they would see 'proper democracy' restored to the country by force."

amcivwar.3000.t:0 "The Western Command Center Established"
amcivwar.3000.d:0 "Generals Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower are commanding Federal forces in the West and are reporting that it is too dangerous to gain supplies and orders from Washington at this point in time due to the sheer size and forces making up the American Union State, Combined Syndicates of America and Constitutional American Republic. Worse yet the formation of the Pacific States has made the defense of the West even more urgent and the Federal government can not afford to grant even more access to the resources of the West to these various traitors. As such the Western Command Center has been formed under Bradley and Eisenhower to fight the forces that would see them tried for standing by the army and attempting to restore order. However, it is rumored that the WCC may have been partially formed by Bradley and Eisenhower's desire for autonomy from MacArthur while defending the Federal Government. Regardless hopefully this new base of operations will bring the Pacific States to see reason and reconsider their course of action."

Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."

Of course they are pressuring Huey Long to accept the guidelines of the Constitution and existence of Western oligarchs, and elites of both the PSA and AUS are suspicious of one another. Nonetheless, Long has justified his proposals by stating they are constitutional so their ideology is not incompatible with ours. We would need a guarantee of course for a new election right after the war, and some support for Share Our Wealth would be thoughtful as well to calm the AFP at home.

amcivwar.4009.d:0 "Despite the Red Guard and the Minutemen not being exactly on the best terms and indeed even having fought each other in the past the fact that in Congress the AFP and its allies have voted on similar bills as the SPA has lead to some positive communication between the two on the higher levels and now might be the time to us those connections. With us already having to deal with the WCC and the extremely hostile CAR our military staff warns us we are overstretched and a left-wing member of our alliance, Maury Maverick, has offered to go to the CSA and offer a peace treaty, as they directly border the USA and would benefit from working with us. Of course Charles Coughlin, Silver Legion leader William Dudley Pelley and most of all Gerald L.K. Smith is opposed to the plan, claiming it would cause AUS boys to distrust Long and that leftists are our enemy as much as the anti-Share the Wealth CAR and Federalist WCC is."

amcivwar.4010.d:0 "The Longist Coalition that makes up the AUS has sent us a peace offer in the form of Maury Maverick whom claims that not only should the CSA and AUS work together for the sake of survival but that we have more in common than both sides acknowledge. While it is likely Long has only sent this delegation in the hopes of relieving his military's front line when it likely comes to full war between him and the CAR and WCC it is also true that we are not in a much better position thanks to MacArthur being on our east side and the CAR targeting us especially for destruction. Syndicalists are not enthusiastic and the 'Syndicalist-Collectivist' TUUC leader William Z. Foster are denouncing the deal as a pointless concession to 'social capitalism' as the CSA will need to defeat them anyways but the Social Patriots in Congress are pushing for it. We could accept this for a time but it is likely the syndicalist side of Congress will eventually tear down the deal if they have their way."

amcivwar.4011.t:0 "CSA declines!"

amcivwar.4012.t:0 "CSA Accepts!"

amcivwar.4014.d:0 "WIth the Social Patriots losing the internal struggle for power in the Congress, The Radicals within our Congress increasingly oppose the treaty with Long as we appear to be defeating the CAR. As such, they press us to destroy him since there is no compromise that revolutionary socialists can make with a capitalist power competing for the same territory, noting that if we don't attack him first he will inevitably anyways and endanger the future of the revolution. We could use our remaining political power to buy time within the Congress however, albeit no more than a week or two."

The referendum offer would require voting oversight boards to help prevent tampering and that the losing side would be given more autonomy compared to the pre-war period to run their region more in-line with their own beliefs. As most of Congress is a shell in the recently conquered areas, the referendum would use proportional representation to decide the number of appointees in these regions, allowing the victor a chance to enact their agenda. On the other hand, those such as a General DeWitt and Democratic Party leader Charles Martin believe Long is little more than a demagogue and to give him an opportunity to become President after the Civil War Disaster, which they partially lay at his feet, would be immoral.

They say we are to immediately revoke the deal and order the PSA to be absorbed by CAR, which is the only legitimate government. If not, the representatives of the party will vote for a new head of state, whom will represent the beliefs of all true patriots. While technically Murray has sole executive power, his regime has not yet stabilized as too many factions are at play within the recently formed CAR. It is clear that he does not yet have the means to oppose a revolt from a majority of the upper members of the party, and for those ultra-hardliners whom already dislike Murray for marrying a native woman, it is the perfect excuse to remove him. However, while Murray has been made bitter by these betrayals, he has found a kindred spirit in Georgia Senator Richard Russell Jr. Although Russell is a Democrat, he has managed to maneuver his way into a strong political position as the most powerful man in his state, and he promises to continue Murray's vision should Murray choose to give him his approval to be the next leader of the Constitutional American Republic.

Nonetheless, while we will have Murray step down quietly under the claim that it's for health related reasons we nonetheless need a new head of the party. Two main factions have come forward. The first is the National Democrats, an internal faction of the Old Democrats led by Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford that represent the urban centered Old Democrats and claim they can offer heavy industrial support to the war efforts while carrying on the Old Democrat legacy. The second group is the National Democratic White League that makes up the various paramilitaries, societies and other radical organizations supporting the Old Democrats and made up largely of the Klan and its various auxilaries and offshoots. They claim that they can provide the neccessary strength and support needed to win the war, and no-one doubts their desire to bring America under white protestant rule at all costs. Their control of the closest entities we have to intelligence services and manpower makes them a force to be reckoned with, and Klan leader (and de facto most powerful NDWL member) William Joseph Simmons a popular choice for leader with white league representatives pushing for it as we speak. Of course, a third idea has come up within the party to simply support General Patton as the new head of state to carry on the Old Democrat legacy. The choice ultimately comes down to vice-president John E. Rankin to whom the party has made it clear the House would not allow him to take the presidency his position in the ODP gives him the power to be kingmaker while the factions are split."

The referendum offer would require voting oversight boards to help prevent tampering and that the losing side would be given more autonomy compared to the pre-war period to run their region more in-line with their own beliefs. As most of Congress is a shell in the recently conquered areas, the referendum would use proportional representation to decide the number of appointees in these regions, allowing the victor a chance to enact their agenda. On the other hand, those such as a General DeWitt and Democratic Party leader Charles Martin believe Russell is little more than a demagogue and to give him an opportunity to become President after the Civil War Disaster, which they partially lay at his and Bill Murray's feet, would be immoral.

The Social Patriots however support Smedley Butler's efforts to create an organized 'Republican Army' that relies on more traditional leadership and command of our superior numbers and industry to defeat the enemy. The Collectivst-Syndicalists and most radical anarchists oppose both plans for not relying on the revolutionary will of the proletariat, noting that the workers will simply overwhelm the reactionaries and this is more consistant with Marxist princliples, and have put forward a mass mobilization plan that will be lead by Foster-supporter Jack Shulman.

It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies.

Of course, this has caused extremely mixed reactions within the socialist congress. Anarchists are largely supportive but more traditional forces such as the AFL and some of the SPA, such as Earl Browder are squeemish, arguing the workers revolution should protect its female population from danger while the Guild Socialists seem to waffle between the two. The American Workers Party of course is strongly opposed to the presence of female soliders believing revolutionary women are more helpful to the revolution on the homefront. /n/Surprisingly even the Fosterites are nearly split on the issue despite being radical social progressives but criticizing it from a revolutionary perspective, arguing that the lowered birth race rates resulting from female soldiers deaths will give reactionary, capitalist nations a population advantage and therefor contradicts Fosterite Collectivist-Syndicalist thought while others view it as a necessity for full social revolution.

They instead look to the right-wing of our Congress, the AFL and Bellaymist Independent League, for a new path for America to follow that is not as 'extreme' as syndicalism. Sitting between the two is the Browderists, American Workers Party and CIO whom appear to favor a more centralzied syndicalist model albeit in quite different ways. The Social Patriots are already calling for a one-time 'universal' citizen vote to decide remaining congressional seats rather than a purely worker-union one, believing the American people more generally should be given an opportunity to express a different conception of socialism if they desire it. Syndicalists and even moreso Collectivists are disgusted by this suggestion, believing it would just be a chance for social reactionaries to hijack the revolution and would give a chance for the bourgeoisie (petit and otherwise) to override the will of the worker. As their arguing gets louder with everyday they are forcing us to make a decision, although favoring one would likely weaken the other and shoving through a pro-syndicalist stance might turn off potential supporters."

amcivwar.3606.d:0 "The rebellion has been crushed but as much of our Collectivist-influenced military is sympathetic to the revolutionaries they demand amnesty for the surviving ones, especially Foster's right-hand man Eugene Dennis, saying they were simply pushed too far and disrespected by our current political leadership."
amcivwar.3606.a:0 "Fine, give amnesty"
amcivwar.3606.b:0 "I don't think so"

amcivwar.3607.t:0 "Fosterite Coup!"
amcivwar.3607.d:0 "The military has joined forces with the former rebels, with Jack Shullman releasing the supposedly imprisoned TUUC militants, including Eugene Dennis. With the Fosterite military having turned on us it is clear that Foster is in command, causing many of the Social Patriots to either agree to step down or flee the nation."
amcivwar.3607.a:0 "We're finished"

amcivwar.3608.t:0 "Military Demands IWW Support!"
amcivwar.3608.d:0 "The IWW-leaning military has been disturbed by the Social Patriots dominating Congress and have called on a compromise in which we grant greater local power to syndicates and communes so they are not overly influenced by our agenda. Of course this decentralization will weaken us."
amcivwar.3608.a:0 "Agree"
amcivwar.3608.b:0 "Unacceptable"

amcivwar.3609.t:0 "Syndicalist Coup"
amcivwar.3609.d:0 "The IWW military under the direction of Big Bill Haywood has couped Congress and reinstated Haywood with his original executive authority, railing against the Social Patriots for forcing his hand with their undemocratic actions. The Social Patriots have decried this although an attempt by AFL militias to push back failed. We now have a choice of allowing them to stay in Congress so long as they accept our leadership or a purge of the Social Patriots who pushed against our demands. Foster has called for a purge against his rivals but Dorothy Day would prefer amnesty, saying that our democracy is new and misteps and confusion under such circumstances was likely inevitable, and to enact a purge would be to re-enact the capitalist democracies repression."
amcivwar.3609.a:0 "Purge them"
amcivwar.3609.b:0 "Amnesty for loyalism"

amcivwar.3610.t:0 "Social Patriots Cement Power"
amcivwar.3610.d:0 "A Social Patriot faction within Congress has emerged dominant, to the point of the anarchists relying more on their communes and the IWW only serving as a tie breaker in some votes. This is the result of Browder's SPA faction and James Burnham crossing the aisle and aligning themselves with the Social Patriots, passing legislation that undermines left-radicals by making the Red Guard further subserviant to Congress, weakening Haywood's executive powers and further cutting union representatives in favor of geographical representatives which only damages the IWW's hold by allowing non-union members and even the middle-class to more directly influence the elections. Now it appears the Social Patriots run the show and will need to settle their differences when the war is over."
amcivwar.3610.a:0 "Sometimes the underdog can win"

amcivwar.3611.t:0 "Capone Storms Congress"
amcivwar.3611.d:0 "The Decision of President Haywood to send the Mob to deal with the IWW turned out to be a grave mistake. Instead of destroying the protesting unions, Capone managed to rally them to his side, and throughout the week as the situation deteriorated, used his influence to secure every facet of our government for his own means. Today, Capone’s power peaked as his mafioso and IWW allies stormed congress, and Alphonse Capone sent a formal request to William Haywood to resign and appoint Capone as President, or face dire consequences. "

amcivwar.37.d:0 "The revolution must succeed, but the revolution is also for the people. When supporting the revolution and supporting the people are the same, the choice is trivial, but when one must be prioritized over the other, hard choices must be made. The Central Committee has been made aware that the supply situation is critical, and either the people or the army must be undersupplied through the winter."

amcivwar.38.d:0 "To those who are well educated, either formally or through bitter experience, revolutionary thought comes as easily as breathing. However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed. Should we focus on reaching those in our territory, keeping our own morale up, or should we spread our message throughout enemy territory, and sap their will to fight their liberators?"

amcivwar.39.d:0 "As the revolution nears success, the people demand that we deal with the corrupt, capitalist politicians in office before the revolution who now rot in our cells. Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathize with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives. A small, but vocal minority insists that they must be executed for their crimes, like the Romanovs or the Bourbon dynasties of old."

amcivwar.40.d:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that there are spies and saboteurs within our territory working to prevent our glorious liberation of the proletarian masses. Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage. However, others within the Central Committee, including Chairman Haywood, wonder if this is a necessary step and if we would be betraying our ideals. Regardless, a vote was taken. What was decided?"

amcivwar.41.t:0 "Red Terror"
amcivwar.41.d:0 "War is hell. Civil war, even more so. The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalists, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions. Haywood has made an executive decision to supress these reports from the free media. 'If the revolution were to fail because of a few bad apples', says Haywood 'then humanity would collectively suffer for centuries longer'."

Desperate times require desperate measures, and one proposal, by William Z. Foster that has caused controversy is the proposal to lower the conscription age to 11. While this would provide us with the manpower needed to fight the revolution, quite a number of members of the Central Committee have expressed horror at this drastic measure."

### AUS Flavor Events ###

amcivwar.48.t:0 "Pelley pledges allegiance to Long"
amcivwar.48.d:0 "One of the more unusual well-wishers to visit Huey Long is an eccentric but passionate man named William Dudley Pelley. Pelley is the leader of a nativist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion that espouses its own brand of economic, political and cultural populism. However, it is no secret that the club has more exclusionary themes than most of Long's AFP, with Pelley openly espousing anti-Semitic ideas and embracing a form of chauvinism that distrusts elements of society he views as not qualified for full benefits. Furthermore, while he has opposed the ODP for its 'backwards' ideas and opposition to what Pelley believes to be 'true' populism, Christian themes and national unity, many believe the so-called 'ward system' he embraces for poor southern blacks among other groups to be little more than a rehash of Jim Crow-esque policies but with a nicer face to it. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals has long been enthusiastic and the two have collaborated in the past, with AFP and Silver Legion militias joining forces against socialists and, less often for the Silver Legion, the NDWL. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the movement which is likely to anger his parties left-wing given Pelley's fanatical anti-leftism alongside his other ideals, and risks alienating potential Longist supporters while empowering the potential competitor that is the Silver Legion. How shall we respond?"
amcivwar.48.a:0 "More loyalists are always good"
amcivwar.48.b:0 "He will have to make do with what he's got"

amcivwar.50.t:0 "Chief of Staff"
amcivwar.50.d:0 "With the civil war looming, the fact we do not have a chief of staff has prompted concern among various political and military leaders. Thus they met with Huey Long to appoint a Chief of Staff to win this war, with the competition being mainly between three professional officers; Jacob "Smiling Jake" Devers is notably hated by Eisenhower and advocated for a mobilized army, J. Lawton "Lighting Joe" Collins favor a reliance on artillery and "Terrible" Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr, who advocates for advanced combat tactics and tactical planning. The right-wing of the AUS have doubts about each of these strategies and AFP leader Gerald L.K. Smith, with the backing of Charles Coughlin and many Silver Legion commanders, has put forward a more political solution to issue which relies on mass recruitment via populist christian recruitment and militancy, although favoring him will surely push the party right."

amcivwar.61.a:0 "Implement conscription"
amcivwar.61.b:0 "Focus on propaganda instead"

amcivwar.62.t:0 "Recall the China Marines?"
amcivwar.62.d:0 "With the outbreak of the civil war, our garrison in the Legation Cities has been left sitting on their hands in China. Though recalling the division would leave our Chinese concessions relatively unguarded, and our influence in the Cities smaller, many are advising us that it must be done to win the war. Should we recall the division?"

amcivwar.64.t:0 "Hardship of the civil war"
amcivwar.64.d:0 "The civil war is bringing the hardship home. People within a number of loyal cities are starving.

amcivwar.64.a:0 "Relieve Civilian Suffering."
amcivwar.64.b:0 "Support our Troops."

amcivwar.65.t:0 "Martial Law?"
amcivwar.65.d:0 "With the civil war raging a question has come about suspending habeas corpus and enforcing martial law in occupied territories. Those within our General Staff are even divided, as it could create more rebels than it defeats pre-emptivly. It might allow us to keep things under control during the civil war but such a move is naturally controversial. What shall be done?"
amcivwar.65.a:0 "Enforce Martial Law"
amcivwar.65.b:0 "Civil order is better"

amcivwar.66.t:0 "Loyalist Terror"
amcivwar.66.d:0 "During the ongoing civil war, some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress civilian populations suspected of helping our mortal enemies.

amcivwar.68.d:0 "A number of men and women, particularly among religious like the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons, do not wish to engage in war, have objected to fighting in the conflict. We can try to silence them or we can offer them to work in non-military jobs to help the war effort.

amcivwar.68.a:0 "The public will handle them"
amcivwar.68.b:0 "Make them work"

amcivwar.69.t:0 "Double V Campaign"
amcivwar.69.d:0 "As we are fighting the various traitors, leaders of the NAACP have begun to push for what is being called the Double V Campaign, Victory for America and Victory against Racism. Not all African-Americans wish to fight for the radical factions and thus a campaign has begun to fight for America and to help win the civil war as well as to help fight against racism within America."

amcivwar.70.t:0 "Militarize the WASPs?"
amcivwar.70.d:0 "Congress is debating a bill to militarize the Women Air Force Service Pilots(WASPs) in a similar fashion to the WACs and WAVES. This would require the government to provide the expenses for the WASPs similar to the other two organizations instead of having the female pilots themselves pay the expenses. It would not have them fly in combat situations, since that is still the job for the Male pilots. Despite this it is facing quite the pushback from Congress as many regard the WASPs as not as experienced as male pilots and not suited for the job. The question then is what shall congress vote to do?"

However, most of the ODP and NDWL fear giving Ford too much influence, and have put forth New Jersey Klan Grand Dragon Arthur Hornhui Bell as their choice for Chief of Staff. The Old Klan and Black Legion factions in the White Leagues however have their doubts about Bell's idealoglical commitment, and have been aggresively arguing that their own Virgil 'Bert' Effinger is best suited for the job."

amcivwar.900.t:0 "The War Ahead"
amcivwar.900.d:0 "Eisenhower and Bradley have found themselves at the center of one of, if not the, greatest challenge the United States Army has ever faced. Their land they hold is dominated by the massive Rocky Mountains and southwestern deserts, is surrounded on all sides by new-found foes, and is crisscrossed by huge tracts of almost completely undeveloped land. It is obvious to both them and their staff that the odds are not in their favor. With this in mind, Bradley has urgently begun reorganizing the forces under his command to make the most of the poor situation and capitalize on the resources at hand and superior training of his loyal and professional forces. Inititives to bring local law enforcement, park rangers, and anyone even mildly qualified into a central Army command have aleady begun. If the WCC can hold, they will have turned America's darkest day into its finest hour."
amcivwar.900.a:0 "Godspeed"

amcivwar.901.t:0 "Recruitment Efforts"
amcivwar.901.d:0 "One of the few things in the WCCs favor is support from the local populace. Residents of WCC territories have begun mobilizing for the war effort. However, losses on the frontlines mean that even our recruitment of protective service forces will not be enough. Eisenhower will begin drafting a series of plans with local leaders to tap into every possible source of manpower available. However, former American Legion commander Alvin M. Owsley demands that aggressive drafts recruiting essentially every man who can shoot a gun should begin immediately. General George Kenney, who is currently serving as an effective 'voice of the Eastern Command' in MacArthur's place, supports this. Some civilian leaders such as Utah governor Henry H. Blood have caught wind of Owsley's measure are objecting to such radical orders despite the circumstances."

amcivwar.902.t:0 "Recruitment Efforts"
amcivwar.902.d:0 "Since siding with governor Blood, Owlsey has questioned our commitment to the Federal government, and stating that commitment to restoring America at all costs, from both leadership and common man, are required to win this war. Communications from MacArthur in the east indicate his backing of Owsley, but MacArthur presently lacks any meaningful authority over Bradley and the notice arrived too late to influence any decisions."

amcivwar.94.d:0 "Fighting along the West Coast between syndicalist sympathizers and security forces has been severe in recent weeks, but dropped off within the last weeks - leading to hopes that the unions out west had finally given up hope of success. These hopes were dashed as a new uprising was revealed, with a number of militias organized by powerful Teamster and Longshoremen unions in Washington and Oregon state and armed through underground efforts. This opens up a new front in the civil war, should the rebels find a way to break out of the mountains."

amcivwar.95.t:0 "Longist Rebels Rise in Kentucky"
amcivwar.95.d:0 "Huey Long always held strong support in the heartland, with states like Kentucky and Indiana only barely swinging elsewhere in the 1936 election.

amcivwar.96.t:0 "Loyalists Rise in Pennsylvania"
amcivwar.96.d:0 "Support for the federal government remains strong even in the syndicalist heartland of Pennsylvania, and this has finally been proven as bands of loyalist militia -- reportedly organized in the city of Philadelphia -- rose up in the hills in the central part of the state, claiming the region once more for federal control. Whether they will achieve that goal and open up a new front in the civil war remains to be seen."

The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning.

This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable.

amcivwar.221.t:0 "The Germans refuse our request"
amcivwar.221.d:0 "Unfortunately the Germans have declined to protect us. We stand alone in the world."
amcivwar.221.a:0 "We will have to be independent"
amcivwar.221.b:0 "Turn to National France instead"

amcivwar.222.t:0 "Liberia stands alone"
amcivwar.222.d:0 "The tiny nation of Liberia has broken away from US protection and is now alone. We could try to seize the lands for ourselves, although this would not be a popular move among both allies and enemies."
amcivwar.222.a:0 "We have no ambitions on Liberia"
amcivwar.222.b:0 "They are unprotected - seize their lands!"

amcivwar.224.a:0 "Mobilise as many men as possible"

amcivwar.225.t:0 "The German-Afrikaans attack"
amcivwar.225.d:0 "Taking advantage of our diplomatic isolation, the German administration in Mittelafrika has decided to attack us. We have no choice but to fight for our survival."
amcivwar.225.a:0 "Mobilise as many men as possible."

amcivwar.226.t:0 "Independence in the Philippines"
amcivwar.226.d:0 "The civil war in America has left the American hold over the Philippines weakened. The people of the Philippines are demanding full independence but some in the government are worried that an independent Philippines will be absorbed by the greater powers in the area."
amcivwar.226.a:0 "Freedom. Horrible, horrible freedom"

amcivwar.227.t:0 "Seizing American Equipment"
amcivwar.227.d:0 "With the Americans heading off the island, they have left large amounts of equipment in the Philippines. The Filipino army is advocating seizing the resources while they are unguarded but the government is afraid of what this might do to the relations between the two countries."

amcivwar.227.b:0 "We should stay friendly"

amcivwar.228.t:0 "The American Mission in the Philippines"
amcivwar.228.d:0 "The war has forced the US government to recall all available units. The American forces in the Philippines are still loyal to the US government and Douglas MacArthur. Some are concerned that abandoning the Philippines will be costly but the forces are needed in America."

amcivwar.228.b:0 "We must hold our position"

amcivwar.229.t:0 "The Philippine Commonwealth"

The Commonwealth of the Philippines was created to administer the nation and transition into a full state of independence."
amcivwar.229.a:0 "Our glorious new commonwealth"

### Pre-War Events ###
amcivwar.300.t:0 "Riots in New England and New York"
amcivwar.300.d:0 "In recent days, syndicalist militias have been struggling (and failing) to take control in northeastern states, from New York and New Jersey all the way up to the coasts of Maine. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
amcivwar.300.d.assass:0 "The fallout of Bill Haywood's assassination has been felt throughout the north, but the violence is particularly intense throughout the northeastern states from New Jersey all the way up to the coasts of Maine. Several groups of SPA militia are suggesting they rise up along with the AUS, united or not, and are attempting to seize control of the area. So far, governors in the region have clamped down hard on the violence, though the result has been a series of riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself. Citizens are on edge, and governors have denied the federal government permission to raise local militias in the area, fearful of increasing tensions further. A few New England governors are reported to be quietly asking the Canadian government to intervene, should worse come to worst."
amcivwar.300.d.peace:0 "While Bill Haywood and the SPA have been trying to rein in their militias across the north, not all are in agreement that the compromise bill went far enough. Indeed, several more radical unions are still calling for strikes, and the northeastern states - from New Jersey all the way up to the coast of Maine - have been particularly hard-hit by militia violence. So far, governors in the region have clamped down on them hard, though the result has been a series of violent riots in Boston and Buffalo - not to mention a wave of uprisings still ongoing within New York City itself.

amcivwar.300.b:0 "Interesting"

amcivwar.310.t:0 "Nevada Aligns with Pacific States"
amcivwar.310.d:0 "Richard Kirman, Sr. today declared Nevada's allegiance with the Pacific States who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of General MacArthur's government. The governor had been in consultation with the Pacific government since its creation, and in a radio address said he could not stand by and let democracy fail in America without taking a stand. So far, federal forces have withdrawn from army bases in the region without threat of further violence."
amcivwar.310.a:0 "A welcome decision"
amcivwar.310.b:0 "A foolish decision"

amcivwar.311.t:0 "The 30 Day Deadline"
amcivwar.311.d:0 "The 30-day deadline by the federal government to the rebellious states has, so far, gone without any of the state governors changing their minds. The federal government is consolidating its position, but has warned MacArthur to expect further violence and state defections prior to the deadline's end. Most in Washington appear pessimistic that an all-out war can be avoided."
amcivwar.311.a:0 "We shall see"
amcivwar.311.b:0 "Unlikely"

amcivwar.312.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
amcivwar.312.d:0 "The 30-day deadline issued by the federal government is almost at an end, with none of the sides having stood down. Indeed, it's clear the rebellious states have used the intervening time to raise militias throughout their controlled areas, meaning a civil war will be a difficult fight, indeed."
amcivwar.312.a:0 "What comes shall come"

amcivwar.313.t:0 "Contact with the New York Resistance"
amcivwar.313.d:0 "Though both New York and New Jersey were thought completely lost to Federal forces, it turns out that several large groups of fighters managed to make it out of the urban areas, and have regrouped in the hills of eastern Pennsylvania. Though tattered, they are eager to continue the battle with our support."

We want to reassure them that, as American citizens, they have no reason to fear our presence. Our efforts have slowly begun to bear fruit, even in the midst of all this chaos."
amcivwar.314.a:0 "Excellent news!"

### Black Belt Integration ###

amcivwar.503.t:0 "Support the Black Belt?"
amcivwar.503.d:0 "The CAR is apparently having some trouble containing the Black Belt during the war, leading to requests from local rebels, especially radicals, to aid them in their efforts. While it may be a high price, it would damage their control of the region."

amcivwar.505.d:0 "The Black has offered to reintegrate to the United States if we grant them additional autonomy, ensure equal rights to Black Americans, create a government bureau devoted to ensuring equal hiring rights, illegalize White Leagues and pay 'restorations' to the Black Belt. While costly, the Black Belt may well be worth it. On the other hand, we could take it by force."
amcivwar.505.a:0 "Agree"

amcivwar.617.d:0 "In a rather surprising gesture of solidarity, the Vatican, under the auspices of the current Pope, has extended the offer of both weapons and supplies to the Union State. Even better, they have gone so far as to send fighting men, many of them formed from the ranks of French and Italian volunteers, to aid the Minutemen in freeing America from corruption and syndicalism. This has come as a shock to the Long administration; it's been well known that America is largely Protestant with the Catholic population, whilst large as well, mostly residing in the greater area of New England, some of them only living as far south as southern Maryland, all well out of the reach of the American Union State at present.\n\n However, Texas has a significant Catholic population, and Louisiana has Catholic sympathies as well, making it a reasonable offer on the part of the Pope. While Huey Long personally would attribute this gesture to traditional Catholic virtues of charity and diligence, as most would, some among the upper echelons of the AFP, particularly the devout Protestant Gerald L. K. Smith, despise the notion of Roman Catholic intervention, urging Huey Long to refute any attempt by the Vatican to potentially expand their influence in North America. In particular, they cite the Catholic unrest in Mexico as an example of the Papacy's 'corrosive attempt to uproot the values of the Free World'. While one can easily dismiss Smith's ravings as unfair and bigoted, the ultimate decision rests with Huey Long."
amcivwar.617.a:0 "Send our thanks to His Holiness, but we have things under control."

### Black Legion Resistance ###

amcivwar.619.t:0 "Terror of the Black Legion"
amcivwar.619.d:0 "The Black Legion is a grouping of extreme NDWL members whom view even the 'mainstream' Klan as too moderate and harken back to the First Klan under Forrest and White League groups such as Benjamin Tillman's Red Shirts leading to them and their allies being nicknamed "The Old Klan". Recently their opposition to our government as caused them to be more than just a thorn in our side and we must now counter the group to prevent their continued attacks on our officials, civilians and, when occasionally organized well-enough, supply lines."
amcivwar.619.a:0 "Lunatics!"
amcivwar.619.b:0 "Traitors!"

amcivwar.620.t:0 "Black Legion Resistance Grows"
amcivwar.620.d:0 "The Black Legion has continued to grow in recruitment size, taking up those who view them as their best chance at stomping out radicals, liberals, black activists, securing a more secure position for themselves and/or simply those using them as an excuse to act out their more sadistic impulses. The terror they inspire in the civilian population is slowing economic and political activity and tied up our forces in the backlines to subdue to them."
amcivwar.620.a:0 "We need to end this!"

amcivwar.621.t:0 "Black Legion Resistance Continues to Grow"
amcivwar.621.d:0 "The Black Legion has continued to grow in recruitment size and is becoming a greater threat to our population, with those who fall under their targeted groups often looking out of Legion activity and those who don't often being too scared to report them anyways. As they seemingly ambush and kill anyone perceived opponent they think they can get their hands on, it's clear this needs to come to an end if we are to restore stability."
amcivwar.621.a:0 "Monsters!"

amcivwar.6210.t:0 "Overwhelming Black Legion Resistance"
amcivwar.6210.d:0 "The Black Legion's terrorist activities are nearly constant at this point as well have been unable to subdue them. Activity in their strongholds has caused daily life to come to a near standstill and the government to lose much of its legitimacy. This is truly a dark hour for America."
amcivwar.6210.a:0 "Stomp them out now!"

amcivwar.622.t:0 "Black Legion Goes Undergroud!"
amcivwar.622.d:0 "The Black Legions grip has slipped as their members are being stomped out and they feel less safe being so open in their acitivies in their stronholds. They have returned to being a far more underground terrorist clique."
amcivwar.622.a:0 "It's a start"
amcivwar.622.b:0 "They have no chance"

amcivwar.623.t:0 "Black Legion wounded!"
amcivwar.623.d:0 "The Black Legions influence has fallen and the widely despised group is seeing more citizens being willing to report their whereabouts and members. They are no longer able to conduct terror activities as widely as they could."

amcivwar.623.b:0 "They have no chance"

amcivwar.624.t:0 "Black Legion loses support!"
amcivwar.624.d:0 "The Black Legion has seen crushing defeats, low recruitment and increasing opposition, leaving it closer to being the irritating (if violent) gang it orginally was than paramilitary force it became. We might be able to finish them off altogether if we keep up the presure!"
amcivwar.624.a:0 "Excellent!"

amcivwar.625.t:0 "Black Legion in Retreat!"
amcivwar.625.d:0 "The Black Legion has been utterly broken, with captured members selling one another out, their funds destroyed and most of their militants either dead or in retreat. It appears that the Black Legion has been defeated, and the government announcement that the Black Legion is in shambles has been met with celebration from citizens who can return to their lives with less fear in their lives."
amcivwar.625.a:0 "Justice at last!"

### Socialist Resistance ###

amcivwar.626.t:0 "Socialist Militancy!"
amcivwar.626.d:0 "The militant wing of the IWW, the Red Guard, and other anarchist and socialist militants, have grown in recent weeks. Generally moving beyond striking they have begun a campaign of industrial sabotage, targeted political assasinations, supply disruption and doubling down on militant propaganda designed to appeal to urban workers. These combined efforts are generally damaging our economy, especially our ability to produce raw industrial goods."
amcivwar.626.a:0 "Damn!"

amcivwar.627.t:0 "Anarchist resistance rises!"
amcivwar.627.d:0 "Anarchists have caused even more problems for us in recent days as they target our supply lines, especially our industrial production, and our supporters are becoming intimidated by their increased numbers and aggressiveness. Our politicians and wealthier supporters in particular are fearful of violent reprisals and pot shots taken at them but even others are not safe as anyone of place of business seen as 'petit-bourgeoisie collaborators' are declared targets of the Red Guards and other CSA affiliated groups. We must end this anarchist wave of violence."
amcivwar.627.a:0 "Fanatical madmen!"

amcivwar.628.t:0 "Anarchist Violence Spreads!"
amcivwar.628.d:0 "Anarchist violence has reached a tipping point as their campaign grows increasingly violent and frenzied alongside their numbers. With the Red Guard, and especially it's so-called Galleanist Collectivist wings endorsing ever more extreme measures of the Propaganda of the Deed middle and upper class districts are being bombed, priests and even smaller businessmen are being shipped timed explosives and shots are being fired at factory owners. While some socialists politicans (espeically pacifists) in the CSA have decired this the rest are either silent or supportive but our cries of the CSA being a terrorist state mean little next to the damage they are doing."
amcivwar.628.a:0 "Animals!"

amcivwar.629.t:0 "The Red Terror!"
amcivwar.629.d:0 "Our claims of having the anarchist threat under control are reaching deaf ears as increasing numbers of urban workers expect them to completely destroy our efforts, citizens are too terrified to anser mail, churches are on lockdown and politicians are demanding we immediently stop their terror campaign. The Red Terror has practically brought our economy to a halt, organizing our forces infintely more difficult then need be and the workers they target in their propaganda efforts have increasingly extremely questionable sympathies."
amcivwar.629.a:0 "We must end this!"

amcivwar.630.t:0 "Socialists disrupted!"
amcivwar.630.d:0 "Socialists organizations have been broken up in recent weeks, collapsing coordination between them. While this is hardly the end of this Red Menace they are at least not wantonly spreading a full blown terror as they once were with locals being more confident in giving information on Gallenists and Collectivists especially. Finally our industry has a chance to at least partially recover from their sabotage."
amcivwar.630.a:0 "Very Well!"

amcivwar.631.t:0 "Socialist Militias stumble!"
amcivwar.631.d:0 "The Red Guard militias have seen a fall in support recently as their militias continue to suffer from crackdowns and low recruitment rates. Politically fence-sitting workers are increasingly viewing us the future and industrial sabotage is falling."
amcivwar.631.a:0 "Absolutely wonderful!"
amcivwar.631.b:0 "Good enough!"

amcivwar.632.t:0 "Red Guards on their last legs"
amcivwar.632.d:0 "Red Guard Militias have seen blow after blow and are forced to resort to their more base tactics of ever more basic industrial sabotage and worker recruitment as they lack almost any ability to coordinate amongst each other and workers are overwhelmingly unwilling to join their cause even passively. It appears we may win this fight afterall."
amcivwar.632.a:0 "Of course we will!"

amcivwar.633.t:0 "Socialist Militias finished!"
amcivwar.633.d:0 "The socialist militias as any sort of force capable of stalling the economy or frightening our supporters is finished. While there will always be a handful of fanatical Reds willing to die for their cause it nonehteless appears these extremists are finished as a large scale threat, to the joy of our supporters."
amcivwar.633.a:0 "Great!"

### Minutemen Resistance ###

amcivwar.634.t:0 "Rise of the Minutemen!"
amcivwar.634.d:0 "The AUS-Longist alligned Minutemen have begun organizing in our territory, targeting farmers, the unemployed, the rural poor and the middle class for recruitment. With a goal of targeting our supply lines and disrupting troop coordination these rebels are inclined to loot our supply caches and encourage farmers to hide their goods from the state, resorting to destroying the crops of farmers who are allied with us. They have likewise adopted a positive attitude towards psychological warfare thanks to the advice of AFP military advisors such as Frank Hamer, killing our our officers, militants and organizers in particularly gruesome ways when the opportunity arises and conducting night raids sporadically."
amcivwar.634.a:0 "Bastards!"

amcivwar.6340.t:0 "The Minutemen Attack!"
amcivwar.6340.d:0 "The Minutemen have been increasing their coordination between themselves and the AFP, raiding our supply lines with increasing infrequency, murdering and mutiliating our low ranking officials and torturing captured officers for information they pass between themsevles. Their night attacks on our sentries has likewise seen widespread fear amongst our troops. With farmers increasingly viewing them as viable contenders in the ACW more and more are agreeing to hide their supplies out of either genuinie support or fear and unemployed men are dodging our recruitment efforts as AFP propaganda is directing them to do."
amcivwar.6340.a:0 "Find them!"

amcivwar.635.t:0 "Minutemen Support Grows"
amcivwar.635.d:0 "The Minutemen have not only not lost support but have increased it, and as a result we are dangerously low on supplies that are being either raided, burned or hidden by their agrarian supporters. Meanwhile our formerly vocal recruiters and on-the-ground officials have grown increasingly fearful of conducting their work without meeting grizzly ends and sentries must be deployed in increasingly large numbers to avoid potential ambushes. Worst yet their middle-class and unemployed support base has grown as their increasingly coordinated efforts make attempts to appeal to them and promise them a better future under the AFP, encouraging them to withhold any support they can from our government."
amcivwar.635.a:0 "Damn it!"

amcivwar.636.t:0 "The Long-Armed Menace!"
amcivwar.636.d:0 "The AFP's attempts to use the Minutemen to disrupt our activities has reached an all-time high with our military officers traveling with increasingly large numbers of guards to prevent kidnapping and certain death from the Minutemen. More activists are keeping quiet, supply caches require massive troop deployments to reliably protect, night-raids have never been more frequent and the loyalties of farmers, the middle-class and unemployed men who used to be middle-class themselves has never been more questionable. We must end the AFP's attacks on our supplies and officials at once!"
amcivwar.636.a:0 "Bastards!"

amcivwar.637.t:0 "Minutemen Disrupted!"
amcivwar.637.d:0 "The Minutemen have been losing supporters and militants in recent days, and with it the ability to coordinate as well thanks to our disruptions of their terrorism. While there is still a long ways to go our break over their control of supplies and farm goods as given our population some respite from their ruthless endeavors, and officers can conduct their works more efficiently."
amcivwar.637.a:0 "Keep it up!"

amcivwar.638.t:0 "Minutemen pushed back!"
amcivwar.638.d:0 "Minutemen bases are being exposed in increasingly large numbers and our soldiers are enthused to hear that their campaign of terrorizing them is being met with a return of force. As farmers view the AFP as a cause on the fritz they are less willing to listen to their demands, our supply caches are arriving more safety and our officials can more easily do their work. Nonethless there is a ways to go to finish the job."
amcivwar.638.a:0 "Excellent!"
amcivwar.638.b:0 "Excellent!"

amcivwar.639.t:0 "The Minutemen Struggle!"
amcivwar.639.d:0 "The Minutemen are on their last legs as their militants are captured and interrogated in increasingly large numbers and we counter their atempted raids. With AFP propaganda being largely rooted out farmers or more clearly on our side of the conflict and they can do relatively little to disrupt us. Still their sting is felt and we must finish the job if we are to maximize our supplies and troop morale."
amcivwar.639.a:0 "Then let's finish them!"

amcivwar.640.t:0 "The Minutemen crushed!"
amcivwar.640.d:0 "The Minutemen are finished! With the AFP's militia collapsing and their men either retreating or facing reprisal from our men they are finished and our people can rest easy this force of hooligans will no longer terrorize them. Supplies can move with ease and soldiers have one less worry in their lives."

amcivwar.644.t:0 "Massive Klan!"
amcivwar.644.d:0 "The KKK now has a simply massive presence in our population with virtually all civilians being aware and fearful of their presence and as a response withholding more aid from out government.

amcivwar.647.t:0 "NDWL on life-support"

amcivwar.651.t:0 "Fed Cells Gain Ground"
amcivwar.651.d:0 "Federalist resistance only continues to grow as their military cells effectively carry out operations in our territory and disrupt our intelligence operations and supply runs in the area. As a result our citizens are becoming less certain we can overcome them."

amcivwar.652.d:0 "The Federalists have gained only more recruits as they continue to efficiently damage our intelligence operations, patrols and supply runs leaving us in a bind, depleting our resources and making them the top priority of our government.

amcivwar.656.a:0 "Good!"

##REBELS Crime##

amcivwar.657.t:0 "Crime Grows"
amcivwar.657.d:0 "Not all Americans are either apathetic or deeply invested in one of the ideological factions fighting for victory as some opportunists have come onto the scene and gained serious power from the nation's weakness. Criminals have gained power from resources being spent on the military instead of internal services, taking advantage of the chaos to do what they want, including stealing, racketeering and worse. As they are simply a drain on us we will need to deal with them."
amcivwar.657.a:0 "Criminal Scum"

amcivwar.658.t:0 "Power of Organized Crime"
amcivwar.658.d:0 "Criminals have grown only more powerful due to our recent woes and the countries chaotic states, with many citizens relying on them to gain black market goods and many internal policing and legislative services being in their pocket.

amcivwar.671.a:0 "No!"

amcivwar.672.t:0 "Black Resistance Organized!"
amcivwar.672.d:0 "Black Resistance cells have put aside their common ideological differences relating to either economics or race nationalism versus civic nationalism and have come to simply agree that our government must be opposed. Organized in increasingly efficient cells they are more comfortable attacking our military police and militia supporters near their territory. Our retaliations have only driven more black Americans into their arms."
amcivwar.672.a:0 "Damn it all!"

amcivwar.673.t:0 "Black Resistance Grows!"
amcivwar.673.d:0 "More and more black Americas view the reistance cells as capable of resisting our rule and as the cells take in recruits we gain even less revenue and manpower from our black community zones while the resistance cells attack our supply caravans and hit higher ranking officials in a manner as to leave much of our political leadership in a fearful outrage alongside our military."

amcivwar.677.d:0 "Black resistance to our rule is finally collapsing as our counter-attacks on them and their sympathizers leave them increasingly unorganized and demoralized, and leave them more as loose militia groups than the more well-connected quasi-military they once were. We must finish the job."
amcivwar.677.a:0 "Finish it!"

amcivwar.678.t:0 "Black Resistance Collapses"
amcivwar.678.d:0 "Black Resistance to our regime has finally collapsed as fugitives associated with them flee our nation, usually unsuccessfully. While some militias remain they can no longer hold any black territories from our military much less hope to go on the offensive."

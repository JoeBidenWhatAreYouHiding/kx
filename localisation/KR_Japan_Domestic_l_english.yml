### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Assuming the Chrysanthemum throne after the death of his father, Emperor Taishō, His Imperial Majesty represents a divine dynasty of nearly 2,500 years; his personage seen not only as head of state, but as representative of the very heart, soul, and being of the nation. As both militarists and a resurgent left thrive amidst mounting domestic chaos, the Emperor remains silent, his role unclear and undecided. However, when and if the Emperor does make his move, it will no doubt be decisive."
POLITICS_KANSON_ARAHATA_DESC:0 "The first Chairman of the Japanese Union, Kanson Arahata, took office during the immediate change in the political landscape of the nation. Having been arrested in the Red Flag Incident, Kanson had to hide his pro-socialist tendencies, later creating a socialist underground for left-leaning activists. It is said Kanson might be responsible for all the radical left violence against the Imperial regime."

### Ideas ###

POLITICS_WEEB_EDWARD_DESC: "The Land of the Rising Sun has seen many eras and rulers reign over its lands, but never has a foreigner wielded so much power here in glorious Nihon; that is until King Edward VIII arrived on our shores. With the victory of the Entente over Japanese forces, the young king has taken the opportunity to restore an idea not seen in Japan since the Meiji Restoration. Edward has assumed the title as the 16th Shōgun of Japan, the first since Yoshinobu resigned in 1867. Though Emperor Hirohito still rules as the chief monarch of the nation, Edward and his administration now hold true power, adding the precious jewel that is Japan to the opulent crown that is the British Empire."

### Events ###

japdom.1.t:0 "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
japdom.1.d:0 "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', the 1920s were marked by economic depression and political instability in Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector and caused a massive demographic change, as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market, and further driving down wages.\n\nAfter leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his cabinet successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment have fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."
japdom.1.a:0 "Gaman shiyou."

japdom.2.t:0 "Dissolution of the Diet"
japdom.2.d:0 "The four-year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called for a general election to happen as soon as possible."
japdom.2.a:0 "Very well."

japdom.3.t:0 "General Election 1936"
japdom.3.d:0 "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyukai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party).\n\nThe Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (Their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933.\n\nIt is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
japdom.3.a:0 "The Seiyukai have defended their absolute majority!"
japdom.3.b:0 "The Seiyukai have lost their absolute majority!"

japdom.4.t:0 "The Assassination of Katayama Sen"
japdom.4.d:0 "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed, and was influenced by Bill Haywood's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements.\n\nYesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."
japdom.4.a:0 "This will be bad..."

japdom.5.t:0 "Friction Within the Japanese Left"
japdom.5.d:0 "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the "white terror", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirokei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party, at the expense of the moderate Shaminkei, (Social Democratic Clique) but also from outside the party, notably from the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sodomei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon, an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirokei accused the Sodomei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sodomei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirokei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirokei's members were expelled from both the Sodomei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."

japdom.6.t:0 "The May 15th Incident"
japdom.6.d:0 "The Prime Minister has been assassinated! Radical officers connected to the Nichirokei broke into his official residence and shot Prime Minister Inukai. They claim they did so to avenge the death of Katayama Sen and the murder of workers in Niigata. The incident has greatly shocked the nation, and the Admiralty Board, mortified by the incident, has already begun a court martial and a deep investigation into radical activities within the Navy."

japdom.7.t:0 "Restorationists and Centralists"
japdom.7.d:0 "The 'Ishinha', restoration faction is a political ideology promoted by radical junior officers, characterised by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered to be the evil influence of favouritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor, and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them are the 'Chuushinha', the central faction, who were close to the central military leadership who supported cooperation with the establishment, and the militarisation of politics."
japdom.7.a:0 "This will be trouble..."

japdom.8.t:0 "The Security Debate"
japdom.8.d:0 "The debate in the Imperial Diet has steadily increased the last few months, and is now reaching a terrifying level. Many members fear for their lives, and so, progress isn't just a matter of political power or personal pride, but of survival. There is a growing consensus that the current security laws aren't enough to protect democracy and that more are needed. The May 15th Incident must not be allowed to happen again."
japdom.8.a:0 "A comprehensive law, an act, must be made!"

japdom.9.t:0 "The National Security Act"
japdom.9.d:0 "The notorious Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime amidst the red scare following the Kanto anarchist uprising in September 1923, and a syndicalist assassination attempt on then-Crown Prince Hirohito in December of the same year. The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburo now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition, even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favour of the Act."
japdom.9.a:0 "We must defend our Democracy by any means necessary; the Act is forced through."
japdom.9.b:0 "Public opinion and the opposition defeat the Act."

japdom.10.t:0 "The Trial of the May 15th Incident"
japdom.10.d:0 "The court martial of the eleven murderers of Prime Minister Inukai began last month. Before the end of their trial a petition arrived at court, containing over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers around the country, pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata, asking that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sending eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to convince the court to accelerate the process, and although the death sentences were issued just yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today."
japdom.10.a:0 "This country is going crazy..."

japdom.11.t:0 "The Assassination of Suzuki Kisaburo"
japdom.11.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened again! Prime Minister Suzuki and his brother-in-law Hatoyama Ichiro were attending a party rally in Kawagoe today. When Hatoyama stood up to deliver his speech, a syndicalist terrorist from the 'Saitama Youth Volunteer Corps for National Salvation', shot Suzuki and Hatoyama in retaliation for the execution of Prime Minister Inukai's assassins. Suzuki's wound has proven fatal."
japdom.11.a:0 "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

japdom.12.t:0 "Government under Fire"
japdom.12.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the failure to pass the National Security Act has created a backlash against the Prime Minister. The conservatives and bureaucrats who had backed the bill feel betrayed by Suzuki's back-down. The House of Peers and the Privy Council, disappointed by the Government's inability to produce any measures against syndicalism, have lost all their patience with the cabinet."

japdom.13.t:0 "Resignation of Suzuki Kisaburo"
japdom.13.d:0 "Abandoned by everyone, the humiliated Prime Minister resigned when the Peers passed a censure motion denouncing the cabinet and, with lukewarm support, former Home Minister Mizuno Rentaro was appointed in his place. Ominously, the Privy Council and its ultraconservative chairman Baron Hiranuma released a statement declaring that the 'parliamentary impotency' needs to be replaced by a more stable system."

From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, though he has stopped short of crowning himself chairman, and appointed current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentaro instead."

japdom.16.d:0 "After ten years of political disgrace, the army has taken power again, this time by a coup d'état. Ultraconservative politician Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro is now Prime Minister, and a state of martial law has been enacted across all of the Greater Japanese Empire."
japdom.16.a:0 "Banzai!"

japdom.17.t:0 "Failed Coup Attempt"
japdom.17.d:0 "Even through the Army Minister refused to support the coup, he made no effort to stop the plot. The plotters interpreted this as a signal of permission, and proceeded. This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the surprise of the plotters, the Emperor resisted the coup d'état and issued an imperial command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly caught, while some took their own lives before they could be arrested."
japdom.17.a:0 "Democracy has prevailed!"

japdom.18.t:0 "The Power Struggle"
japdom.18.d:0 "Restorationist officers were the main participants of the coup that overthrew the elected government, for they saw the parliamentary system as a plutocratic capitalist institution. Under the successive government however, the Centralists took the leading role in the new regime and the Restorationists were marginalised from the leadership. The Restorationist leadership has concluded that they were deceived. A new power struggle has begun."
japdom.18.a:0 "Will this ever end?"

japdom.19.t:0 "The Ishinha Counter-Coup"
japdom.19.d:0 "Earlier today, Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. In the afternoon, the emperor himself addressed the soldiers announcing his official support of their revolution."
japdom.19.a:0 "The coup is successful!"

The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. After the emperor explicitly denounced the putschists the navy mobilised marine divisions to rescue the palace, and by the evening the coup was crushed."
japdom.20.a:0 "Thank god for the navy!"

japdom.21.t:0 "The Centralists Win!"
japdom.21.d:0 "The Restorationist coup has been defeated. Branded traitors, the Restorationists are being purged all over the country. There are calls for the Army to assume a greater role in government to help root out both the traitors and the syndicalists."

japdom.22.t:0 "The Government of National Unity"
japdom.22.d:0 "Nakajima Chikuhei from the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo from the Minseito, both supporters of the National Security Act, have issued a joint statement, urging both the mainstream parties to form a multi-party 'Government of National Unity' to protect the Kokutai (national polity) from the syndicalist threat."
japdom.22.a:0 "We need a strong government."
japdom.22.b:0 "We don't need your nonsense; an election is what we need!"

japdom.23.t:0 "On the Basic Principles of National Defence"
japdom.23.d:0 "After taking power, the Centralists sought a political blueprint for their new regime. They have presented such a blueprint, titled 'On the Basic Principles of National Defence' and have distributed it among the Centralist leadership. Envisioning an 'Advanced National Defence State' (Kodo Kokubo Kokka), the document proposes to transform the state into one geared and ready for total war. To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line."
japdom.23.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.24.t:0 "On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure"
japdom.24.d:0 "'On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure' is a 156 page pamphlet produced by the Ministry of Education to establish an official description of the 'Kokutai', or national structure (It can also can be translated as 'national essence', 'national polity', etc). The pamphlet officially enshrines the Emperor as a living god, according to the legend of the Goddess Amaterasu and 'an unbroken line of emperors' (Banseiikkei). To serve the divine Emperor, his subjects were required to cast themselves aside for the social harmony (Wa) and for the prosperity of Japanese culture. To some extent, the pamphlet is a response to criticism of the Centralist's 'Neo-Shogunism'."
japdom.24.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.25.t:0 "The New System Movement"
japdom.25.d:0 "To mobilise support for the regime and its reform programme, the 'New System Movement' (Shintaisei Undo) has been organised. Led by Prince Konoe Fumimaro, the movement aims for the creation of a political institution that is capable of merging and binding people into the organic whole of the nation - basically a Japanese breed of corporatism, with the Emperor at its head. The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one party- the Imperial Rule Assistance Society (Taisei Yokusankai)."
japdom.25.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.26.t:0 "The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai"
japdom.26.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai, or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level, a direct link between politics and the people will be established. By having every important interest group represented at its core, it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policies. Sadly, that vision has already collapsed, as the various movements the Taisei Yokusankai was meant to bind together have already begun to argue and compete for control of the society.\n\nThree main groups have emerged at the convention. The leading group is the Kakushinha (Reformist Faction) headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself, composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. The second group is the Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kodo', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association).\n\nThe latter two object to the Kakushinha's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition."

japdom.29.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

japdom.31.t:0 "General Election"
japdom.31.d:0 "Democracy has survived the fateful winter and election reform securing its place has been passed. However, with the failure of the National Unity government the government lacks the power and mandate to rule effectively. The solution is clear however: trust in its election reforms and take the issue to the people; the Government has called an election to confirm its electoral mandate and regain the political initiative!"

japdom.31.b:0 "Elect Minseito (Liberals)."
japdom.31.c:0 "Maintain the ruling coalition."

japdom.32.t:0 "A Party Divided"
japdom.32.d:0 "During the Rikken Seiyukai convention of 1936, Nakajima had felt his leading role was insecure and made power-sharing agreements with other factions. One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council.\n\nLast month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted to complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Domei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Domei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyukai."

japdom.35.t:0 "The Cabinet Planning Board"
japdom.35.d:0 "With the Black Monday recession, general economic and political turmoil threatening the Japanese export markets in the Pacific, the Government has begun to review its economic policies. We mainly export raw silk and other consumer goods- our industrial goods are still inadequate compared with most western nations. Various measures to remedy the situation have been suggested and a Cabinet Planning Board (Kikakuin) has been established to study and plan future economic policy."
japdom.35.a:0 "Good."

japdom.36.t:0 "Zaibatsu Corruption Scandal"
japdom.36.d:0 "As we feared, today several high-ranking government officials with links to the Zaibatsu have been accused of corruption. This is not the first time such accusations have been made and we fear it will not be the last. While some say it is good they were caught, it nevertheless represents another blow to our government given our close support of the Zaibatsu.\n\nThe trial will start in a few days but given the vast amount of wealth these officials will be able to mobilise it will no doubt be a long and painful road to justice, if we ever even get there... "

japdom.51.t:0 "Tokko Officers Accused of Torture"
japdom.51.d:0 "The Tokko, or 'Special Higher Police', is a police force specialising in social and thought crimes. The Tokko is also notorious for its abusive and brutal methods of interrogation, sometimes even resulting in death. When the National Security Act was passed, the Tokko rapidly expanded its size and operation, and their regard for the safety of accused criminals declined even further. Today a major newspaper has reported that a man died while in custody, and has accused the Tokko of torturing the victim to death."
japdom.51.a:0 "Oh no..."

japdom.52.t:0 "The Repeal of the National Security Act"

japdom.53.t:0 "The Great Drought of 1939"
japdom.53.d:0 "The country is in the middle of the worst drought it has seen this century. Water supplies are critically low and crops are dying of thirst. In some regions, local officials are organising rainmaking rituals in a desperate attempt to evoke storms and calm the people, but to no avail. Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However, the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being."

It is quite obvious that the Imperial Family cannot function like it used to for over a thousand years. A change is needed. We can either bring ourselves to drastic measures or treat the issue more lightly - as to not make more enemies in the Japanese society. What should we do?"
japdom.241.a:0 "Put them against the wall."
japdom.241.b:0 "Leave them be, but powerless. They will no longer be aristocracy."
japdom.241.c:0 "Exile them."

japdom.242.t:0 "Black Monday Reaches the Shores"
japdom.242.d:0 "Eventually, as expected, the domino effect of the economic failure in the German Empire has reached our Empire. While we are not as affected as our neighbours in the region, due to our quite grand economic isolation from the German markets, we still were touched by it. The Zaibatsu and our banks will have a hard time for those few months."
japdom.242.a:0 "That was to be expected."

japdom.243.t:0 "Disagreements Within Army Leadership"
japdom.243.d:0 "The ongoing factional rivalry within the ranks of the IJA has found a new front: the military strategic debate between the two rising stars, Major General Nagata Tetsuzan (of the Centralist Faction) and Major General Obata Toshishiro (of the Restorationist Faction).\n\nGeneral Nagata believes the Japanese economy is inadequate to sustain any kind of total warfare, and thus, building up an army capable of total war should be our top objective. He calls for expanding our mobilisation capability, modernising equipment, and centralising the command structure.\n\nGeneral Obata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion; due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capacity through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war.\n\nBoth agree a centralised command structure is a good idea, and that raw manpower tactics are a poor strategy; we can never hope to compete with Russian or Chinese manpower. We may now choose how to proceed."
japdom.243.a:0 "I will choose wisely."

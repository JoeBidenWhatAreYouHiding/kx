crm.1.t: "Modern Crimean History"
crm.1.d: "Since ancient times, the Crimean peninsula was a place of confluence of many cultures and nationalities, including Greeks, Romans, Khazars, Cumanians, Genoese and, finally, Russians, Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars.\n\nThe modern history of Crimea begins in 1917, when on the wave of revolutionary events in Russia, the first Turkic secular democratic state - the Crimean People's Republic emerged on the shards of the once great empire. An elected Qurultai of Crimean Tatars proclaimed the independence of the Crimean state, but soon afterward the island was seized by Bolshevik-minded forces, who were able to hold power for only a few months. Nevertheless, during these few months, a terrible red terror broke out in Crimea, claiming the lives of many people.\n\nIn June 1918, the peninsula was occupied by the Kaiser's troops and the power shifted to the pro-German Crimean regional government headed by Suleiman Sulkevich. The whole activity of the government was under the full control of the occupation command. In July, 1918 the governmental delegation visited Berlin with the purpose to make the German government recognize the independence of Crimea from the Ukraine, to get credits from it and to establish trade relations with Germany. On the sidelines of the German government a memorandum of the Crimean Tatar Directorate on the establishment of the Crimean Khanate under the patronage of Germany and Turkey was also proposed to the German government. However, these proposals were not supported in Berlin.\n\nThe Crimean government's relations with Skoropadskyi had not been established. In September-October in Kyiv the Crimean-Ukrainian negotiations took place, at which the Ukrainian delegation proposed the Crimea's joining Ukraine as a part of Ukraine with the rights of an extremely broad autonomy. The Crimean delegation made a counter-proposal: establishment of a federative union. Unfortunately, an agreement could not be reached, and as a result, for a time two nominally independent states, Ukraine and Crimea, existed under German occupation. This state of affairs was beneficial to Germany, which could manipulate both sides and siphon resources from them. By the end of 1919, however, the decision was made - Crimea was included into the Ukrainian state on the rights of wide autonomy, as a guarantor of Ukraine's fulfillment of the \"Bread Peace\". Despite the autonomy, the autocratic government of Ukraine did not actually implement it, engaging in Ukrainization and integration of the peninsula."
crm.1.a: "Ant Etkenmen!"

crm.2.t: "The Divided Peninsula"
crm.2.d: "Crimea is inhabited by various peoples, but in general, the 4 most numerous stand out: Russians, who make up about 40% of the population, Ukrainians, who make up about 30%, Crimean Tatars, who make up about 20%, as well as Crimeans, Karaites and others.\n\nNow the government of Solomon Krym, which has supreme authority over the peninsula, in fact represents only 20% of the population, while the Russian majority, the Ukrainian and Jewish minorities are alienated from the governance of the state. Despite the fact that the Government declares the freedom of expression of the will of the people immediately after the acquisition of sovereignty by the peninsula, their true intentions are questioned.\n\nRussian Russian majority, at the same time, is in some political isolation, as it does not border with Russia either by land or by sea, and is surrounded either by the water or by anti-Russian-minded countries. In addition, there is no significant political organization in Crimea that defends the rights of Russians.\n\nHowever, the Karaite minority stands out in particular - the Turkic population, which professes one of the currents of Judaism. The leader of their community is Gahan Seraya Shapshal, known for his eccentric statements and unhealthy interest in the history of the Khazar Khaganate."
crm.2.a: "Interesting"

crm.3.t: "The Autonomous Governorate of Crimea"
crm.3.d: "During the Russian Civil War, the Crimea unwittingly became one of the most horrific places. The red terror that swept through the region wiped out the cream of Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian intelligentsia, and nearly destroyed the Black Sea fleet. In 1918, on the ruins of Bolshevik Crimea there was created an independent Tatar state - the Crimean People's Republic, whose fate, however, turned out to be short-lived. Existing largely due to German guarantees and the Kaiser's troops there, the Crimea was able to survive for almost two years, until it was finally reunited with the Mother Ukraine.\n\nFor all these years the Skoropadsky government had tried unsuccessfully to annex Crimea, which the Germans had used as a bargaining chip and leverage for both states. Eventually, under the weight of internal and external problems, the Crimean government fell and the holy place was soon occupied by the Hetman army. Crimea was handed over to Ukraine with the terms of wide autonomy, and so the Autonomous Crimean Governorate came into being. However, the local legislation was made dependent on the goodwill of Hetman: if he did not want it, he would not approve it, and there was no way for the Crimeans to override a veto.\n\nHowever, for many in Ukraine, it is only a matter of time before autonomy is abolished."
crm.3.a: "Eventually, Crimea will be fully integrated."

crm.4.t: "Securing Our Foothold in Crimea?"
crm.4.d: "In 1919, the pro-German government of formally independent Crimea was dissolved in accordance with our agreement with Hetman Skoropadsky, and the peninsula itself became part of the Ukrainian State on the rights of broad autonomy.\n\nDespite this, our command always had its own plans for the Crimea. First, Crimea was an excellent bargaining chip and a means of manipulation both for Crimea itself and for Ukraine and Russia. Second, there were proposals to create a German crown colony in the Crimea for all German colonists in southern Ukraine and Russia. Nevertheless, our command decided to give the Crimea to Ukraine as a guarantee that they would fulfill the terms of the \"Brotfrieden\". Our garrison, however, remained in Sevastopol until this year, when all German troops were withdrawn from the Ukraine. Now that the situation in Ukraine is very unstable, we must bet on Crimea - to force the new or old government to fulfill our terms. \n\nHowever, this now involves a number of difficulties. In order to bring the garrison back to the peninsula, we need passage through the Turkish straits - thankfully, we have such access and the General Staff believes a small contingent of soldiers would be enough and won't cause much attention. On the other hand, we can leave Crimea with the hope that an agreement can be reached with the victorious side in Ukraine."
crm.4.a: "Invade Crimea and establish our administration there!"
crm.4.b: "We should leave Ukraine alone for now." #-> independent Crimea resistance

#1 Only German Garrison (event for Germany)
crm.8.t: "German Garrison Established in Crimea"
crm.8.d: "We managed to outwit the Turkish government, and taking advantage of the incomplete defeat of the Kingdom of Ukraine so far, we were able to send a garrison to the Crimea to establish our control there.\n\nThe entire peninsula is now under the full control of German forces. The head of the Sevastopol garrison, Prince Reuss, has been reappointed and is now in charge of the occupation administration on the peninsula. There is still much to be done to secure the peninsula for certain, but we have already done the most important thing"
crm.8.a: "The German rule over Crimea is now secured."
crm.8.b: "The Crimea will be free of Ukrainians (Play as Crimea)"

# Only German Garrison (event for Ukraine and Dyrektoria)
crm.9.t: "Germany Intervenes in Crimea"
crm.9.d: "Taking advantage of our weakness, Germany decided to intervene in the conflict - at least not directly. Apparently, it is beneficial for Germany to maintain instability in Ukraine, but it is also important for them to observe the Bread Peace. To this end, the German command ordered the capture of the Crimean Peninsula and the installation of an occupation administration there.\n\nIt is likely that in the future Crimea will once again become a bargaining chip in our relations with Germany and they will try to take advantage of the situation to continue to siphon bread and other foodstuffs from us for their citizens and their great army"
crm.9.a: "How dare they?!"

# Only German Garrison (event for Crimea)
crm.10.t: "Deutsche Garnison von Sewastopol"
crm.10.d: "As the German intervention in Crimea during the unrest in Ukraine continued, the Deutsche Garnison von Sewastopol (German Garrison of Sevastopol) established its hold on the strategically important Black Sea port city. With the establishment of the Colonial Administration, the Garrison faced the challenge of maintaining order and preventing unrest from the local population, especially the Crimean Tatars.\n\nThe Colonial Administration quickly realized that winning the hearts and minds of the Crimean Tatars was of utmost importance. They sought to provide basic necessities, such as food, shelter, and medical care, to the local population. German engineers were tasked with improving the infrastructure of Sevastopol and its surroundings - repairing damaged roads and rebuilding bridges. German doctors were sent in to help combat the outbreak of diseases and provide medical care. However, despite these measures, the locals remained wary of their new German rulers.\n\nThe Crimean Tatars had a complicated history with foreign intervention, and the German intervention was no different. Many locals resented the German presence and viewed them as yet another occupying force, with the propaganda slowly appearing against the Germans to incite the population against them. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the Ottoman Empire, which had long been an ally and protector of the Crimean Tatars, has unclear position considering German occupation of the peninsula.\n\nThe fate of Sevastopol and the German intervention rests on the outcome of these early, fraught weeks of the Colonial Administration. They are determined to establish a strong foothold and turn Sevastopol into a bridgehead for German power in the Black Sea, no matter the challenges they faced from the local population."
crm.10.a: "Is there any hope for Tatars now?"

crm.11.t: "The Dawn of New Crimea"
crm.11.d: "Following the swift and effective suppression of Crimean Tatar resistance, the German Colonial Administration now sets its sights on ensuring long-lasting stability in the region. With rebellion quelled and unrest at an all-time low, the Administration deems it the perfect time to revisit a once-forgotten proposal from Pastor Immanuel Winkler.\n\nConceived back in 1918, the Winkler Plan proposes the establishment of a German Crown Colony of Crimea-Taurida (Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien) as a means to guarantee stability within the region and provide a place for the 'Black Sea Germans' to safely live in. The plan envisions on leveraging Germany's influence and resources to not only maintain order, but also facilitate social and economic development within the region. However, the potential for local resentment remains high, with many Tatars still accusing the Germans of exploitation and excessive control.\n\nAs the German Colonial Administration discusses the Winkler Plan's potential to bring lasting peace, stability, and development to Crimea, all eyes are on their decision. Still, considering the tumultuous situation in the peninsula, the German Colonial Administration sees the Winkler Plan as a viable lifeline."
crm.11.d2: "The German Colonial Administration stands at a crucial crossroads in Crimea. Having successfully negotiated with the Crimean Tatar rebels, they must decide the fate of the region. The negotiated agreement stipulates relinquising power to the Crimean Directory, allowing the Tatars limited self-governance under the condition that Crimea remains occupied and within Germany's sphere of influence.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative. A long-forgotten proposal by pastor Immanuel Winkler back in 1918 suggests the establishment of a Crown Colony of Crimea-Taurida (Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien) as a German colony. This plan, ambitious and morally questionable, would seize direct control over the region and exploit its resources for the German Empire.\n\nAdopting Winkler's colonial plan would unquestionably outrage the Crimean Tatars, possibly even leading to renewed unrest and conflict. The German Administration must tread carefully, weighing the benefits and risks of each option."
crm.11.a: "Proclaim the Kronkolonie!"
crm.11.b: "Act according to the treaty with Tatars."

crm.15.t: "Germany Establishes Control Over Crimea"
crm.15.d: "With Ukraine in Chaos, the German Empire has decided to intervene, but instead of direct military aid, they have managed to seize control over the Crimean Peninsula, establishing their garrison and occupation administration there under Prince Reuss. The future of Crimea is unknown as many powers both inside Crimea and outside are trying to seize control."
crm.15.a: "Is there any hope for Crimean Tatars now?"

# Events 
crm.17.t: "Ottomans Have No Interest in Crimea"
crm.17.d: "The Ottoman government has refused to intervene, leaving us with the only option to do it with our own means. While we still can, we can send the garrison to the Crimea over the still not captured lands of the Kingdom of Ukraine."
crm.17.a: "Go for it!"

crm.18.t: "Jafer Seidamet Returns from Constantinople"
crm.18.d: "As the German Colonial Administration continues its endeavors to establish and secure its hold on Sevastopol and surrounding territories, new challenges continue to arise. News of Jafer Seidamet's return from Constantinople has caught the attention of authorities. Seidamet, a prominent figure in Crimean Tatar politics, has long been vocal in his opposition against foreign rule in Crimea. As the charismatic leader of the so-called \"Crimean Directory\", Seidamet is believed to be formulating a plan to create a legitimate government representative of the Crimean Tatar people. \n\nThis development is concerning for the German Colonial Administration, as Seidamet's presence could potentially ignite further unrest among the local Crimean Tatar population. The Crimean Directory claims to serve as the representation of the people's interests, and Seidamet has long enjoyed widespread support from the Tatars, bolstered by Ottoman approval. There is a pressing need for the Administration to address this situation and prevent any escalation of tension."
crm.18.a: "We should keep an eye on him!"
crm.18.b: "Tell me more about this 'Directory'"

crm.19.t: "The Crimean Directory's Rise from Exile"
crm.19.d: "The history of the Crimean Directory traces back to 1919 when Ukraine annexed Crimea. The previous government, led by Matvey Sulkevich, was pro-German in orientation and appeared to be a bargaining chip in negotiations between Germany and Ukraine. Following this annexation, Sulkevich resigned, and his successor, Jafer Seidamet, was unable to negotiate favorable terms with the Ukrainian government.\n\nDespite being granted limited autonomy under the watchful eye of Kaiserreich, some Crimean Tatar leaders rejected the new government. Their staunch disapproval and growing resentment towards the Ukrainian administration ultimately forced Jafer Seidamet and Asan Sabri Ayvazov, another prominent Tatar leader, to flee to the Ottoman Empire. Fearing arrest and imprisonment for their alleged \"separatist\" activities, the two leaders established the Crimean Directory in exile.\n\nAlthough none has recognized the Crimean Directory as an official government, Seidamet's recent return to Crimea from Constantinople sparked concern in the German Colonial Administration. The Directory's claim to represent the interests of the Crimean Tatar people poses a threat to the delicate balance of power in the region. As the German Colonial Administration struggles to maintain control in the face of this new challenge, the Crimean Directory serves as a reminder of the Tatar people's resilience in the face of annexation and foreign rule. We must tread carefully in our dealings with Crimea moving forward, as the spirit of defiance embodied by the Crimean Directory could reignite the fire of unrest among the local population."
crm.19.a: "Interesting."

crm.20.t: "Turbulent Times in Crimea"
crm.20.d: "The ever-growing defiance among the Crimean Tatar people has reached its tipping point. Fueled by the return of their exiled leaders - Jafer Seidamet and Asan Sabri Ayvazov, the Tatars are now determined to reclaim their independence and make their voices heard.\n\nDespite the lack of international recognition for the Crimean Directory, the return of Seidamet and Ayvazov has emboldened the Tatar dissidents and ultimately catalyzed the formation of local resistance groups. These fierce rebels, armed and inspired, are now poised to confront the German Colonial Administration and their hold on the peninsula.\n\nFacing an increasingly tumultuous environment, the Colonial Administration is now left with the daunting task of quelling the unrest. With the Tatar rebels gaining momentum, threatening to upheave the delicate balance that once maintained the relative peace, the Administration fears imminent and potentially catastrophic results.\n\nIn an effort to preserve their hold on the peninsula, the German Colonial Administration has a critical decision to make: whether maintaining a firm grip on Crimea through force, diplomacy, or employing alternative strategies is the solution to this spiraling crisis. As the tides turn decidedly against the status quo, all eyes are on this once idyllic and contested land - with the future of the region hanging in balance."
crm.20.a: "Crush the revolt!"
crm.20.b: "Germans have no place in our Crimea!"

crm.21.t: "German Garrison Invades Tauria!"
crm.21.d: "The German Garrison has invaded the Tauria region and now has access to Dnieper waters! Despite violation of our recognized borders, the German Administration of Crimea argues that they do that because of the revolution happening in our country, in order to create a 'zone of stability'. While the German ambassador has assured us that these measures are temporary, we are receiving information that the Crimea has been also infiltrated by the Crimean Tatar rebels, who are against the rule and can overthrow the German command."
crm.21.a: "Catastrophic!"

crm.22.t: "Germany Puts the Black Sea Fleet Under 'Protection'"
crm.22.d: "With the real danger coming from the sailors of the Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet, the German Command in Crimea has seized the entire our fleet, transfering it to the 'German Crimean Administration'. While we predicted this step, we could do nothing to stop the Germans. It seems that the whole situation would be resolved only after Ukraine becomes stable again."
crm.22.a: "So they are just stealing our navy now?!"

crm.23.t: "Replacing the Flags"
crm.23.d.ger: "The quick and bloodless invasion of Crimea turned to be a great challenge for the Deutsche Garnison. Soon, the majority of land fell under control of the Crimean Directory, due to their popularity among the people and guerrilla warfare against us. Unable to control the peninsula, the Sewastopol Garnison was first forced to flee the whole peninsula just to the Port of Sevastopol, but even there the resources were not enough. Seizing all the navy in port, the Garnison was forced to flee Crimea.\n\nThe Crimean Directory has secured power over the whole Peninsula, and with the German flags torn, the Blue Flags are now all over Crimea."
crm.23.d.crm: "The Germans though that they will quickly invade our land, but thanks to the efforst of Directory and power of the people, that united under the Tatar flags, we managed to get rid of German invaders!\nWith the Blue flags now all across Crimea, Directory is ready to implement their first reforms, aimed to secure the Crimean Tatar population."
crm.23.a: "[CRM_crm_23]"

crm.24.t: "Failure of the Crimean Colonial Administration"
crm.24.d: "Despite all odds, the local uprising of the Crimean Tatars have forced the Deutsche Garnison out of the peninsula. The Crimean Directory, mostly comprised of leftists of Tatars' 'National Party' has already secured their power all across the peninsula and positions themselves as the legitimate government. What shall we do?"
crm.24.a: "Immediate intervention in the Crimea!"
crm.24.b: "Impose strict sanctions on the new government!"
crm.24.c: "We've lost the peninsula!"

crm.25.t: "Germany Imposed Strict Sanctions!"
crm.25.d: "The German government has imposed strict sanctions on us, banning all trade with us. It was an expected step, however, as German colonialists have failed. Despite their harsh measures, there are still countries that we could rely on."
crm.25.a: "We will survive without them!"

crm.26.t: "Failure of the Revolution!"
crm.26.d.ger: "The quick and bloodless invasion of Crimea turned to be a great challenge for the Deutsch Garnison. Soon, the majority of land fell under control of the Crimean Directory, that claims itself as the legitimate government of the Crimean Tatars.\nHowever, they failed at managing the uprising and it was effectively crushed by our Administration. With some of the leaders of rebels escaped, some put under arrest, the German flags are now all across Crimea, and [CRM.GetLeader] is ready to implement the reforms."
crm.26.d.crm: "Despite all our efforts, unfortunately, we could not defeat the German might. The colonial administration of Kaiserreich managed to outnumber our troops and effectively defeated us, using propaganda and collaborators amoung our people. With our defeat, a sad page of Crimean history was opened, and while most of Directory command managed to escape to Turkey, the Crimean people are under great threat."
crm.26.a: "[CRM_crm_26]"

crm.27.t: "Negotiations With Crimean Directory"
crm.27.d: "With the uprising getting stronger each day, the Administration has decided to negotiate with the rebels. After all, we will need help of the locals and we should get along with them. The representatives of Directory recently arrived to the place of meeting, ready to listen to our demands."
crm.27.a: "Offer them representation in the administration"

crm.28.t: "Crimean Directory Demands Client State Status"
crm.28.d: "The Directory refused our demands and made their counter-proposal. Instead, they demand for the whole colonial administration to resign and let the Directory rule. In return, they are ready to sign all agreements with Germany and the Reichspakt to stay in the alliance and become Germany's loyal ally."
crm.28.a: "We have our owns plan for Crimea..."
crm.28.b: "At least we will secure Crimea in the Reichspakt!"

crm.29.t: "Crimean Directory Demands Full Withdrawal of Germany!"
crm.29.d: "The Directory has rejected our demands and instead demanded full withdrawal of German forces from Crimea. Without this 'simple' demand, they won't proceed to any further negotiations with us."
crm.29.a: "We cannot do this."

crm.30.t: "Success of the Negotiations!"
crm.30.d: "The negotiations have ended. The Crimean Directory has agreed to lay down arms, though at a cost of their government in control. For the German Administration, this day was the last as for authorities, and even though the contingent of German troops stays, the Colonial plans were scrapped for stability and order."
crm.30.a: "A toast to the Tatars!"

crm.31.t: "A Deal with the Devil"
crm.31.d: "With the German pressure on us getting weaker each day, the Directory decided that it would be appropriate to stop the bloodshed and send an ultimatum to the Germans to withdraw all their forces. It is likely that they will reject this ultimatum, but ask for some concessions in order to find a compromise."
crm.31.a: "Demand withdrawal of German forces!"

crm.32.t: "German Counter-Proposal"
crm.32.d1: "As expected, the German Administration has rejected our demands. Instead, they told they could agree for the armistice and can suggest our representation in the Administration. While this effectively means that all the power will still be in their hands, the Crimean Directory believes that it is necessary to continue our fight."
crm.32.d2: "As expected, the German Administration has rejected our demands. Instead, they told they could agree for resigning and transferring the power to Directory, if the German troops are allowed to stay on Peninsula. This effectively means that we will become a German puppet state without any chance to correct our foreign policy."
crm.32.a: "We can't agree to this!"
crm.32.b: "We have to agree to this!"

crm.33.t: "Success of the Negotiations!"
crm.33.d: "The negotiations have ended. The German Administration has agreed to lay down arms, though at a cost of our government in control. For the German Administration, this day will be the last as for authorities, and even though we agreed that their forces will stay on the Peninsula, their colonial plans are scrapped for the sake of Crimean Tatar independence, even 'formal'."
crm.33.a: "A toast to the Germans!"

crm.34.t: "Delegation From [CRM.GetNameDef]"
crm.34.d.ott: "A Crimean Tatar delegation arrived in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] to ask for mediation in negotiations with [GER.GetName].\n\nDue to the ongoing civil war in Ukraine, Germany intervened in the Crimea and established their administration there. Local Crimean Tatar separatists rebelled against the Kaiserreich, demanding independence. Berlin did not come up with anything better than to brutally suppress the uprising, and now it has come to full-fledged military operations. At the moment, part of the Crimea has been captured by the troops of the German army under the command of Heinrich XXXIII Reuss of Köstritz, but the Crimean Tatar militias demand full control over the entire peninsula and official recognition of their independence by Germany.\n\nWe are united by centuries-old friendship with the Crimean Tatars, and on the one hand, we can support the independence of the Crimean Tatars, though in exchange for certain conditions. We can demand the restoration of the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of the Giray dynasty, whose representative, Sultan Kadyr Giray, chairman of the Circassian-Georgian Society, has been living in Constantinople since the 1920s. On the other hand, we can recognize the existing Republican government. We have nothing to do with Ukraine, but we cooperate with Berlin, which can put pressure on Ukraine. In any case, peace will be concluded only if the Ottoman troops enter the territory of the Crimea as defenders and protectors of the newly formed state."

On the other hand, support for Crimea now is undoubtedly a violation of the Minsk Agreement, which we are currently unable to cancel. We can try to come to an agreement with Ukraine to resolve the issue peacefully, but it is unknown whether we will be able to really influence the Ukrainian leadership. It is also important to note that the Crimean Tatar government is ruling in Crimea now, and, of course, it will act in the interests of its people, and we must make sure that the rights of Russians are not infringed."

In addition to this, however, the Dyrektoria stipulates that the rights of all peoples inhabiting the Crimea must be respected, thanks to the principle of national-cultural-personal autonomy. In foreign relations, Ukraine reserves the right to determine the foreign policy of Crimea, but gives full freedom within the framework of concluding trade agreements and other cultural activities.

crm.85.t: "Ties With [FROM.GetName]"
crm.85.d: "Our delegation received a warm welcome in [FROM.GetName] and some diplomatic relations were installed, as well as several trade agreements signed. We will likely ask to join their alliance soon as well."
crm.85.a: "Great! Send our proposal!"

crm.86.t: "Ties With [FROM.GetName]"
crm.86.d: "Our delegation received a warm welcome, in general, in [FROM.GetName]. We have installed diplomatic relations and signed several trade agreements, however, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation was critical of our joining their alliance, probalby because of a possible war with Russia over our country."
crm.86.a: "Something, at least."

crm.87.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Recognize Us!"
crm.87.d: "Our delegation was received rather coldly in [FROM.GetName]. Unfortunately for us, [FROM.GetName] refused to recognize us and provide any support towards our government."

crm.88.t: "[FROM.GetName] Wants to Join the Internationale"
crm.88.d: "With our recognition of the [FROM.GetAdjective] government, they have once again approached us, asking to join our alliance."
crm.88.a: "Let them in!"
crm.88.b: "Sorry, but no."

crm.89.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
crm.89.d: "Despite their promises, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government made it clear that it won't let us in their alliance, at least until Germany is defeated."
crm.89.a: "Sad to know."

crm.90.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Accused of Power Abuse"
crm.90.d: "Due to the government's recent funding of 'Shirket' agricultural community, headed by our current Prime-Minister, [ROOT.GetLeader], a group of delegates in the Qurultai, generally associated with a group of communists of Dmitriy Ulyanov, has accused our Prime-Minister of power abuse.\nTheir leader, Ismail Kerimjanov, "
crm.90.a: "Ignore them."
crm.90.b: "We must acknowledge our mistake and renounce support of Shirket."

crm.91.t: "A Sharp Rise in Support for Kerimjanov"
crm.91.d: "There has been a sharp increase of support for Kerimjanov' faction in the Crimean People's Council among the local population. Despite our best attempts and all the good that Shirket brings to people, as the largest agricultural organisation, the masses are being swept away from us by Kerimjanov's toxic propaganda. We must do something unless they will gain enough support to outnumber us in the Councils."
crm.91.a: "Arrest Kerimjanov and ban the KKP(b)!"
crm.91.b: "Raise governmental support for poorest peasants."
crm.91.c: "Ignore them altogether, they won't do anything."

crm.92.t: "The Crimean People's Council"
crm.92.d: "The recent reforms by Milliy Fırqa have resulted in a significant popularity of the local councils and decentralisation of the country. The workers and peasants form councils all over the peninsila and the government has initiated a transformation into a 'soviet' or council system. It is planned to dissolve the Qurultai and instead establish the Crimean People's Council, with delegates elected from the local councils all across the country."
crm.92.a: "A great idea!"
crm_92_a_tt: "§gKemalist§! faction of §HMilliy Fırqa§! won't like this."

crm.93.t: "Kerimjanov Arrested!"
crm.93.d: "With the clear order from the government, Ismail Kerimjanov was arrested as the former Bolshevik and is being held under arrest until further notice. The government is now beginning to search all the archives to find any evidence for Kerimjanov's crimes during the Bolshevik occupation of Crimea."
crm.93.a: "This traitor of the Crimean Tatar people definitely did something bad."

crm.94.t: "Slavic Workers' Strikes!"
crm.94.d: "The slavic workers, mainly the Russian ones are striking in the cities and the local Russian peasants are joining as well in various peasant riots all over the country. They demand immediate liberation of 'Political prisoners' and freedom to Kerimjanov, who is seen as the symbol of Tatar oppression. While their slogans are rather stupid, we will not release Kerimjanov and can just hope that the strikes will soon calm down."
crm.94.a: "At least this traitor is in jail!"

crm.95.t: "Elections to the Crimean People's Council"
crm.95.d: "With the Qurultai dissolved, it is high time to initiate elections to the Crimean People's Councils. While the Kemalists have split from our party and ignored the elections, another threat to our rule is approaching - Kerimjanov's faction of communists is quickly rising through ranks as the Russian majority of the peninsula is electing the Communist representatives in the local councils. If we won't do anything, there is a high chance that the Communists will outnumber us."
crm.95.a: "We should ban them from participation."
crm.95.b: "We should not do anything - we're a democracy, after all."

crm.96.t: "Elections to the Crimean People's Council"
crm.96.d.first: "The first convocation of the Crimean People's Council has been finally elected. Despite all scandals before the elections, the Milliy Fırqa has won the majority in the Council."
crm.96.d: "The elections to the Crimean People's Council have been held and now it is time to announce the winner. As before, Milliy Fırqa has secured a confident victory in the majority of the local councils."
crm.96.a: "A great victory!"

crm.97.t: "Elections to the Crimean People's Council"
crm.97.d: "The elections to the Crimean People's Council have been held and now it is time to announce the winner. Very unfortunately for the ruling Milliy Fırqa, the Crimean Communists under leadership of Ismail Kerimjanov have secured a surprise victory, suddenly rising to power thanks to the Slavic electorate and the dissapointed voters of Milliy Fırqa."
crm.97.a: "The Bolshevism is here again."

crm.98.t: "Restoration of German Land Tenure"
crm.98.d: "On February 3, 1915, the Russian State Duma issued a law on land tenure and land use in the Russian State, under which foreigners of German origin or their descendants were required to sell their real estate within two years. This law was declared the cornerstone in the struggle against German domination in Russia, and now we must return the estates and any other private property from those German families from whom it had been undeservedly taken.\n\nIn spite of a number of liberties on the part of the Ukrainian Power, many Germans have never regained their estates. But we will correct this vile injustice."
crm.98.a: "Seize these lands and hand them over to the Germans!"
crm.98.b: "We are not bloody Russians. Buy back these lands!"

crm.99.t: "Schwarzmeerdeutsche and the Kronkolonie"
crm.99.d: "Several decades ago, Pastor Immanuel Winkler, a spiritual leader among the Schwarzmeerdeutsche community, presented to Erich Ludendorff, first General Quartermaster of the Supreme Army Command, and government officials in Berlin in March 1918 an ambitious plan to broaden the horizons of the Kaiserreich - to establish the Crown Colony of Crimea-Taurida. Initially dismissed as unrealistic and costly in 1918, Winkler's vision seemed destined to fade into history with the passing of its advocate.\n\nHowever, a recent resurgence in national pride among the colony's inhabitants has prompted an influential member of the emerged the Kronkolonie's administration to revisit Winkler's grand idea and present them to [ROOT.GetLeader]. This member passionately argues that the time has come to unite the diverse Schwarzmeerdeutsche communities, which would promote regional growth and prosperity.\n\nThe Schwarzmeerdeutsche, descendants of German settlers from the 18th and 19th centuries, migrated to Crimea, Ukraine, and other territories in the Russian Empire, fleeing persecution and instability. By morphing their distinct cultural traditions and settlements, a stronger unified German presence in the region can be created.\n\nWhile the plan entails significant administrative and financial efforts for successful integration, the potential for a strong, cohesive German colony cannot be easily dismissed. With renewed vigor, we must now decide whether or not to pursue Winkler's grand vision and expand Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien to encompass the rich heritage of the Schwarzmeerdeutsche lands."
crm.99.a: "It is for Berlin to decide our fate."
crm.99.b: "Revive Winkler's proposal."
crm.99.c: "The costs of this ambitious project are too high."

crm.100.t: "The Expansion of Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien"
crm.100.d: "Pastor Immanuel Winkler's ambitious plan for a \"Crown Colony Crimea-Taurida\" may have faced rejection by German authorities back in 1918, but the idea has refused to fade away entirely. With the establishment of the Kronkolonie, there has been an increasing call for the expansion of the colony, attracting German immigrants, mostly the Schwarzmeerdeutsche, to settle the land and granting them German citizenship.\n\nThis renewed interest in Winkler's vision has been met with cautious excitement among some factions within the German Empire, as well as lingering skepticism from others who still remember the previous rejection of the proposal. They argue that the same concerns persist: whether Germany would truly be able to defend the colony in times of war.\n\nAs the debate continues, the Kaiser now faces a crucial decision: should they revive Winkler's plan and permit the expansion of the Crown Colony Crimea-Taurida, or remain steadfast in their previous stance, dismissing the proposal as impractical and unfeasible?"

crm.101.t: "Germany Accepts the Proposal"
crm.101.d: "News has reached the Crown Colony Crimea-Taurida that the Kaiser has officially accepted the proposal put forward by Pastor Immanuel Winkler in 1918, and renewed by our administration. The news has sparked great excitement among the German settlers in the colony, who see this as an opportunity to expand their presence in the region and strengthen their ties to the German Empire."
crm.101.a: "Long live the Kaiser!"

crm.102.t: "Germany Rejects the Proposal"
crm.102.d: "The Crown Colony Crimea-Taurida has received news that the Kaiser has once rejected Winkler's proposal for the expansion of the colony. The settlers in the colony are disappointed but not surprised, as they were aware that the German authorities had expressed reservations about the proposal.\n\nMany of the settlers had been hoping for the opportunity to fellow Germans joining them en-masse in the Crown Colony, but now those hopes have been dashed. The German government has not provided any financial assistance or incentives for the expansion, and the existing German community in the colony feels increasingly isolated and disconnected from the Empire.\n\nThere is a sense of frustration and disillusionment among the German settlers in the Crown Colony, who had believed that their presence in the region was valued and coveted by the German authorities. However, they are determined to persevere and continue building their new society, despite the lack of support from the government in Berlin."
crm.102.a: "The immigrants are still welcomed."

crm.103.t: "The Office of General-Governor"
crm.103.d: "The Colonial Administration has been considering a significant change in the governance of the Kronkolonie. As the Tatar resistance has been crushed as well as the colony develops and becomes more complex, it has become evident to many that a strong figurehead, a General-Governor (Generalgouverneur), could streamline its administration. The General-Governor would serve as the central authority governing the colony's affairs and ensuring its adherence to the German Empire's directives.\nProponents of this idea argue that by establishing the office of General-Governor, the colony's decision-making process would be more efficient, and it would enable quicker responses to the various challenges faced by Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien. However, critics claim that transferring power from the Colonial Administration to a single individual could foster corruption and undemocratic governance, leading to potential unrest within the colony.\nAs the debate rages on, the administration must now take a stand and confirm whether the office of General-Governor is to be established or if power will continue to be held solely by the Colonial Administration."
crm.103.a: "We need efficient and centralized governance."
crm.103.b: "Maintain the power of the Colonial Administration."

crm.104.t: "The Appointment of General-Governor"
crm.104.d: "Following extensive deliberations and evaluations of the pros and cons, the Colonial Administration has ultimately decided to establish the office of General-Governor for the Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien. With the decision made, it is now imperative to appoint the right person to serve as the first Generalgouverneur of the colony.\n\nCurrently, two esteemed candidates have been nominated for this integral role: Heinrich XXXIII Reuss of Köstritz himself, the existing and experienced leader of the Colonial Administration, and Woldemar (Vladimir) Falz-Fein, a well-respected and influential figure known for his deep understanding of local cultural and economic matters. Each candidate offers unique strengths and expertise that would undoubtedly bring valuable progress to the colony. This choice will determine the future direction of Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien and set the course for its administration."
crm.104.a: "Who needs change?"
crm.104.b: "Appoint Woldemar Falz-Fein as the first Generalgouverneur!"

crm.105.t: "Union der Krimdeutschen"
crm.105.d: "With the recent appointment of Woldemar Falz-Fein as the first Generalgouverneur of the Crown Colony Crimea-Taurida, there has been a surge of activity within the colony's political landscape. Falz-Fein, leveraging his newfound political status, has founded a new political organization known as the Union der Krimdeutschen (Union of Crimean Germans) or UKd, aiming to represent the interests of the German diaspora throughout Crimea and provide a united front for conservative values.\n\nThe Union der Krimdeutschen, boasting Falz-Fein as its leader, has already begun garnering support among the German-speaking population, as well as gaining favor with those who view the Generalgouverneur as a stabilizing force and authority figure. The organization seeks to promote German language and cultural initiatives, consolidate the German community's political influence, and maintain the status quo in terms of general governance, maintaining close ties with the German Empire's Colonial Administration.\n\nWhile the organization is perceived as a powerful force for the German population of Crimea, dissenting voices express concerns about the degree to which the UKd may centralize and marginalize non-German populations and interests. As the political landscape of Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien evolves, it remains to be seen how the Union der Krimdeutschen, led by Generalgouverneur Woldemar Falz-Fein, will impact the course of future events."
crm.105.a: "The civilian government is finally forming."

crm.1050.t: "Congress of the Crimean Directory"
crm.1050.d: "The initial recovery is over, and now it's time to sit down and focus on our internal affairs. The Extraordinary regional government of Krym wants to finally form a functioning, workable government for the next few years, but for this it is necessary to solve one main question - the question of our course\n\nThere are three main candidates for the position of the Crimean Prime-Minister. The first is Jafer Seidamet, an ideologue and one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar people in the initial period of the Civil War, Minister of War and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first government of the national hero of Crimea Noman Celebijikhan and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Sulkevich's Crimean Regional Government, until the resignation of the latter. In emigration in Turkey he became an ardent supporter of Kemal Attaturk's reforms and wants to pursue his Kemalist vision of Crimea, as a centralised and nationalist republic.\nThe second is Asan Sabri Ayvazov, former member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, a pedagogue and linguist, who was long in shadow of Jafer Seidamet. He was an ambassador of Sulkevich's Crimean Regional Government in Ottoman Empire and was twice the head of Crimean Tatar Qurultai. He wants to stick to the Milliy Fırqa's original Narodist-influenced ideology.\nThe third is Amet Ozenbashly, a candidate with a socialist bias in his views. He participated in the negotiations between the government of Sulkevich and the Hetman in 1918, and then did not emigrate and in 1920 became one of the founders of the agricultural organization \"Shirket\", which had branches in all regions of the Crimea and united members of the National Party. In addition, he became a member of the organization \"Koch Yardim\" (Assistance to Migrants), which aimed to create favorable conditions for the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and the Bulgarian Tsardom. Despite the fact that he stayed in Crimea after the occupation by Ukraine, it was only due to his patriotism and love for Crimea.\nThe Qurultai has been elected once again and now it is time to elect the new leader of the nation."
crm.1050.a: "Asan Sabri Ayvazov, status-quo candidate."
crm.1050.b: "Seidamet Jafer will be a good Prime-Minister."
crm.1050.c: "Crimea needs a more socialist-minded Prime-Minister."

crm.1051.t: "Restoration of the Khanate?"
crm.1051.d: "With the election of Seidamet Jafer, a greater voice was recevied by a small faction of Milliy Firqa, the Monarchists. They wish to restore the Crimean Khanate under the leadership of a pretender from the Giray dynasty, Sultan Kadyr Giray, a descendant of Genghis Khan and the ruling dynasty of the Crimean Khanate.\n\nRestoration of the Khanate in the form of a constitutional monarchy will likely strengthen our ties with the Ottoman Empire. On the other hand, a lot of forces within Milliy Fırqa are against it, including Seidamet himself, though he will accept the party's decision, as he mentioned before the Qurultai members."
crm.1051.a: "Restore our state to greatness!"
crm.1051.b: "We building a modern state, no need to return back to 1700s."

crm.106.t: "The Flag For Our Nation"
crm.106.d: "Since the time of the first Crimean People's Republic, an ordinary light blue canvas has been considered the national flag, however, the Directory believes that it is necessary to give the main national symbol some special features.\n\nThe first option is to add a yellow tamga of the Giray dynasty to the upper left corner, referring us to our great past.\n\nThe second option is to add a yellow stripe in the middle so that yellow and light blue officially symbolize our Crimean Tatar identity."
crm.106.a: "First choice better represents us."
crm.106.b: "We are fine with the second choice."
crm.106.c: "Why do you think the Light Blue Banner is bad?"

crm.107.t: "The End of Play"
crm.107.d: "As Jafer Seidamet's authority grew over time, for now there is no doubt among his cabinet that a strong executive is absolutely needed. A special reform, considering giving much more power to the head of government is already been pushed to the Qurultai, and successfully adopted by our parliament members.\n\nFrom this day, the head of government will have additional powers, such as right to veto the bills and dissolve the Qurultai. While the oppositional members of our party has been very critical of this legislation, we had the necessary majority."
crm.107.a: "Towards Unity!"

crm.108.t: "The Opposition Unites!"
crm.108.d: "The oppositional deputies, outraged by the decision to empower our head of government have now united against us. The split in the party is now more than evident and the oppositional deputies have formed the united frong against 'authoritarianism'.\n\nWith the schism now evident, the pro-governmental deputies, led by Seidamet have announced their separation from the Milliy Firqa and establishment of their own party. Under the name of Tatar People's Party, clearly a reference to the Milliy Firqa's own name, once it was formed, the new party is now at the nation's leadership, doubted only by the oppositional deputies."
crm.108.a: "Why when someone calls for unity, everything falls apart?!"

crm.109.t: "Kemalists Split!"
crm.109.d: "For too long our party was united in our struggle for nation's independence. However, as Jafer Seidamet's faction become strongly opposition to us, the split has been only severing. With the Council of People's Deputies finally established, the leftist bias of the party was strongly criticized by Seidamet, whose final word was to split and establish a new, oppositional party. Under the name of Tatar People's Party, which is clearly a reference to the Milliy Firqa's early days, the Kemalists, Nationalists and Monarchists have united against our rule. Whether this split will become catastrophic to the nation's unity is yet to be discovered."
crm.109.a: "Is this an end for Milliy Fırqa unity?"

crm.110.t: "Qurultai [GetYear] Elections"
crm.110.d: "Our legislative Qurultai of the Crimean Tatar People, also known as the Tatar Parliament, is ending its current convocation and the general elections are being called. Soon, we will know the winner."
crm.110.a: "The Kemalists win the majority!"
crm.110.b: "Milliy Fırqa secures its positions"
crm.110.c: "Victory of the Left"

crm.111.t: "Restoration of the Monarchy?"
crm.111.d: "With our current Kemalist course, various politicians and members of our faction have suggested to restore the Crimean Monarchy - with the pretender to the throne, Sultan Kadyr, from the House of Giray, as its figurehead. While the other, republican faction, believes that there are no preconditions for the restoration of Monarchy, the return of Khanate will please our Ottoman partners and also help us to strengthen our rule.\nThe main objective to the restoration is, however, the Qurultai. If we manage to lobby some members of the opposition, we will manage to pass the Restoration Bill."
crm.111.a: "Qurultai passes the Restoration Bill!"
crm.111.b: "The Qurultai is against restoration!"

crm.112.t: "[FROM.GetName] Seeks Further Cooperation"
crm.112.d: "With the [FROM.GetName] finally feeling strong enough, they have declared strengthening ties between our countries and ask for further cooperation and support."
crm.112.a: "We'd rather not."
crm.112.b: "Of course!"

crm.113.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
crm.113.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our efforts to increase cooperation between our states. It seems that we have to rely on ourselves alone."
crm.113.a: "How foolish of them!"

crm.114.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggests Alliance"
crm.114.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has proposed to join our alliance. With our ambitions we believe that Crimea should become a part of Russia, though we can accept them in our alliance as an independent nation for now."
crm.114.a: "Reject them."
crm.114.b: "Accept them!"

crm.115.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
crm.115.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has rejected us! It seems that they find our participation in their alliance as not very desirable, and sees us as their rightful territory."
crm.115.a: "It seems we should await Russian conquest."

crm.116.t: "A New Flag?"
crm.116.d: "Together with proclamation of the Federation of Crimean Peoples we have adopted the new flag, but some of our politicians believe that we should adopt another version. Current flag uses the outline of the Crimean peninsula with four stars, representing four main nationalities of our country: Crimean Tatars, Russians, Ukrainians and Karaites. There are also two stripes: red in the upper part of the banner and yellow in the lower one.\n\nWe can adopt another flag, which will have only red stripes or another one, which will have only yellow stripes."
crm.116.a: "Current flag best represents our federation."
crm.116.b: "We should adopt the one with red stripes."
crm.116.c: "We should adopt the one with yellow stripes."

crm.117.t: "Crimea Needs Water!"
crm.117.d: "Since the independence of Crimea, it has been cut off from the mainland, and, accordingly, water. Since ancient times, Crimea has been a rather arid region, and now their government is faced with a serious shortage of water resources, which, according to the old project of H.H.Steven, they want to put on the peninsula by building the North Crimean Canal from the Dnieper.\n\nTo build this canal, they will need not only access to the Dnieper, but also that we will have to invest in this project and build our part of the canal on the territory of the Tauride District.\n\nTheir plan looks like complete madness, but the lack of water can turn into a major environmental and humanitarian disaster for Crimeans, among whom there are many Ukrainians."
crm.117.a: "Now they realize that they can't exist without us."
crm.117.b: "They should not have left us, to be fair."

crm.118.t: "Ukraine Agreed!"

crm.118.a: "Glad we did this!"

crm.119.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
crm.119.d: "The bloodthirsty and merciless Ukrainian state has put its political hysteria above the health of millions of people! They refused to sign a contract with us on the construction of a vital canal!"

We can put pressure on our allies and force them to build a canal, or, if they refuse, invest their funds to build a canal."

crm.144.t: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap] [GetYear] Constitution"
crm.144.d: "When the first Crimean Republic adopted the constitution in 1917, it, of course, was largely incomplete and imperfect. Now that our independence is guaranteed, the Qurultai has gathered to draft a draft version of the new constitution in order to outline its main derivatives.\n\nFortunately, the government has already decided on both the foreign policy and the internal course that the free and independent Crimean state will follow, and therefore the basic political values, rights and obligations of citizens will be fixed today. In the future, amendments will be adopted to the current constitution, which will correct it and update it."
crm.144.a: "Great!"

crm.145.t: "The Krymkaraylar"
crm.145.d: "Our small, yet multinational country is a home not only to Orthodox Slavs and Muslim Crimean Tatars, but some other ethnicities as well, including the non-Rabbinic Judaism adherents, the Crimean Karaites, or Krymkaraylar, as they call themselves. Having a small minority in Poland and Lithuania as well, the Karaites are putting much effort into recreation of their culture and traditions, mainly thanks to Seraya Shapshal, the leader of European Karaite Society. With the Federation finally coming true, the question arose if the Karaites should be given greater autonomy and representation in the Qurultai."
crm.145.a: "Karaites should be equalized in every public sphere with other nations."
crm.145.b: "Let them stay a small, yet proud minority."

crm.146.t: "The Karaite Insurgency"
crm.146.d: "Almost immediately after the decision to make only one language the state language, a few but effective rallies of Karaites - the local Turkic-speaking population professing non-Rabbinic Judaism - began to take place throughout the peninsula. Their language is in many ways similar to Crimean Tatar and perhaps we should legitimize it, at least in schools in areas where the majority are Karaites."
crm.146.a: "Actually... Karaite language is almost similar to ours."
crm.146.b: "Our languages are similar, they will learn Qirimtatarca soon!"

crm.147.t: "Karaites Take Over!"
crm.147.d: "Our refusal to recognize the Crimean Karaite language, that is, to give at least some level of autonomy to the Karaites, led to the fact that their religious leader, Seraya Shapshal, was able to gather a protest rally of thousands in Bakhchisarai, which soon turned into armed clashes between our guard and the militia.\n\nIn the end, quite unexpectedly, Crimeans joined the Karaites, as well as many representatives of Slavic peoples, demanding the overthrow of our government. Despite the fact that we completely refused all the demands of the protesters, they were able to break into the Bakhchisarai Palace, where the Qurultai was sitting and arrest the Prime Minister.\n\nSeraya Shapshal announced the creation of the Crimean Karaite State and the assumption of the post of acting Prime Minister, as well as the delegation of broad powers to the interim government in the person of his inner circle from the 'Khazarian Revival Society'"
crm.147.a: "Glory days of our past will return!"

crm.148.t: "Slavic Workers Strike!"
crm.148.d: "Our measures on preferences for Tatar workers have not gone unnoticed. Already today, some factories have been closed due to strikes staged by Slavic workers demanding equal rights with Crimean Tatars. In addition to raising wages, they also require additional days off, which, in fact, Tatars need in connection with religious traditions. We can meet the demands of the workers so as not to aggravate the situation, or simply ignore their demands."
crm.148.b: "Ignore them."
crm.148.a: "Give up to their demands"

crm.149.t: "Crimean Soviet Republic!"
crm.149.d: "Our arrogance and disregard for the problems of the Russian- and Ukrainian-speaking working class led to the fact that soon most of the already few factories in our country stopped working. By uniting, Ukrainians and Russians were able to organize themselves into a certain mass, which demanded more and more.\n\nAt some point, a leader appeared among the strikers, who sharply won the sympathy of ordinary hard workers. This man turned out to be Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov - the brother of Vladimir Lenin himself! It turned out that Dmitry has been living incognito in Crimea for a long time due to his great love for the local flora, fauna and climate. Now, having become the head of the uprising of the Crimean workers, he declared solidarity with all the Crimean peoples, because the nationalism of our government is just a relic of the bourgeois past.\n\nSoon, Bakhchisarai fell, then Simferopol, our government was arrested, and in its place the Council of Simferopol Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies was formed, headed by Dmitry Ulyanov."

crm.152.d: "The Chairman of the KKP(b), Dmitriy Ulyanov, believes that in order to succeed in Revolution and spread it across all territories of the former Russian Empire, it is necessary to follow the exact sequence of actions committed by Lenin in October 1917.\n\nMoreover, as Ulyanov believes, the adopted decrees should really work, not only in words."
crm.152.a: "Let's begin."

crm.153.t: "The Decree on Peace"
crm.153.d: "The decree with which Lenin's path began was the decree on peace! It was an unprecedented symbol of his kindness and desire for peace and a quiet life for workers and peasants! He proclaimed the goal of the new government to renounce secret diplomacy and immediately conclude 'a just, democratic peace' 'without annexations and indemnities' by 'all warring nations and their governments', "Despite the fact that peace could not be achieved then, we can do it here and right now sign peace with all hostile countries.\n\nToday, by its decree, the Crimean Soviet authorities declared peace on the entire territory of the republic and the cessation of all hostilities, and also called on all other countries to do so."
crm.153.a: "We need peace on our Earth very much!"

crm.154.t: "The Decree on Land"
crm.154.d: "The most important decree adopted shortly after the revolution in October 1917 was the decree on land. We intend to repeat his points, and give all the land to the peasants!\n\n1) The landowner's ownership of land is immediately abolished without any redemption.\n2) The landlords' estates, as well as all the appanage, monastery, church lands with all their living and dead inventory, manor buildings and all accessories, are transferred to the disposal of the volost land Committees and county Councils of Peasant Deputies until the Constituent Assembly.\n3) Any damage to the confiscated property belonging to the whole people is now declared a grave crime punishable by a revolutionary court...\n4) To guide the implementation of the great land reforms, until their final decision, the Constituent Assembly should everywhere serve the following peasant mandate...\n5) The land of ordinary Cossacks and peasants is not confiscated."
crm.154.a: "No more landowners!"

crm.155.t: "Krymskaya Pravda"
crm.155.d: "In the grave decisive hour of the coup and the days immediately following it, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee was forced to take a number of measures against the counter-revolutionary press of various shades. Immediately, cries arose from all sides that the new socialist government had thus violated the basic principle of its program by encroaching on the freedom of the press.\nThe Workers' and Peasants' Government draws attention to the fact that in our society, behind this liberal screen, freedom for the propertied classes is actually hidden, having seized the lion's share of the entire press into their hands, it is not forbidden to poison the minds and bring confusion into the consciousness of the masses. Everyone knows that the bourgeois press is one of the powerful weapons of the bourgeoisie. Especially at critical moments, when the new power, the power of the workers and peasants, is only being consolidated, it was impossible to completely leave these weapons in the hands of the enemy at a time when they are no less dangerous at such moments than bombs and machine guns. That is why temporary and emergency measures were taken to curb the flow of dirt and slander, in which the yellow and green press would willingly drown the young victory of the people.\nAs soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative influences on the press will be stopped, complete freedom will be established for it within the limits of responsibility before the court, according to the broadest and most progressive law in this regard. Taking into account, however, that the constraint of the press, even at critical moments, is permissible only within the limits absolutely necessary. The Council of People 's Commissars decides:\n\n1. Only press bodies are subject to closure:\n1) calling for open resistance or disobedience to the Workers' and Peasants' government;\n2) sowing confusion by clearly slanderous distortion of facts;\n3) calling for acts of a clearly criminal, i.e. criminally punishable nature.\n2. Press bans, temporary or permanent, are carried out only by resolution of the Council of People's Commissars.\n3. This provision is temporary and will be abolished by a special decree upon the onset of normal conditions of public life.\n\nChairman of the Council of People's Commissars\nDmitry Ulyanov (Lenin)"

crm.156.d: "The All-Crimean Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies decides:\n\nCreate a provisional workers' and Peasants' government, known as the Council of People's Commissars. The management of certain branches of state activity is entrusted to the commissions, whose members must ensure the implementation of the program announced by the Congress and work in close contact with mass organizations of men and women -workers, sailors, soldiers, peasants and employees. State power is vested in the collegium of the chairmen of these commissions, i.e. the Council of People's Commissars.\n\nControl over the activities of People's commissars with the right to replace them is entrusted to the All-Crimean Congress of Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies and its Central Executive Committee."
crm.156.a: "True proletarian power!"

crm.157.t: "The Decree on Social Insurance"
crm.157.d: "The Crimean proletariat has placed on its banners "Full social insurance of employees", as well as the urban and rural poor. The Hetman government of the landlords and capitalists and the Crimean Tatar nationalist bourgeoisie were unable to meet the demands of the workers in this regard.\nThe Workers' and Peasants' Government, with the support of the Council of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, announces to the working class of Crimea, the urban and rural poor, that it will immediately prepare decrees on social insurance in accordance with the ideas of the workers.\n\n1. Insurance for all employees without exception, as well as for the urban and rural poor.\n2. Insurance to cover all forms of disability, such as illness, injury, disability, old age, motherhood, widowhood, orphanhood, and unemployment.\n3. The total cost of insurance that the employer must bear.\n4. Full compensation in case of disability or unemployment.\n5. The insured must have full control over the insurance institutions.\n\nOn behalf of the Government of the Crimean Republic,\nD. ULYANOV (LENIN)"

crm.158.t: "Power to the Toilers!"
crm.158.d: "Comrade Toilers! Remember that you yourself are now running the government. Unless you get together and take all affairs of the government into your own hands, no one will do it for you. Your Soviets are from now on all-powerful and all-decisive organs of government. Rally around your Soviets. Strengthen them. Take matters into your hands and don't wait for anyone to tell you what to do. Insist on the strictest revolutionary order.\nOrganize strict control over production and accountability for the products. Bring before the revolutionary tribunal everyone who dares to harm the cause of the people by sabotaging (spoiling, hindering, destroying) in industry, concealing grain and produce, interfering with transportation of grain, tearing up rail, post, and telegraph lines, or in other ways opposing the great cause of peace, of transferring the land to the peasants, and of assuming workers' control over production and distribution.\nComrade workers, soldiers, peasants, and all toilers! Take all local power into your own hands. Take and guard as the apple of your eye the grain, factories, implements, products, and transport--all these are from now on wholly yours; they are public property.\nGradually, with the approval and agreement of the majority of the peasants, guided by their practical experience and that of the workers, we shall move on firmly and resolutely to the victory of socialism, a victory which the advance guard of the workers of the more civilized countries will make secure and which is bound to give the people a lasting peace and freedom from all oppression and exploitation.\n\nD.

crm.159.a: "Sure!"
crm.159.b: "No!"

crm.160.t: "The Khazars"
crm.160.d: "For a long time, the Karaites were considered completely ordinary Jews who professed another branch of Judaism and who rejected Talmudic principles. However, since when the Crimea was annexed into Russia, the new theory has been developing not only in the hearts and souls of our people, but in the scientific circles as well. Today, with Seraya Shapshal's theory becoming more and more popular, we understand clearly our ancestry.\n\nWe are the descendants of the Khazars - a once-mighty group of Turkic Tatars that ruled a khanate that once spanned from Ukraine to Central Asia. Though our faith may be different and our traditions slightly altered, we are their descendants, and their glories as our glories. However, that also means the burden is now on us to untarnish their legacy and lead our shared Turkic race to glory.  We have much to do to revive the Khazaric traditions and finally get rid of any rabbinic influence that has been spreading into Crimea."
crm.160.a: "The truth has triumphed"

crm.161.t: "Shapshal's Doctrine of Dejudaization of Karaism"
crm.161.d: "Although we, the Karaites, and our religion are Jewish by faith, we are in no way ethnic Jews. We are not Ashkenazim or Sephardim, we are Turks, descendants of the Khazars!\n\nAccording to the doctrine of de-judicization of karaites by Seraya Shapshal, all the influence of Jewish ethnicity and non-Turkic culture should be eliminated from our religion and our identity so that we can be our own, unique and unsurpassed peoples. And despite the fact that this process may take a long time, we must begin the main transformations now - and the next generation of Karaites will never remember their false Jewish origin.\n\nAmong the main postulates of this doctrine, Shapshal singled out the following:\nKaraites are the indigenous ethnic group of the Crimea, which existed long before they adopted the teachings of Anan ben David.\nThe teachings of Anan ben David were close to early Christianity, and Jesus and Muhammad Karaites were considered prophets from time immemorial. The Karaites of Crimea adopted the law of Moses, but continued to adhere to ancient Turkic pagan beliefs."
crm.161.a: "Finally we have understood this."

crm.162.t: "Replacing the Names of Holidays and Months"
crm.162.d: "Within the framework of the doctrine of de-Judaization, it is necessary to Turkify the Karaite population, therefore Shapshal proposed to start by renaming traditional holidays from Hebrew roots to Turkic ones.\n\nFrom this day, the new names were adopted. 'Pesach' changes to Tymbyl Chydžy, 'the Post of the 9th Tammuz' - to Burunhu Oruč, 'Shavuot' - to Aftalar Chydzy, and others. Moreover, the new celebration was introduced in order to symbolize the beginning of the year - Jyl Bašy."
crm.162.a: "That will definitely spread Turkification policies!"

crm.163.t: "Our Bygone Religion"
crm.163.d: "One of the unique features of the doctrine of our great leader-reformer is the return of the great traditions of the pagan past of the Karaites-Khazars.\n\nThe relics of the archaic Karaite cults date back to paganism, shamanism, and Tengrianism. Although, according to Shapshal, "the Karaite clergy managed to transform the worldview of their co-religionists for a number of centuries," it is the ancient cults that are the original cultural heritage of the Crimean Karaites, requiring study, preservation and restoration. Among the native Karaite rituals to be restored: the cult of sacred oaks, ostrich eggs as a talisman and others.\n\nIn the near future, it is planned to restore the veneration of Sacred oaks, restore some pagan holidays and give them the features of traditional Karaite culture."
crm.163.a: "Interesting"

crm.164.t: "Militarization of Karaite History"
crm.164.d: "Militarization should occupy a significant place in Karaite history. Seraya Shapshal described in detail and stated the facts that the ancient Karaites were great warriors who served in the Polish-Lithuanian and Hetman army. Traces of the military history of the Karaites are reflected in the national symbols, including senek ('two-horned spear') and kalkan (shield).\n\nThe militarization of Karaite history also includes giving the theory of the great Karaite commander, Prince Elyaga Uzun official status, as well as the Karaite origin of the Pereyaslav colonel of the Zaporozhye Host, Ilyash Karaimovich.\n\nWith the publication of these facts, Seraya Shapshal hopes for the development of a sense of patriotism and nationality among our people and their readiness for a war for the revival of the great Khazaria."
crm.164.a: "We have always been warriors!"

crm.165.t: "Abolition of Hebrew Teaching in Schools"
crm.165.d: "Within the framework of the doctrine of de-Judaization of the Karaites, Seraya Shapshal abolished the teaching of Hebrew in schools, replacing it with the study of his native language - Crimean-Karaite. In addition, the Torah and other important documents were translated into the Karaite language, and the Karaite language became the official language in Crimea for political and public events, not counting events organized by other autonomies."
crm.165.a: "Speak Qirimkaraylar language!"

crm.166.t: "The Gakhan of the Khazaria"
crm.166.d: "The completion of the doctrine of de-Judaization of the Karaites was the official proclamation of the Seray Shapshal as the Gakhan of the Crimean Karaites and the new ruler of the Khazar Khaganate (Gakhanate).\n\nReplacing the word 'gakham' with the Turkic 'Gakhan', Shapshal seeks to emphasize the Turkic origin of the Karaites, because 'gakhan' etymologically comes from the Khazar 'kagan'. Despite the fact that Shapshal has long called himself Gakhan, today it was officially confirmed.\n\nIn addition, the Crimean state officially became known as the Khazar Khaganate, which allowed our leader to declare the revival of the great empire of the past."
crm.166.a: "The Khazaria has been revived!"

crm.167.t: "Legacy of Solomon Krym"
crm.167.d: "The national father of our independent Crimea, as well as a fellow Karaite, Solomon Krym, is perhaps the greatest modern figure of Crimea. He also sadly passed away, but this does not mean that his legacy should end there. Although he was not enthusiastic about our nationalist movement, the public does not need to know this. We will perceive Krym as the first Karaite hero of our time and a martyr, the herald of our new destiny. He will become a national hero of Crimea, and his image and legacy will become ideal tools that the state can use to win over the masses, because he was a man who united our people against foreign enemies and serious threats like no other."
crm.167.a: "The legacy of Solomon shall never perish!"

crm.168.t: "Denounce Rabbinic Judaism"
crm.168.d: "Although the Karaites technically descend from a rabbinic sect, we are in no way connected with their heretical ideas, despite our proximity to the Crimean Jews of Crimea. Although we would never harm our fellow Jews, we hereby officially condemn rabbinic Judaism and renounce any and all rabbinic ties, for our refined, purified and uniquely Turkic Karaite Judaism is the only true Jewish faith.\n\nOur proclamation has already become the object of fierce public discussion in Europe, especially among the Ashkenazi population, and many social movements demanded explanations from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which once again had to explain that there is nothing anti-Semitic or reprehensible in their actions, but only a statement of the fact of the Karaite past."
crm.168.a: "We determine our own destiny"

crm.169.t: "The Issue of Krymchaks"
crm.169.d: "Our fellow Crimeans profess Rabbinic Judaism, and in this regard, the question of their religious and national affiliation has become acute. Despite their small number (less than 1,000 people), the government proposes to create special conditions for the Crimeans so that they can preserve their national, ethnic and religious affiliation in the conditions of the new Kaganate. We can grant them autonomy and the opportunity to live according to their traditional customs, or simply leave everything as it is, which may lead to the speedy extinction of their people or assimilation."
crm.169.a: "We shall grant them autonomy."
crm.169.b: "Everything shall stay as it is."

crm.170.t: "[FROM.GetName] Funds Karaite Minority"
crm.170.d: "Since ancient times, a large Tatar diaspora has lived in Lithuania, professing Karaism and coming from the lands of the Crimea. Now that the Karaites have become dominant on their territory and announced the creation of a new Khazar Khaganate, we learned that they actively sponsor the Karaite Lithuanian communities. Despite the fact that these actions are aimed at supporting the Karaite people, and are not aimed at any military and separatist sentiments, we can cut off these ties for our security."
crm.170.a: "Stop their funding!"
crm.170.b: "Perhaps, this will do no harm to us"

crm.171.t: "True Ashkenazi Origins"
crm.171.d: "Today we have become the object of state propaganda of the Khazar Khaganate, which began to distribute mainly among the numerous Ashkenazi population an article about the true origin of the Ashkenazim.\n\nTheir theory postulated that Ashkenazi Jews were primarily, or to a large extent, descended from Khazars, a multi-ethnic conglomerate of mostly Turkish people who formed a semi-nomadic khanate in and around the northern and central Caucasus and the Pontic–Caspian steppe.\n\nOf course, we understand that their propaganda is undoubtedly aimed at attracting our Jewish population to new lands in the Crimea, and we need to attract experts as soon as possible and publish official statements about the failure of their theory."
crm.171.a: "Madness!"

crm.172.t: "True Cossack Origins"
crm.172.d: "The Khazar Khaganate began to spread propaganda among our population about the true origin of the Cossacks. According to their theory, the origin of the Cossacks is exclusively Khazar, and that the Khazars were also a Slavic people. Despite the inconsistency of this theory, it began to gain popularity among our population and even gave rise to slogans about unification with the Khazar Khaganate.\n\nWe must officially renounce this theory or leave everything as it is, hoping for the consciousness of our people."

crm.181.d: "Fighting back against Ukrainian defense forces and internal ethnic violence, the diverse seperatist groups of Crimea have held their ground, and after much blood was spilled on the Perekop Isthmus, an independent Crimea now stands alone. Not since Russia consumed the peninsula in 1783, breaking the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca after decades of tense relations and conflicts with the Ottomans, has Crimea been free, and now with the myriad peoples of the peninsula all breathing free air, the future of Crimea has never been more wide-open. As the newly independent state now settles its new foundations, the world looks to this small but vital hold on the Black Sea with curious eyes, for the people of Crimea claim to have big plans - even while the Ukrainians, Russians, and other opportunistic forces already begin to circle Crimea like hungry wolves."

crm.182.t: "The Crimean Khanate Rises Once More"
crm.182.d: "Once known to the wider world as ‘Little Tartary,’ the Crimean Khanate has risen once again. Finally snuffed from existence in 1783 after the Russians marched into the peninsula and took Crimea for themselves, the Khanate stood for over 300 years before that with the aid of their Ottoman allies. As if history was destined to repeat itself, the Ottomans once again moved to tie themselves to the newly independent Crimea, and now, as if it were 1441, the Great Horde and Desht-i Kipchak rises again from the ashes of their old civilization. With the Khanate restored, the Crimeans have reaffirmed their centuries-old alliance with the Sultan of Islambol, and now together they seek to lead the Crimean Tatars to greatness."

crm.183.t: "Lenin...Lives?!"
crm.183.d: "As if it were 1917 all over again, an Ulyanov has risen to lead the Russian Proletariat, but this time not from inside the center of the Russian Empire. Instead, it would seem that the newly independent state of Crimea has become the new heart of Bolshevik fervor, and a new vanguard of the Proletariat has risen to fill the shoes of the late Vladimir Lennin - and who better to take his place than his own brother! Standing as the new Premier of the Crimean Soviet Republic, Dmitri Ilyich Ulyanov - the younger brother to Vladamir Ilyich Ulyanov ‘Lenin’ - has announced his plans to restart the Russian Revolution, finishing what his beloved brother could not. Issuing the Great Decrees once more and rallying the disparate Crimeans to his side, many call Dmitri a madman grasping at old glories, but perhaps this aging revolutionary is the second-coming the Bolsheviks truly need. Nothing is for certain, though the world’s eyes are now glued to this tiny peninsula to see what transpires next."

crm.184.d: "Rising from the ashes like a phoenix reborn, the Khazar Khaganate stands anew on the Crimean Peninsula, ready to spread the one, true faith of Karaite Judaism to the old lands of Khazaria. Casting off their Rabbinic heritage and the Zionist notions of their distant relatives the Asheknazi, the Karaites have embraced their ‘true’ heritage has children of the Khazars, and now seek to restore the old khaganate to its former glories while united under the Karaite faith. Though many have called them zealots and heretics driven on by dubious historical accounts and false delusions of grandeur, the Karaites stand proud and poised to retake the lands of their supposed ancestors. For now, however, the world shall watch and wait to see what these strange Jews do next."

The reserve plays an essential role in preserving the unique biodiversity and ecosystem of the region, thanks to its vast array of flora and fauna, as well as the discipline of its researchers and conservationists.\n\nRecognized as a gem of Tauride, the reserve holds a special connection to the Falz-Fein family. Friedrich Falz-Fein, Woldemar's brother, was instrumental in the development of the Askania-Nova Reserve, which is a testament to the family's commitment to environmental protection and the sustainable coexistence of human activities with nature. With his position as leader of the Union der Krimdeutschen and Generalgouverneur, Woldemar Falz-Fein has continued this legacy of environmental stewardship, pledging to allocate funds and support for the maintenance, protection, and development of the reserve.\n\nThis gesture of sustainable development and commitment to conservation is primarily greeted with applause from the local Tauride community. However, some of the Kolonie officials express concerns about potential resources being diverted towards the nature reserve rather than being utilized to strengthen their community and bolster German-centric initiatives."

With his passion and determination, Eduard proudly represented Ukraine at the 1936 Riga Winter Olympics, gaining admiration and respect from his fellow competitors and spectators alike.\n\nAfter the German occupation of Crimea, Eduard made the difficult decision to move to Berlin, where he continued to perfect his skills within the sport. Now, he has been selected to join the prestigious German bobsledding team to represent the country in the forthcoming Winter Olympics.\n\nNews of Eduard's inclusion in the German team has been met with widespread enthusiasm and excitement.

crm.187.t: "The Future Capital of the Kronkolonie: Neusatz"
crm.187.d: "The German colonial administration has recently proposed an ambitious plan to make the quaint village of Neusatz the new capital city of the Kronkolonie. Historically significant, Neusatz was founded in 1804 by 38 courageous colonist families from Württemberg, Alsace, Bavaria, and Baden. As a thriving German Lutheran community and one of the mother colonies of Crimean Germans, Neusatz holds a special place in the hearts of German settlers in the region.\n\nAdvocates for the proposal assert that establishing Neusatz as the capital will not only honor and preserve its rich cultural heritage but also serve as a beacon of German unity and determination. By celebrating this historic village, a renewed sense of pride and solidarity can be fostered among the local population and further strengthen the German presence in the region.\n\nNews of the proposal has sparked excitement and anticipation among the people of Neusatz and the surrounding areas. As discussions continue, the village eagerly awaits the decision that could transform its future and solidify its place in the annals of German colonial history."

crm.300.d: "While the storm of civil war rages in Ukraine, we can concentrate on the defense of the peninsula. And even though the Ukrainians are not yet seeking to invade Crimea, we must be prepared for the fact that whoever wins and sits in Kyiv will come here to take our freedom from us."

crm.301.t: "The Crimean Directory"
crm.301.d: "Using the chaotic situation in Ukraine, the Crimean Tatars, mainly the Milliy Firqa party, have organized themselves into the so-called Crimean Dyrektoria in order to represent the interests of the Crimean Tatars. Moreover, they have rallied the locals to unite against us and declared their independence from Ukraine! While they are weak for now, we cannot declare war on them due to the logistical issues and for now we have lost Crimea!"

CRM_Move_Into_Tauria_desc: "Time is of the essence with how volitile the situation in Crimea has become and we cannot allow ourselves a moment of dely. We must move the majority of our troops to secure the Isthmus of Perekop and the lands beyond it, known as Taurida or Tauria."

CRM_Crush_Local_Rebels: "Crush the Vile Separatists"
CRM_Crush_Local_Rebels_desc: "All across our Crimea, verminous traitors and seperatist minorities fight our forces in a futile resistance. Though they are disorganized, they have proven to be a thorn in our side for far too long. We should shift our attention to crushing this separatist insurgency, for as soon as we rout the bastards, the rebellion will end and peace will return to our Crimea."
CRM_A_Deal_With_Tatars: "A Deal With Tatars"
CRM_A_Deal_With_Tatars_desc: "It is a simple reality that we cannot ever hope to win against the grand mobilization of the native Tatar population. That is exactly why the commanders of our interventionary force have called on the Prince to send emissaries to the Tatar leaders in hopes of negotiating a treaty that would still be favourable to us."
CRM_Fate_Of_Administration: "Fate of the German Administration"
CRM_Fate_Of_Administration_desc: "With the immediate threats to the stability of the region dealt with, be it by force or coertion, nothing more remains but to determine what shall be the future of our humble garrison."

CRM_Die_Kronkolonie: "Die Kronkolonie Krim-Taurien"
CRM_Die_Kronkolonie_desc: "Just as the story of a simple garrison ends, the journey of a true German colony begins. With the formal decision to establish a new state in a vital area, which both the Ukrainians and Tatars have proven to be incapable of ruling properly, our administration has made it clear that it is here to stay, forever."

## German Focus Tree ##

GER_Consolidate_Power: "Consolidate German Authority"
GER_Consolidate_Power_desc: "A colony without proper institutions is bound to fall into anarchy, which cannot happen after so much effort that was already put towards establishing the former garrison as permanent. We shall turn what was basically a detachment of a proper army meant for an intervention into a true state, governed by laws and order."
GER_Request_Arms_From_Berlin: "Requests Arms From Berlin"
GER_Request_Arms_From_Berlin_desc: "Despite the series of victories over all the forces that tried to dislodge us, we cannot forget that our security is rather temporary. We should, no we have to contact Berlin this instant to secure valuable shipments of guns, munitions and vehicles to guard this vulnerable peninsula."
GER_Request_Arms_From_Berlin_tt: "Completing §H$CRM_Rifle_Acquisition$§! National Focus will give us more equipment."
GER_Change_Hryvnia_With_Mark: "Hryvnias Into Marks"
GER_Change_Hryvnia_With_Mark_desc: "Since our administration has previously been mostly focused on military matters, the local populations and even the civilians that have slowly started to trickle in from Germany continue to use Ukrainian Hryvnias. That will simply not do anymore, even if monetary conversion is never easy. To ensure that our economy is properly integrated into the wider Mitteleuropean block and the fatherland itself Crimea has to adopt the Goldmark."
GER_Cooperate_With_Natives: "Cooperate With Natives"
GER_Cooperate_With_Natives_desc: "If the wish of some of the most radical members of the intervention were to be followed, we would quickly run out of German men to staff all the needed offices. This is exactly why we have to cooperate with all the willing local native collaborators. In fact, their support will slowly but surely help to lighten our image in the eyes of the population that we now rule."

GER_Revert_1915_Land_Law_Russia: "Revert 1915 Landowning Act"
GER_Revert_1915_Land_Law_Russia_desc: "In 1915, while the Weltkrieg was still ongoing, the Russian Imperial Duma voted to introduce a law which main aim and target was the expropriation of the German colonists in the South of the Russian Empire. Many honest families were hurt by a move fueled by unchristian spite against our blood and kin. With the garrison's rule secured the time has come to reverse that decision and mend the damage caused by the will of the now long-rotting tsar."

GER_A_Base_To_Guard_Allies: "A Base To Guard Our Allies"
GER_A_Base_To_Guard_Allies_desc: "Thanks to the special geographic location Crimea finds itself in, our newly secured lands provide the perfect base of operations. We can easily counter any hostile Russian actions, especially with our domination of the Black Sea, while also easily supporting our Eastern allies. The colony shall be the Reichspakt's strongest soldier, given that we shall receive its hardest battles."
GER_Develop_Colonial_Settlements: "Develop Colonial Settlements"
GER_Develop_Colonial_Settlements_desc: "Germans will never be truly 'at home' in our new colony unless they have a place which they can call as such. While many villages were abandoned in the chaos following the intervention they are too few in number to allow for a comfortable existence for our ever-growing settler community. We have to establish new cities, towns, and rural villas, perhaps even a brand new capital that this fair colony could call its own."
GER_Invest_In_Colonialism: "Invest in German-Owned Industries"
GER_Invest_In_Colonialism_desc: "To ensure that the German settlers will never be threatend by a labour strike or a merchant boycott by the locals it is more than wise to promote and sponsor the creation of new German businesses and factories all around the peninsula."
GER_Request_Kaiserliche_Marine: "Request Support of the Kaiserliche Marine"
GER_Request_Kaiserliche_Marine_desc: "While the land garrison we have established is important in ensuring that the colony won't fall into utter chaos, Crimea was never a land won or lost by the 'sabre'. Nay, our existence hinges on the 'sail' instead, that's why it is vital to send an immediate request to the Kaiserliche Marine for technical and unit support."
GER_Modernize_Ukrainian_Fleet: "Modernize the Former Ukrainian Fleet"
GER_Modernize_Ukrainian_Fleet_desc: "Despite what our role as a paramount Eastern European naval base for Germany might suggest, we do not have enough resources or vessels to make that claim a reality. The journey from North Sea ports to the peninsula is simply too costly for the Imperial staff to sign off on a mass transfer, and thus we are forced to rely on remaining Ukrainian ships left over in their chaotic evacuation. Thankfully, the fatherland sent us many naval experts that will ensure this obsolete fleet can be brought up to a modern standard."

GER_Schwarzmeerdeutsche: "Question of the Schwarzmeerdeutsche"
GER_Schwarzmeerdeutsche_desc: "The \"Schwarzmeerdeutsche\", or the Black Sea Germans are the communities that descend from the German settlers that came to Ukraine and Russia in the 18th and 19th century. With our permanent occupation of the peninsula and ultimate stabilization of the region, many in this culturally close to the Kaiserreich community have started to cry out for a revival of an old state-building concept. The Crown Colony of Crimea-Taurida would serve as both the guarantee of the Empire's continued dominance in the Black Sea region but also as a true homeland for all of our Schwarzmeerdeutsche kinsmen."

CRM_Appeal_To_German_Mediation: "Appeal for German Mediation"
CRM_Appeal_To_German_Mediation_desc: "It seems that the crisis with Ukraine has dragged on into a stalemate. Our surge for independence or autonomy has now become mired in a swamp of our own making, and we must look for a way out. We should appeal to the Kaiser and achieve recognition from the Empire to secure our sovereignty."
CRM_Independence: "Crimean Directory Takes Power"
CRM_Independence_desc: "The prolific Crimean Tatar activist Jafer Seidamet has risen to guide the Crimean natives, and has once again reclaimed all of Taurida, declaring an independent Crimean-Tatar state after centuries of struggle. We managed to secure our sovereignty over the Crimea, freeing our peninsula from foreign rule. The Crimean Republic is now to be declared, and agreements have already been made stating that our sovereignty has been officially recognized by some of the countries. Our Crimea is finally free; let us march now for prosperity supported by our new union!"

No longer shall the masses be oporessed by their landlords or the workers have zero rights. All of this shall be shielded by proper legislation, called for in the new party programme adopted by Ozenbashly's National Party."
CRM_Socialization_Of_Factories: "Socialization of Factories"
CRM_Socialization_Of_Factories_desc: "Anywhere in the world where the labour does not control the means of production, an injustice is perpetuated.

The workers need to have their voice heard and we shall make that no longer an impossibility, but a factual reality."
CRM_Soviet_Power: "Power of Councils"
CRM_Soviet_Power_desc: "An unnecessarily centralized state not only leads to the rise of dictators, but also flies in the face of what true socialism stands for. Thanks to the recent reforms performed by our government we can observe a rise of local people's councils, introducing self-management, democracy and also popular representation. The only thing remaining in achieving true workers' democracy is the outdated structure of the Qurultai."
CRM_Delegation_To_Internationale: "Delegation to the Internationale"
CRM_Delegation_To_Internationale_desc: "The Third Internationale has proven to be the only organization in the world that truly cares about the workers and people of all continents and countries.

CRM_Assist_Shirket_desc: "\"Shirket\" is the agricultural society founded by Amet Ozenbashly as a means of unifying the various regions of Crimea and also ensuring stability within the National Party. With our new powers and resources it would not only be possible, but also beneficial to incorporate Shirket structures directly into the new collective lands and increase their budget. Some may argue that this is nothing more but a corrupt bargain meant to take away support from the traditionally agrarian Narodnik faction but our peasants know better, and deeply appreciate our efforts."

CRM_Kemalist_Vision_desc: "The Ottomans were blessed with an eminent reformer and visionary in the form of Mustafa Kemal. Those who take inspiration from Kemal’s intuition have now risen to dominate our own Milliy Fırqa under the leadership of Jafer Seidamet.  Owing to his stay in the Ottoman Empire during the rule of the wise Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha, Seidamet has a concrete plan of how to heal the broken nation of Crimeans, centralizing and modernizing it but also preserving culturally important traditions."
CRM_Modernization_Of_Crimea: "Modernisation of Crimea"
CRM_Modernization_Of_Crimea_desc: "Like the great Mustafa Kemal, we shall break the shackles of our past, modernizing our laws and institutions to fit the mold of the modern day still remaining true to our traditions. Seeing as our population is deeply religious, we shall allow the Mosques to continue their operations unhindered by governmental overreach."

Our financial system and future industrial pursuits shall be organized around large interest groups of like minded and aptly-skilled workers, managers, and other cogs within the corporate hierarchies sorted out by field or area of expertise, for this is the most sound and secure way to rapidly expand our meager economic might."
CRM_Panturkic_Ideals: "Panturkic Ideals"
CRM_Panturkic_Ideals_desc: "Influenced by ideas of Pan-Ottomanism and Pan-Turkism picked up from his contacts across the Near East and Central Asia, Jafer Seidamet has come to the conclusion that because Crimean Tatars are Turkic peoples as well then our state must pursue closer ties with our Turkic brothers all across the old Turanic lands of Eurasia. Hand in hand, the Pan-Turkic dream shall be realized, or at least taught to the masses to inspire future generations to pick up the torch instead."

CRM_Narodnik_Influence_desc: "With the Milliy Fırqa being dominated by the Narodnik faction, under the leadership of Asan Sabri Ayvazov, Crimea shall carefully navigate the current situation and, in the end, achieve rural prosperity. As an educator and former member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the new Prime Minister knows the situation inside Crimea, and understands that reforms must be focused on uplifting our major peasant population and fostering the growth of the labour class."
CRM_Council_Of_Peoples_Deputies: "Councils of People's Deputies"
CRM_Council_Of_Peoples_Deputies_desc: "Local Councils shall be created to ensure truly representative Democracy takes hold in Crimea.

CRM_Avenge_For_Slavic_Humiliation_desc: "April 19, 1783 - a day that will forever live in infamy within our Crimean society, for this was the day everything was taken from us. The Russia Tsardom had marched into our peninsula just a few years before, and after centuries of Turkic supremacy aided by our allies the old Ottomans, our independent khanate was consumed by the vile Northern Bear. With Russia now wounded and predisposed with internal matters, not even lording over our peninsula anymore - leaving it to the hands of these swine of the Hetmanate - the Tatars of Crimea may finally reach for independence once again. We will undo the humiliations of 1783 and take back our Crimea for ourselves!"

The Crimean Tatars of our peninsula shall be given preferential treatment, better incentives and protections, and be cared for more carefully by the state, for this new nation we are building is for them and them alone. With ample protections and with the state by their side, they shall come to form the backbone of our free Crimea."
CRM_The_Only_Official_Language: "The Only Official Language for Crimea"
CRM_The_Only_Official_Language_desc: "Our Crimean language has a proud history, being linked to the Kipchak and Cuman tongues of our ancestors that once rode across Crimea and the wider Steppe. It has come to be eroded away by Russian, Ukrainian, and other lesser languages. We must work to undo the damages of our old Slavic conquerors and revitalize the Crimean Tatar language. Our language shall rise to become the only one accepted by the state, and schools across the nation will begin teaching our tongue to every child of Crimea. We will take our culture back, one word at a time."
CRM_Small_Slavic_Autonomy: "Miniscule Slavic Autonomy"
CRM_Small_Slavic_Autonomy_desc: "In order to keep the large Slavic minority within our nation from getting rowdy or ambitious, we have moved to grant these Russians, Ukranians, Kubans and others small amounts of autonomy. Hopefully, this will be enough to placate their masses and prevent an uprising as we strive to restore our former glories and build up our newly independent Crimea."
CRM_Preserve_Our_Culture: "Crimean-Tatar Cultural Renaissance"
CRM_Preserve_Our_Culture_desc: "The Russian Empire and the Ukranians after them have tried their hardest for centuries to eradicate our unique culture as they sought to ‘Slavify’ our peninsula. With our sovereignty secured, this degradation must stop! We must revitalize our unique Turkic culture and throw off the shackles of lesser Slavic traditions at once. We are a Turkic people - the proud and noble Crimean Tatars of the old Great Horde and Desht-i Kipchak; not some other rowdy group of savage Slavs!"
CRM_Construction_Of_Mosques: "New Mosques for a New State"
CRM_Construction_Of_Mosques_desc: "Our peninsula has come to be dotted with false houses of worship; Orthodox Churches and monasteries stand where the once-great mosques of our Sunni faith used to rise into the heavens. In order to revitalize the Muslim faith here in Crimea, a new series of mosques shall be raised - both built from scratch and with many taking over existing heretical houses of worship."
CRM_Renovate_Bakhisaray: "Renovate Bağçasaray and the Hansaray"
CRM_Renovate_Bakhisaray_desc: "The old capital of the Crimean Khanate - Bağçasaray - stands within the heart of our peninsula, just North of the Slavic capital of Sevastopol. At the center of this old and noble capital lies the Hansaray, the last surviving palace from our old realm. With our independence secured and with Crimean Tatar supremacy established, we should move to renovate and repair these enduring symbols of the former Khanate. Once renovated, we will begin moving our administrative center and core of our regime’s operations to our new and restored capital, for Bağçasaray shall once again become the seat of our power, state, and culture."
CRM_Sharia_Law: "Institute Sharia Law"
CRM_Sharia_Law_desc: "In order to tame this peninsula of Slavic sin and debauchery, we shall create a new, formalized legal code for our new state. Islamic Sharia Law will be the foundation of this new legal code, with the tenets of Sunni Islam becoming the foundation of our entire justice system. By following the Quran, the Hadith, and Allah, we will bring lawfulness and piety to this savage, Slav-infected Crimea."
CRM_Push_Towards_Federation: "Push Towards a Crimean Federation"
CRM_Push_Towards_Federation_desc: "Crimea is a diverse and varied land, and to prioritize or to favor only one group would surely bring ruin to our peninsula and compromise our newly-won sovereignty.

CRM_Representative_Qurultai: "A Representative Qurultai"
CRM_Representative_Qurultai_desc: "A Qurultai - called Qurultai in other Mongol and Turkic languages - are political and military councils, traditionally made up of khans and chiefs, used to serve as assemblies and governing bodies for the old Turkic states. We shall revive this idea, building a new Qurultai assembly to become the modern representative body of our federation. Functioning as a house of representatives and a legislature, our new Qurultai shall become the foundation of our new federalized democracy."
CRM_Question_Of_Karaite_Minority: "The Question of the Karaite Autonomy"
CRM_Question_Of_Karaite_Minority_desc: "The Karaites - also called the Krymkaraylar, the Qarays, and the Karaims - are a ethnically distinct Turkic subgroup that follow Karaite Judaism - a unique form of Judaism that does not adhere to written collections of oral traditions and is itself derived but greatly differentiated from old Rabbinic Judaism. These Turkic Jews are small in number but loud in their demands for special protections and autonomy. We must decide what to do with this rowdy minority before they become a real issue."
CRM_Draft_Constitution: "Draft a Crimean Constitution"
CRM_Draft_Constitution_desc: "In order to define our new independent Crimean state and what it stands for, a new Constitution must be drafted.

CRM_Jadidist_Reforms: "Jadidist Reforms"
CRM_Jadidist_Reforms_desc: "Jadidism is a form of modernist reformationist movement started by Muslim Turkics from within the old Russian Empire. Seeking to stem the tide of cultural and spiritual degradation that has plagued our vastly-spread and often-conquered peoples, the Jadids called for a modernist, European-modeled but wholly Muslim Turkic rebirth supported by educational reform and the pursuit of social justice, civil liberties, and religious freedoms while ushering in a new cultural renaissance. We shall carry on the torch of this noble movement, bringing the ideals and goals of the Jadids to our varied people.

CRM_Labor_Protection: "Liberal Labor Protections"
CRM_Labor_Protection_desc: "The varied workers of our Crimea are the backbone of our industry, our economy, and our very society. We must protect these pillars of the state with ample protections both on the job and off it so that they can breathe easily knowing our administration has their back. With a swathe of liberal legislation, we shall ensure the prosperity and safety of our working class without resorting to dangerous Socialism."
CRM_Land_Reform: "Exhaustive Land Reforms"
CRM_Land_Reform_desc: "The system of land and estate allotment and organization in Crimea is woefully outdated and exploitative. In order to build our modern and free federation, we must reform this system to be more fair and open to new faces becoming small landowners. This will open up the economy, allow larger, more unprofitable estates to be broken up into smaller privately-owned parcels in order to reinvigorate the land, bringing us more profit and destagnating our archaic land-use system."
CRM_Promote_Secularism: "Promote State Secularism"
CRM_Promote_Secularism_desc: "Our federation must be a wholly Secular state, allowing religious freedoms but not letting any single faith come to influence the government or become more favored by our regime.

CRM_Revive_Sevastopol_Shipyards_desc: "Aqyar - or as the Slavs call it ‘Sevastopol’ - is the largest city in Crimea and is possibly the most important port on the Black Sea aside from the famed docks of Istanbul. A major hub of trade and commerce as well as the homeport of the Black Sea Fleet, the mighty dockyards of this peninsular metropolis once were the pride of the Russian Empire and the Khazarian Khaganate. We must repair, refit, and reforge these massive and storied dockyards so that they once again can become the pride of our Crimea, as well as the modern and pristine centerpiece of our economy and navy."
CRM_The_Crimean_Black_Fleet: "The Crimean Black Sea Fleet"
CRM_The_Crimean_Black_Fleet_desc: "With the Ukranians having seized much of the Black Sea Fleet for themselves, we are left with just a fraction of the noble fleet. However, we shall use this proud foundation as the starting point for a new navy - our navy. The Crimean Black Sea Fleet shall be forged in the heart of the Aqyar docks and set sail into our sea, the Black Sea, with our flag atop their masts held high. These unsullied warships shall become the sword and shield of our state, and we will give everything we need to and more to make our new fleet a reality."
CRM_Establish_National_Guard: "Establish the Peninsular Guard"
CRM_Establish_National_Guard_desc: "In order to defend the state, a new national guard has been commissioned by our administration. Drafted from veterans of our struggle for independence or of fighting in the foreign wars of our former masters, or picked from volunteers who pass our rigorous training regime, these new guardians of Crimea - informally the Peninsular Guard - shall be the first and last line of defence between our people and their land, and the vile wolves that circle us even now."
CRM_Crimean_Tatar_Officer_Academy: "A Crimean Tatar Officer Academy"
CRM_Crimean_Tatar_Officer_Academy_desc: "Though we have many able officers under our command, that is only temporary, for war, disease, or old age could claim their lives at any moment, leaving us without the necessary military staff to effectively and efficiently wage war or to defend the nation. To rectify this, we must build an officer academy in Aqyar to train the next generation of officers, admirals, and generals for our armed forces. The academy shall also rise to become our primary center of military research and development, doctrinal design, and strategy and war plan planning, becoming an all-in-one headquarters for Crimea’s varied military forces."
CRM_New_Educational_Standards: "New Educational Standards"
CRM_New_Educational_Standards_desc: "In order to free Crimea from illiteracy and lack of education, a new initiative shall be put in place to educate the masses of our peninsula.

With new factories, new conscripts, and new weapons of war, we shall seize our destiny by force."
CRM_Make_An_Example_Of_Solomon_Krym: "Honor the ‘Real’ Solomon Krym"
CRM_Make_An_Example_Of_Solomon_Krym_desc: "The national father of our independent Crimea and a fellow Karaite as well, Solomon Krym is perhaps Crimea’s greatest contemporary figure. He is also sadly deceased, but that does not mean his legacy must end there. Though he was not fond of our nationalist movement, the public does not need to know that. We shall raise Krym as the first Karaite hero of the modern age and the martyred herald of our new destiny. He will become Crimea’s own national hero and his image and legacy will be perfect tools to utilize by the state to win over the masses, for he was the man who united our people against foreign foes and grave threats like none other."
CRM_Reject_Semitic_Origins: "Reject Semitic Origins"
CRM_Reject_Semitic_Origins_desc: "We are no sons of David or Abarham, for we are the sons of the Turkic Khans! Though we are devout in our Jewish faith, we have no links of blood or culture to the Semite and their widespread diaspora. Unlike these failed children of God, we shall reclaim our homeland and march to our destiny free of their disgraces as the true heirs to the Turkic Khazars."

CRM_Treaty_With_Egypt: "A Treaty with Egypt"
CRM_Treaty_With_Egypt_desc: "With our preparations for war slowly crescendoing to a showdown with the old Sublime Porte, it would be wise to establish diplomatic ties with Egypt. Through a new secret treaty, we shall affirm the cooperation between our two nations as we both prepare to bring down the hedonistic land of the Ottomans."
CRM_Organize_Weapons_Shipments: "Organize Weapons Shipments"
CRM_Organize_Weapons_Shipments_desc: "To fight the coming war, we will need every firearm and weapon of war we can muster. We must reach out to the international market, whether it be the White market or the Black, in order to requisition the gun shipments we will need to arm our military in full."
CRM_Denounce_Rabbinists: "Denounce Rabbinic Judaism"
CRM_Denounce_Rabbinists_desc: "Though the Karaites are technically derived from the Rabbinic sect, we are in no way linked to their heretical ideas despite our close proximity to the Krymchak Jews of Crimea. Though we would never bring harm to our fellow Jewish brethren, we hereby formally denounce Rabbinic Judaism and renounce any and all Rabbinic ties, for our refined, purified, and uniquely Turkic Karaite Judaism is the one, true Jewish faith."
CRM_Establish_Ties_With_Lithuanian_Karaites: "Establish Ties with Lithuanian Karaites"
CRM_Establish_Ties_With_Lithuanian_Karaites_desc: "Lithuania holds a small but vibrant population of fellow Karaites who emigrated there decades ago after a series of repressions done by the old Russian Empire. We should reach out to these distant kin and establish close ties with their community and businesses, fostering unity between all Karaites. Though they may be far from Crimea, they can still help our rising state prosper."
CRM_Spread_The_Khazar_Myth: "Spread the Truth of the Khazar Myth"
CRM_Spread_The_Khazar_Myth_desc: "The Khazar hypotheses for Ashkenazi and Cossack ancestry, called the Khazar Myth by its foolish detractors, states that both the Cossacks and the Askenazi Jews are descended from the Khazars, and as such, most European Jews and Cossacks are of our blood. Seraya Shapshal is a close adherent to this theory, and one of its loudest proponents. By his word, the so-called ‘Khazar Myth’ shall be revealed to be what it truly always has been - nothing but the truth!"
CRM_Revive_Khazar_Traditions: "Revive the Culture and Traditions of Khazaria"
CRM_Revive_Khazar_Traditions_desc: "The traditions and culture of Khazari must be revitalized to become the bedrock of our new khaganate. Though they have faded into the pages of history, we shall not let the noble great horde be forgotten, for it is our duty as their heirs to ensure that their memory and customs live on in perpetuity. Their culture shall become our culture, modified and modernized to fit the needs of our state."
CRM_Restoring_Our_Legacy: "Restoring Our Legacy"
CRM_Restoring_Our_Legacy_desc: "The time to cast off our shackles shall soon be upon us, for the time to restore the legacy of the Khazar Khanate is near. We will soon march into our bright new future under Gakhan Shapshal and bring honor and prosperity to the Karaites like never before. Let us charge into our destiny and restore our khaganate from the sands of time!"
CRM_Preemptive_Srike_On_Ukrainians: "Preemptive Strike on the Ukrainians"
CRM_Preemptive_Srike_On_Ukrainians_desc: "The Ukranians have been plotting their revenge since the moment we declared an independent Crimea. We must strike them before they strike us, for only through the element of surprise will we succeed. To war, and to Kyiv!"
CRM_Bring_Cossacks_Into_The_Fold: "Bring Cossacks Into the Fold"
CRM_Bring_Cossacks_Into_The_Fold_desc: "The Don and Kuban Cossacks lie open and unsuspecting to our greater ambitions. There they sit, across the thinnest point of the Black Sea just East of the Kerch Strait, just ready for the taking. We shall march to Yekaterinodar and beyond, seizing the lands of the Northern Caucasus and beyond before we strike Russia."
CRM_Restore_Volga_Bulgaria: "Restore Volga Bulgaria"
CRM_Restore_Volga_Bulgaria_desc: "To the North, Russia lords over the Volga Bulgars - our linguistic and ethnic brethren. We will march into the icy lands of the Northern Bear and liberate these fellow Turkics, recreating the once-noble Volga Bulgaria as a buffer state between our borders and the wilds of Russian Asia and wider Europe."
CRM_Third_Arab_Khazar_War: "Third Arab-Khazar War"
CRM_Third_Arab_Khazar_War_desc: "Despite its confusing name, the third Arab-Khazar war is firstly named as such because of the previous two wars, fought more than a thousand years ago between Khazars and Khalifates of the Middle East, that precede it and secondly in order to stoke up more patriotic fervor with the masses by pulling on age-old grudges. Though it is not exactly the same foe, we are once again fighting against another powerful Muslim country - the Ottoman Empire! Now let us march to Istanbul and burn it to the ground!"
CRM_Pax_Khazarica: "PAX CHAZARICA"
CRM_Pax_Khazarica_desc: "Under our noble and pious hand, the lands of the Khazar Khaganate have been united under our regime. We are the heirs of Khazaria and the greatest, most noble practitioners of the Jewish faith on Earth. By casting off the last shreds of Rabbinic influence and uplifting our Turkic legacy, we have brought honor and prosperity to the Karaite people at last. An unprecedented era of peace has begun under the rule of Gakhan Shapshal, and now under his guidance we shall march proudly into our new golden age."


### Ideas ###
CRM_water_shortage: "Water Shortage"
CRM_water_shortage_desc: "The shortage of fresh water has existed on the peninsula at all times. The main reasons are considered to be arid climate and karst rocks. The problem was partially solved when, in 1931, the Bakhchisarai reservoir was built on the Egiz-Oba beam, filled with Kacha waters. However, the growth of the urban population complicates this problem. If we fail to solve it as the peninsula industrializes, we may face serious consequences."
CRM_water_shortage_tt: "§RWe will face a serious humanitarian and environmental disaster if we don't deal with water shortage timely§!"
CRM_severe_water_shortage: "Severe Water Shortage"
CRM_severe_water_shortage_desc: "We have exceeded the reserves of fresh water sufficient for the viability of the peninsula, and now we are facing serious problems with water scarcity.

CRM_ukrainian_federation_UKR: "Federation With Crimea"
CRM_ever_present_russians: "Ever-present Russians"
CRM_ever_present_russians_desc: "Almost 40% of the peninsula's population consider themselves Russians. Unlike the rest of Ukraine, the situation here is particularly acute, since the Russian population here is an absolute majority, both in comparison with Ukrainians and in comparison with Tatars. The policy of Ukrainization carried out over the past 15 years has only worsened the situation, and we have to constantly make concessions to the Russians."
CRM_khazar_revival_society: "Krymkaraylar Influence"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_desc: "Seraya Shapshal, or, as he is called, His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal, is a spiritual leader of the Tatar Karaims, a Jewish religious movement. Since 1915 he has been the hakham of the Tauride and Odessa Karaite spiritual board and under his patronage the Jewish rights of Crimeans were respected. The Hetman's rule changed everything, when the policy of Ukrainisation, even if it was not as harsh as Shapshal imagined, made him openly speak against King, criticize Hetman and start public discussion about Jewish autonomy in the Crimea. He is not as simple as he seems, and in the future he can become a serious problem."
CRM_khazar_revival_society_1: "Khazar Revival Society"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_1_desc: "With our republic finally becoming independent from the Ukraine, the Karaite influence and Shapshal's authority has grown a lot. In fact, to the extent where he proclaimed the restoration of Khazar Khaganate under his rule. This is a pure nonsense, but such influential person as Shapshal can turn the Jewish population against us."
CRM_khazar_revival_society_2: "Dreams of Khazar Khaganate"
CRM_khazar_revival_society_2_desc: "The Khazar Revival Society under His Excellency Hajji Seraya Khan Shapshal have seized power in Crimea, efficiently removing all non-Jewish from official positions. The dream of restoring the Khazar Khaganate is still in the air, and the desire of our nation to fight for it has grown as well."

CRM_multinational_federation_desc: "The Government of the Crimean People's Republic has set a course to create comfortable conditions on the peninsula for all its inhabitants, guaranteeing equal rights to all nations inhabiting Crimea. On the way to a multinational federation, we have to make concessions, but this definitely guarantees peace and prosperity for our region."
CRM_crimea_for_crimeans: "Crimea For The Crimeans!"
CRM_crimea_for_crimeans_desc: "The Government of the Crimean People's Republic has embarked on the Ukrainization and de-Russification of the peninsula. For many years, the Crimean Tatars were humiliated and practically destroyed by a foreign culture planted from the outside. It is time to regain the right to vote, the right of self-determination and the right to speak Crimean Tatar."
CRM_german_treaty: "German Occupation"
CRM_yalta_agreements: "Yalta Agreements"
CRM_yalta_agreements_desc: "The treaty signed in Yalta between German and Russian representatives, as well as Jafer Seidamet from the Crimean Tatar side, though deepened our dependence on Germany, has also given us an opportunity to rely on Russian protection, that might be worth something someday."

CRM_water_resources: "The Problem of Water Supply in Crimea"
CRM_water_resources_desc: "The shortage of fresh water has existed on the peninsula at all times. The main reasons are considered to be arid climate and karst rocks. The problem was partially solved when, in 1931, the Bakhchisarai reservoir was built on the Egiz-Oba beam, filled with Kacha waters. However, the growth of the urban population and industrialization complicates this problem.\n\nThe current government plan is to expand the existing system of reservoirs and build at least two new ones, as well as to create a North Crimean Canal for pumping water from the Dnieper River, as well as water supplies from other countries.\n\nStatus of the £water Water Supplies: [CRM_GetWaterStatus]"

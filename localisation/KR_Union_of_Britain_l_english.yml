ENG_class_war_idea:0 "Class War"
ENG_militia_idea:0 "Militias"
ENG_militia_idea_desc:0 "The British military is still largely organised in the impromptu worker's militias of 1925. While these local militias have a high morale, they seem disregardful for some of the finer concepts for warfare, such as the need for working logistics. Due to their deafening cries of 'Break the chains! Break the chains!', our officers routinely suffer from psychological breakdowns."
ENG_isolation_idea:0 "Splendid Isolation"
ENG_isolation_idea_desc:0 "While the Congregationists are the most vocal about it, all factions of British politics advocate at least some form of British isolationism. This may change over time, but for now it will make foreign involvement very hard."

ENG_synthetic_oil_lover:0 "Revolutionary Synthetic Oil"
ENG_synthetic_oil_lover_desc:0 "Domestic oil supplies won't be enough to sustain our military. Fortunately, our synthetic oil tech is nothing short of the best in the world. With the right investment, this may be enough to keep our planes flying, our tanks driving and our ships moving."

ENG_england_army_mutiny:0 "Internal Collapse"
ENG_england_army_mutiny_desc:0 "Much of the Union is racked by internal strife as the people oppose Moseley's reforms. Much of the army has gone into revolt while France and Italy avert their gaze proclaiming they must not be shackled to English troubles."
ENG_refugee_crisis:0 "Refugee Crisis"
ENG_refugee_crisis:0 "With Mosely's radical reforms leading to the breakup of the union, many more moderate syndicalists, liberals and poliical dissidents are fleeing the nation to hopefully find safe refugee in Scotland and Wales."

ENG_ministry_truth_idea:0 "Ministry of Truth"
ENG_ministry_truth_idea_desc:0 "The Ministry of Truth is a government ministry in charge of enforcing loyalty to the Chairman. The mass destruction of reactionary literature, necessary falsicfication of historical events that tarnish the reputation of the revolution and production of news media, education and entertainment for the populace of Britain are all used to disuade reactionary thought and maintain devotion to the revolution."
ENG_cable_street_idea:0 "Memories of Cable Street"
ENG_cable_street_idea_desc:0 "The riots that took place on Cable Street showed the entire nation that not all are loyal to the Chairman, foolish defiance has led more to take up arms against Mosley. These pathetic attempts at rebelling will be crushed however the simple existance of struggle shows weakness in the Union. The memories of what took place at Cable Street now serve as a battle cry for those opposed to Maximism."
ENG_maximist_idea:0 "Maximist Fanaticism"
ENG_maximist_idea_desc:0 "The success of the revolution has forged an unbreakable nationwide devotion to the Chairman, all workers from every corner of Britain must do their duty to provide for the nation.

Only Mosley can create the utopia so deserved by the working people! Hail the Revolution! Hail the Chairman!"

ENG_totalist_party_long:0 "Maximist wing of the TUC                                        §gIn the aftermath of the revolution Oswald Mosely was able to cultivate a unique form of syndicalism he has dubbed 'Maximism' in which the syndicalist society must be radically transformed and centralized. While to many this comes across as tyrannical, Mosely has been able to attract likeminded individuals to his cause and it seems to grow by the day, regardless a victory for Mosely and his Maximists would be a suprising and disturbing result.§!"
ENG_syndicalist_party:0 "Feds/Cons"
ENG_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Federationist/Congregationist wing of the TUC        §gWith the vote likely to be split between the various groups at the upcoming TUC election, the too most likeminded groups of the Federationists and Congregationists have banded together in an electoral pact with Arthur Horner as the main candidate and Annie Kenney as his running mate. The decision of who is to lead will likely be settled after the election.§!"
ENG_CON_syndicalist_party:0 "Congregationists"
ENG_CON_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Congregationist wing of the TUC                           §gThe Congregationalists are unique offshoot from the orthodox syndicalist movement that had arisen in France and Italy, promoting pacifism and pushing feminist causes as well as the general improvement of the status of women. To many working men this seems like an unnecessary goal and a distraction from the revolution but they appeal to women in a large number. It is unlikely the Congregationalists can take power on their own and they are likely to be propelled into a position through dealings with the larger Federationists§!"
ENG_FED_syndicalist_party:0 "Federationists"
ENG_FED_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Federationist wing of the TUC                    §gRepresenting the more standard and orthodox syndicalist views, the Federationists are noted for their support of the status quo with some minor reform. Focusing on an evolution of the system rather than radical upheaval they instead to steer a steady and untempered course through these stormy times. Representing the status quo it'd be suprising for the Federationists not to hold sway in the TUC.§!"
ENG_radical_socialist_party:0 "Autonomists"                               
ENG_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Autonomist wing of the TUC                     §gSyndicalism's focus on decentralisation would inevitablly lead to calls for more power to the Home Nations and with the Federationists only allocating power to local trade unions it was inevitable that special interest groups seeking to advocate for Scotland and Wales would form. Led by the famed Welsh poet and nationlist Niclas Y Glais, the Autonomists represent the most moderate but also more radical leanings within the TUC. Made up primarily of Scottish and Welsh nationalists they gain support elsewhere for their moderate and liberal views attracting those who would otherwise be disenfranchised in the new Syndicalist order.§!"

While noble in its aims, the small party was unable to have much impact in British political scene and saw mass defections both during the initial revolution and especially after with most of its former supporters finding a comfortable home in the Autonomists. While some TUC representatives swear allegiance to the now zombified party it has no central leadership or real clout.§!"
ENG_social_liberal_party:0 "Liberals"

In the aftermath of the revolution, to suit the new realities the Liberals dropped the business friendly approach and fully adopted a progressive world view, gaining it some minor support in the TUC. It continues to be the only legal 'party' in the entire Union though it holds no sway in politics and is considered a non-entity by many. It's old leader David Lloyd George continues as its nominal chairman despite his retirement from politics and in reality he serves as more of a meaningless figurehead and personality rather than actual leader..§!"
ENG_market_liberal_party:0 "National Liberals"
ENG_market_liberal_party_long:0 "National Liberal Party                                            §gThe National Liberals are less of a party and more of a clique of likeminded individuals, mostly comprised of the ex-middle class and Liberal members who followed the Gladstonian tradition, finding no home in the new Liberal party. While the group have no real popular support and are effectively unable to ever take power as well as lacking in central leadership they represent the most cohesive reactionary opposition to the post-revolution Syndicalist order.§!"

ENG_social_conservative_party_long:0 "The Conservative Party                                         §gThe Conservative Party was officially disbanded following the revolution with centuries of support for the old order theoretically vanishing. The reality was much more stark, while much of the party's natural supporters and top officials escaped to Canada, it continues to linger on, mostly among supporters in the rural areas of the Union. While these small and disorganised 'Conservative Fraternities' as they are called are not illegal, syndicalist militas make a habit of harrassing their members and breaking up their meetings.§!"

While their service is desperately needed to makeup for the chronic lack of skilled military leadership among our direct supporters, their loyalty is constantly in question and they have made it implicityly known that they will not tolerate the government to overstep its boundaries, more specifically a Maxmist administration. For now though they continue to serve with a close eye on the government.§!"

ENG_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Royalist Sympathizers                                  §gMonarchism never truly died in Britain and while republicanism has firmly taken root in the minds of many British men and women, many would still accept and some even be glad for a return of the King. Among the most radical of these are groups that advocate for not only a return of the King in Canada but an extension of his powers. While only comprised of fringe groups allocated to the countryside, they continue to serve as an irritating nuisance to the Union.§!"

ENG_national_populist_party_long:0 "Assorted Nationalist Groups                              §gWhile the Autonomists represent the socialist side of nationalism in Scotland and Wales, on the other side of the coin is made up of more radical and openly reactionary groups such as the Homeland Watch and the Welsh Home Rule Army. Openly opposed to our regime, syndicalism and continued rule from London, these groups and other similar ones are not a cohesive body and so serve as little more than a thuggish nuisance. If things were to explode out of control however, they might just seize their chance to break away once and for all.§!"


### Focuses ###
ENG_status_quo:0 "Status Quo"
ENG_status_quo_desc:0 "The syndicalist order has withstood an onslaught of political challenges, but has held firm. Britain shall keep its course, and continue to boldly and unapologetically champion the cause of the worker and the revolution above all else."
ENG_united_britain:0 "United Britain"
ENG_united_britain_desc:0 "Britain faces great adversity both within and without. While conflict with reactionary nations may prove unavoidable, surely our nation and its people should stand united. Enemies of the revolution must be confronted and eliminated by any means necessary."
ENG_decentralized_command:0 "Decentralised Command"
ENG_decentralized_command_desc:0 "While our armies are decentralised, they still rely on inefficient chains of command to make tactical decisions. Non-commissioned officers and even the humblest of militiamen must be instilled with the spirit of leadership and given the agency to direct their units as they see fit. No man should die waiting for an order to be issued."

ENG_the_common_land:0 "The Common Land"
ENG_the_common_land_desc:0 "While Britain was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, much of our nation remains rural and reliant on agriculture. To facilitate increased crop yields, all lands seized from noble estates during the revolution should be parceled to rural syndicates. Britain's land shall now belong to her people alone!"

ENG_cayley_plan:0 "Cayley's Plan"
ENG_cayley_plan_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Admiral Richard Cayley is at the forefront of a highly vocal group of naval officers who wish to see Britain rapidly expand its submarine fleet and restructure its doctrine with Germany as its model."
ENG_anstice_plan:0 "Anstice's Plan"
ENG_anstice_plan_desc:0 "While many scoff at the notion that aircraft could ever serve as the backbone of a navy, Admiral Edmund Anstice asserts the necessity of controlling the skies over the sea. To do so, Anstice proposes that the role and number of aircraft carriers be greatly expanded."
ENG_dickens_plan:0 "Dickens' Plan"
ENG_dickens_plan_desc:0 "The Royal Navy was centred around the battleship and naval firepower. While Britain lost the Weltkrieg, its Navy held strong throughout the conflict. Since the revolution, naval strategy has advanced rapidly, and to many Republican naval officers, the Union of Britain must make a concerted effort to catch up to its rivals, rather than take a radical new approach to naval warfare."
ENG_merchant_marine:0 "Merchant Marine"
ENG_merchant_marine_desc:0 "The British Merchant Service was on the bleeding edge of civilian shipping administration. During the Weltkrieg, tactics developed by the Service to counter U-Boat raids kept Britain from terrible starvation. If our republic is to have any chance of surviving future conflicts, we must develop a robust Merchant Marine to both regulate shipping and conscript civilian ships for military service when needed."
ENG_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand Dockyards"
ENG_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "With a Merchant Marine service established and all union operated ships firmly integrated, our nation's ports are becoming increasingly congested. With the problem projected to only worsen, we must immediately expand the most clogged ports."
ENG_submarines:0 "Submarine Effort"
ENG_submarines_desc:0 "Per Admiral Cayley's direction, our presently quite small submarine fleet is due for expansion. Our current submarine designs, however, are inadequate. We must develop and deploy more advanced models."
ENG_destroyers:0 "Destroyer Effort"
ENG_destroyers_desc:0 "Our new fleet cannot operate entirely below the waves. To support out U-Boats, we need ships that are both versatile and agile, capable of dealing with those threats are U-Boats are unable to."
ENG_carrier_efforts:0 "Carrier Effort"
ENG_carrier_efforts_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers have taken on a much greater role in naval combat, and Britain must change with the times. Our carrier fleet will be the centrepiece of the renewed British Navy."
ENG_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
ENG_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Traditional aircraft designs are unable to fulfil the unique requirements of naval aviation. We must develop new aircraft designed be operated from carriers and other situations where runway space is at a premium."
ENG_battlecruisers:0 "Fast Battleship Effort"
ENG_battlecruisers_desc:0 "While lacking the armour of a Dreadnought, Fast Battleships are agile and pack a versatile suite of heavy guns. An evolution of the Battlecruisers of WW1 who served effectively during the Weltkrieg, an expansion of our Fast Battleship fleets is essential to the reconstruction of the British Navy."
ENG_battleships:0 "Dreadnought Effort"
ENG_battleships_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts are the kings of the sea, and were key to the global dominance of the British Royal Navy at the prior to the Weltkrieg. If we are to ever regain our naval strength, we must have new battleships."
ENG_republican_marines:0 "Republican Marines"
ENG_republican_marines_desc:0 "While naval power and the projection thereof are critical to military success, ships alone are unable to invade islands or assault coasts. Few Marine officers sided with the revolution in 1925, and as a result, the Republic's ability to conduct amphibious operations was stunted. If we are to having any hope of confronting our enemies across the seas, we must have a Marine department."
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty:0 "Revolutionary Admiralty"
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty_desc:0 "The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs was the body responsible for the administration of the Royal Navy and served as a forum for communication between officers. The Republican Navy currently lacks any comparable office, with Naval affairs often tied-up in politics. Thus, we must establish an independent and thoroughly socialist Admiralty."
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves:0 "Britannia Rules the Waves"
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves_desc:0 "At last, the British Navy is beginning to look like its former self. If not already, soon enough, Britain will again rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!"

ENG_republican_air_force:0 "Republican Air Force"
ENG_republican_air_force_desc:0 "Air power is critical for success on the modern battlefield. Currently, our air service is subordinate to our army, and while that assures democratisation, an independent Air Force would certainly be more effective. Thus, we must establish an Air Force both independent and socialist in character."
ENG_new_pilot_training:0 "New Pilot Training"
ENG_new_pilot_training_desc:0 "Pilot training in many nations, including our own, has been largely non-standard, and reliant on enthusiasts turned instructors. By consulting with prominent pilots, we can develop an effective training regimen."
ENG_flying_women:0 "Women's Flying Corps"
ENG_flying_women_desc:0 "Capable pilots are always in short supply, and the women of our nation, whose support was so crucial to the success of the revolution, yearn for the freedom of the skies. While it will certainly prove controversial, we have drafted a plan to create allow women to serve in the RAF in support roles to free up more men for combat."
ENG_aviation_unions:0 "Aviation Unions"
ENG_aviation_unions_desc:0 "Many syndicates around Britain operate small aerodromes for a variety of purposes. The larger of these facilities should be given state funding for expansion."
ENG_aviation_fuel_administration:0 "Aviation Fuel Administration"
ENG_aviation_fuel_administration_desc:0 "Without fuel, it does not matter how skilled our pilots are. It is likely that when war comes our fuel imports will be cut-off so we must work towards domestics sources of fuel; for the safety of the revolution we mustn't be depended on capitalist suppliers of oil. They can't be trusted."
ENG_air_observer_corps:0 "Air Observer Corps"
ENG_air_observer_corps_desc:0 "While London was terrorised throughout the Weltkrieg by German airships, relatively little damage was done by these raids. Since then however, the range and payload of aircraft has increased greatly. To counter the threat, we should create a volunteer organisation which looks vigilantly for enemy planes to forewarn our interceptor and anti-aircraft teams."
ENG_expand_air_unions:0 "Expand Air Unions"
ENG_expand_air_unions_desc:0 "Our programme of aerodrome enlargement was of great benefit to the expansion of the Republican Air Force, but proved to be a substantial administrative burden. With the air force now well-established, the Air Union programme can be expanded."

ENG_international:0 "Britain Within the International"
ENG_international_desc:0 "Britain's political factions advocate quite different foreign policy approaches.

These will be nights to remember..."

ENG_expand_industry_1_desc:0 "The capitalist regime of old neglected Wales and the Midlands for centuries, and allowed, if not outright encouraged, the gradual depopulation of the region as its labourers migrated to England's southern cities for menial jobs.

ENG_local_initiative:0 "Expand Local Initiative"
ENG_local_initiative_desc:0 "While we have granted much power to the local communes, they continue to deal primarily with the central government. We should make reaching the central government harder so that our workers will work with each other for true socialist progress."

ENG_home_rule:0 "Home Rule"
ENG_home_rule_desc:0 "Syndicalism has to be achieved locally. Some offices, like tax enforcers - nobody likes those people anyway - can be moved to the home nation capitals of Cardiff and Edinburgh. They can prepare the establishment of local TUCs."
ENG_dissolve_tuc:0 "Dissolve the TUC"
ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union Congress has served its purpose. While it once represented the Syndicalist dream of true proletarian government, it now symbolises Centralist repression to many.

ENG_big_boat_research_desc:0 "The Republican Navy has put a lot of effort and resources into the RNS Rebecca - but it's really not the right path.

uob.0.t:0 "The New Britain"
uob.0.d:0 "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany dragged on inconclusively for two years. In 1921, the stalemate was finally broken when Lloyd-George agreed to the German proposal of a "Peace with Honour". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, content to build socialism in isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
uob.0.a:0 "Fascinating."

uob.1.t:0 "The 1936 Trade Union Council Begins"
uob.1.d:0 "After weeks of preliminary meetings and preparation, today the main part of the Trade Union Congress of 1936 has begun. The various factions of the congress have sent their delegates and their leaders to London to argue for their position. We shall see what shall happen."
uob.1.a:0 "Let the Congress Begin!"

uob.2.t:0 "Economic Policy Vote"
uob.2.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
uob.2.a:0 "Max.: The economy must be expanded, centralised and streamlined."
uob.2.b:0 "Fed.: The economy must be expanded and centralised."
uob.2.c:0 "Aut.: Greater economic autonomy must be given to the Home Nations."

uob.3.t:0 "Internal Policy Vote"
uob.3.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
uob.3.a:0 "Max.: The local governments must be brought in line with the TUC."
uob.3.b:0 "Fed.: The current system is satisfactory."
uob.3.c:0 "Aut.: Decentralisation - perhaps even local TUC's for the Home Nations."

uob.4.t:0 "Foreign Policy Vote"
uob.4.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of foreign policy specifically what should the Union of Britain's role within the International be. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions."

uob.5.a:0 "Max.: The military must be expanded and the local militias placed under TUC control."
uob.5.b:0 "Fed.: The army must be expanded but only in self-defence."
uob.5.c:0 "Aut.: A Scottish, English, and Welsh national army."

uob.6.t:0 "The Resignation of Philip Snowden"
uob.6.d:0 "On the last day of the TUC congress Chairman Philip Snowden climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicians do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall. The country is shocked and in a few days' time the TUC will have to vote on a new chairman."
uob.6.a:0 "Shocking, to say the least."

uob.14.ad:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Horner."

uob.15.t:0 "Show of Force"
uob.15.d:0 "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
uob.15.a:0 "Keep the fleet in our territorial waters."
uob.15.b:0 "Send the Grand Fleet towards Ireland."
uob.15.c:0 "Divide the fleet and perform manoeuvres near the Azores and Iceland."

uob.16.t:0 "British Fleet Manoeuvres"
uob.16.d:0 "The British navy has steamed out of its ports and has assembled to demonstrate its power against our neutral island. In face of this grave situation many politicians suggest that Ireland should find someone to guarantee its independence. The most reasonable option would be Germany - but there are even some advocating a return to Windsor protection."

uob.17.t:0 "Ireland Requests Canadian Support"
uob.17.d:0 "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violations of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
uob.17.a:0 "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Entente."
uob.17.b:0 "Announce our support for Ireland."
uob.17.c:0 "We are not ready for such involvement in the Old World."

uob.18.t:0 "Canada Protects Ireland"
uob.18.d:0 "The Canadian government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Windsor influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
uob.18.a:0 "Most splendid!"
uob.18.b:0 "Bloody hell!"

uob.19.t:0 "Canada Supports Ireland"
uob.19.d:0 "The Canadian government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Canadians are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict. Still, Britain is widely expected to ease their policy towards Ireland until the diplomatic climate changes."

uob.20.t:0 "Canada Abandons Ireland"

uob.25.t:0 "Union of Britain Threatens Iceland and the Azores"
uob.25.d:0 "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Entente but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice. A most appropriate answer would be to send out the Royal Navy but this is opposed by many Canadians who prefer further preparations before decisive action against the Union is taken."
uob.25.a:0 "Demonstrate our own power."
uob.25.b:0 "Spend our resources on further buildup."

uob.26.t:0 "The Royal Navy on the Atlantic"
uob.26.d:0 "The King has ordered the Royal Navy to enter the Atlantic in a show of force roughly matching ours. Although the Entente is far too weak for another war we should keep this act in mind should we attempt another demonstration."

uob.26.b:0 "Merde!"

uob.27.t:0 "The Canadians Cower"
uob.27.d:0 "The Canadians did not dare to send their fleet into the Atlantic allowing our force to operate freely. This has shown the power of socialism and weakness of the Imperialist 'great powers'."

uob.32.d:0 "The Royalists in Canada have sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Ireland and declare a ceasefire or Canada will come to Ireland's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the island and secure our vulnerable flank in the event of future conflict, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
uob.32.a:0 "We will not risk war with Canada over this."

uob.33.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Ireland Ultimatum"

uob.43.d:0 "The Union of Britain, those despicable usurpers, has declared war on the Irish state. So far we have only given diplomatic support to Ireland and do not have to intervene.

uob.55.d:0 "The British ambassador has ignored our demands. While we could just pull out of this whole affair we could also announce to the world how these Syndicalist rowdies cannot be reasoned with - it will make us seem a little childish but will have consequences for them as well. However, if we back down from this affair, Ireland will be in dire straits and we will lose face for reneging on our promise to protect them."

uob.64.d:0 "Our worst fears have been realised, the British government has demanded the re-annexation of Ireland. Ireland is to be an oppressed province once again. Although the situation looks hopeless the nation is near universally in favour of fighting until the bitter end, come woe or weal."

uob.67.t:0 "Ireland Submits to Annexation!"

The number of casualties is as-of-yet unknown, but the Maximists pass emergency law after emergency law in order to contain the situation; The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

Some wept for the man, some for the last hope against Mosley's dictatorship."

uob.363.t:0 "The Oil Question"
uob.363.d:0 "It has been decades since we forced the capitalists out, yet we can't rest. Not until they are all defeated will we be safe, but to defeat them the workers spirit will not be enough. There are no two ways about it; without oil our planes, tanks and ships are nothing but scrap, no matter the skill of their crew.\n\nSince we first realised the issue, monumental effort has been spent attempting to cultivate domestic sources of oil. Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures. Fortunately, many saw this coming, and so resources had already been put towards researching synthetic sources of oil. If we divert enough resources in this direction, it may just be possible..."
uob.363.a:0 "It will have to be enough..."

uob.364.t:0 "Support from the Union of Britain"
uob.364.d:0 "Today an envoy from the Union of Britain arrived.

And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."

uobflavour.26.d:0 "For a few years now, a group of artists led by a German emigrant by the name of Hannes Meyer have pushed for their idea of a unified Union of Arts. They argue that 'all arts need to be brought together to create an actual, total work of art, a Gesamtkunstwerk.' Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades.\n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set. Should we establish one Union for all our artists, or leave things as they are?"

uobflavour.27.d:0 "Built as a display hall for the Great Exhibition of 1844, the Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass marvel of the old British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

uobflavour.34.d:0 "After the recent developments in Ireland the British ambassador in Dublin has invited his German counterpart and his attachés for a dinner party to finally alleviate the tension - or at least that's what the German delegation thought. Instead, they found themselves in a Dublin gin joint being served grumpy stew. As they finally left the embarrassing meeting they had to parade through a street filled with Irish socialists cheering on the British delegation. With this spiteful parting gesture however the British campaign against Ireland seems to have come to an end."

uob.500.d:0 "Early on the morning of March 1st a group of men set ablaze a militia training school on the Llyn Peninsula near Penyberth. The men were able to escape despite attempts by the local milita to apprehend them. In the post this morning the Daily Worker received correspondence from the dissident Welsh republican organisation ‘Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru’ or The Wales Home Rule Army claiming responsibility for the attack. They went further to state that similar attacks would take place until Wales was given its independence from English rule. The organisation has been in active opposition to the government in Westminster since 1925 and due to a lack of industrialisation in the North of Wales very little has been done to integrate the republican heartlands into the wider Union of Britain. Only time will tell if more attacks are to come. While the Federationists and Maximists have been quick to condemn the arsonists, Y Glais and the Autononomists have called for a softer hand in catching the arsonists."

uob.501.d:0 "It seems that the arson attacks by the WHRA has inspired their Scottish counterparts to launch a copycat arson in Scotland, albeit much more daring. Attacking a highland militia base in the dead of night they were able to catch most of the men off guard, seize the contents of the armoury and make off into the night setting fire to the base in the process. While the arson attack in Wales was a bloody nose to the Federationist authority, this has been a direct challenge and panic is spreading now that the fringe and obscure Homeland Watch organization has managed to gain arms likely to be used in future terrorist attacks. As the Federationist leaders call for calm, many wonder if they can truly protect the people and the revolution."

Several high-ranking Autonomists and Congregationalists have been captured and taken into custody for questioning with rumours swirling that some prominent Federationists have been executed already. Upon raiding the Welsh Office however, it was found that Niclas Y Glais had fled with important party documents. It is rumoured that there may be informants within the Maximist government who gave Y Glais warning of the raid and he himself has tipped off fellow syndicalists in Cardiff and Edinburgh. Roads leaving London have been closed but Y Glais is yet to be found."

All communications to Wales have been cutoff and allegations that loyal military units there are being murdered in the night by the WHRA remain unsubstantiated. In Scotland the news is much more bleak and it seems the Homeland Watch have assumed full control of the nation from within the shadows with Maximist sympathizers being gunned down in the streets. John MacCormick has came forward as its leader and called on all Scots to resist Moselyite tyranny. While a death warrant has been issued for MacCormick there is one too enforce it and our loyalist military elements struggle to cross the border into Scotland."

A state of open warfare exists between this Scottish Republic and the Union of Britain with our enemies are flocking to recognize the new nation there are rumours that MacCormick's authority is contested by the missing Willie Gallacher and an alternative socialist government. While lacking support, if it manages to oust MacCormick it could appeal to France. Regardless we'll have to wipe out this government now before it can cause too much damage."

Suprisingly in the official announcement of their own UDI, Saunders Lewis, head of the WHRA, was present and admitted a begrudging respect for Y Glais' committment to Welsh autonomy. It appears the two men have put aside their differences and Lewis has pledged allegience to Y Glais' Welsh United Front. While Wales lacks foreign benefactors or even recognition, with the entire Welsh political scene allied against us, they could be a stubborn foe."

uobflavour.31.t:0 "A Matter of Urgency"
uobflavour.31.d:0 "The Revolutionary Police, much like their prior counterparts, are inefficient when it comes to properly tackling threats. It is due to this factor that Mosley was persuaded by his comrades to provide full immunity and power to the MDF. Although not exactly legal, few are in a position to question Mosley’s actions. The MDF have been given permission to investigate unions suspected of disloyalty, in order to better secure the country for Mosley and to make sure no traitors are in our midst. Whilst on one routine inspection inside union headquarters, an MDF detachment under leadership of Comrade Ted Lewis discovered plans for an organised protest to take place directly in front of Mosley’s planned speech at Cable Street. The documents included a list of notable union leaders and politicians who had associated with the planned protest, though it is curious as to why such an important document would be found so easily. Regardless, these inspections are secretive and unknown to union leaders.\n\n If such a protest were to take place, it could have drastic consequences on the Maximist’s perceived power and popularity. Many, including Comrade Lewis, have suggested raiding the homes of those detailed on the list. This could be effective in putting down this opposition however, and forcing the police to exercise such a controversial operation along with blatantly going against Mosley’s stated commitment to freedom and democracy could have even worse consequences..."

After all, are people not at their most free when they are serving the state? The freedom to serve a purpose, to be proud of one’s nation and its achievements, that is the freedom Mosley provides. It is for this reason that under the newly passed Defence Regulation 18B, Mosley authorised a joint MDF-Police operation to arrest those suspected of threatening the peace of the nation. Along with those names on the union’s list for opposition, many who have been suspected of disloyalty without solid evidence too are to be targeted.\n\nPrecisely coordinated raids across London occured with Police dragging out suspected traitors to the revolution. The media arm of the Maximists, Revolutionary British People’s Broadcasting Company, have already stirred up news reports of a traitorous coup foiled by brave comrades such as Ted Lewis. The show of force across the entire city is enough to convince even the most hardcore counter-revolutionary that Mosley’s tight grip over the nation will not be easy to shake..."

If not by Mosley’s grandiose plans for unity and peace then through newly planned “re-education centres”.\nDespite those within his inner circle disagreeing, the Chairman has refused to permit the arrests of politicians and union leaders, their links to this potential protest are dubious at best.

It is clear that the arrests worked, without leadership the opposition was powerless, Biff Boys dealt with any troublemakers brave or stupid enough to cause a scene. This rally at Cable Street, the heart of Mosley’s opposition, represented more than rhetoric. It was symbolic of the Chairman’s control over the entire nation.\n’Let us to Europe and to the world proclaim that the heart of this great people is undaunted and invincible. This flag still challenges the winds of destiny. This flame still burns. This glory shall not die. The soul of Revolution is alive, and England again dares to be great!’"

This was to be no ordinary rally, Cable Street is the heart of his opposition, it would be here that the Chairman would announce his  radical plans of restructuring the nation. Somehow information detailing the dismissed raids had leaked to the public, an already angered populace of union workers and politicians loyal to the formerly Fed/Con controlled TUC were further galvanised by fears that their liberties are at great risk. A united demonstration prepared in the early hours of the morning by constructing makeshift barricades, by midday Mosley had to be escorted in by a convoy of police as the protestors had begun to engage directly with law enforcement. Despite the warnings of the police, Chairman Mosley refused to back down, undeterred he took to climbing on top of his escort van to declare the now rioting crowd of protesters as enemies of the nation. By this point there was no stopping the inevitable chaos.\n\nBiff Boys entered into the fray wielding clubs pushing past police officers and clashing directly with protestors, crowds swarmed each other with nearby buildings being set a torch and windows smashed. Mosley had feared such an escalation of violence would take place, he ordered the military to stand guard, as he witnessed pure mayhem he called for action. Soldiers marched through taking aim at the crowds, scrapping Biff Boys and police officers quickly fled behind the soldiers as a volley of gunfire hit the rioting mob. At once the crowd dispersed allowing the soldiers, police and maximists alike to grab whoever they could. By the end of the day Cable Street was a mess of blood, smoldering rubble and pickets torn apart, Mosley may have won the battle however the war of the populace’s minds was about to begin."

The intention was to create a truly democratic system where for the first time in British history, the workers themselves could rule. However since then the TUC has degenerated into a bureaucratic and corrupt mess of political scheming. It became the new parliament. For this reason Chairman Mosley has decided to rein in the TUC, using his newfound ability to pass legislation allowing for the formation of a National Council. This council will be composed of members elected directly by the people to represent their field of expertise, much like the original goal of the TUC. However these councils will be loyal to the Chairman, they will serve to advise not to broker deals driven for personal gain. All councillors will then personally be approved by Mosley who will accept their democratic victory against their opponents. The TUC has not officially been disbanded, rather reformed into a lower house of government, the TUC will see its influence and political domination destroyed and provided with a new directive.

In Mosley’s society it matters not who you are, a lowly milkman or a brave operative of the R.E.D both serve their part in the machine of the nation. Maximism truly is the ideology for the masses for it preaches the importance of the individual as long as they work in the collective. A single person driven by self interest can achieve nothing, despite their best efforts they will one day die and be forgotten. However millions of people all working together are able to build a utopia, one that will last long beyond their natural lives.

As Mosley pursues his grand ambitions further and further, he has emboldened these foes into what the state has deemed as ‘Anti-Mosleyite Action.’ These rabblerousers will cause detrimental effects to the Mosley regime’s stability, and as such, if the new Chairman seeks to hold onto his newfound position of power, they will have to be dealt with, one way or another.

ENG_england_army_mutiny:0 "Internal Collapse"
ENG_england_army_mutiny_desc:0 "Much of the Union is racked by internal strife as our political and military control over the nation begins to rapidly weaken.

ENG_refugee_crisis:0 "Refugee Crisis"
ENG_refugee_crisis_desc:0 "With Mosley's radical reforms leading to the breakup of the union, many more moderate syndicalists, liberals and political dissidents are fleeing the nation to hopefully find safe refuge in Scotland and Wales."

ENG_synthetic_oil_lover_desc:0 "Domestic oil supplies won't be enough to sustain our military. Fortunately, our synthetic oil tech is nothing short of the best in the world. With the right investment, this may be enough to keep our planes flying, our tanks driving and our ships moving."
ENG_never_surrender_idea:0 "Never Surrender"

# Political Ideas #

#Starting
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_1:0"A Fractured Union"
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_1_desc:0"While unified in purpose, the political divisions in [ENG.GetNameDef] are immense. With continuous factional break-offs, splinter groups, mergers and restructuring resulting in a endlessly shifting landscape in the nation's syndicates, trade unions and cliques. This continued chaos has resulted in a great deal of turmoil for the TUC and political figures attempting to hold the country together, while trying to maintain the principles that the revolution was built upon."
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_2:0"Internal Weakness"
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_2_desc:0"With a reduction to the vast factionalism that once plagued the Union, we can begin to stand stronger than before. However, there is still progress to be made."
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_3:0"A Union United!"
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_3_desc:0"Our purpose unites us all: the Union stands as one against those who wish to see the death of our revolution."
ENG_workers_bastion_idea:0"Workers Bastion"
ENG_workers_bastion_idea_desc:0"Being one of the few truly Syndicalist nations on Earth, the Union attracts a huge number of workers from all across the globe; acting as a haven for those eager to escape the oppression, mistreatment and injustice they face in their own homeland. Our island in the sea shall provide them with the safety they seek in these troubled times."
ENG_global_pariah_Idea:"Global Pariah"
ENG_global_pariah_Idea_desc:"With the revolution came the near-total collapse of the British empire and, along with it, hostility from nations all across the Earth. With very few allies to assist us. With only the Commune of France and the Socialists waging their own war for unification in Italy, the Nation stands as an outcast to the rest of the world.\n\nWhile many of our nation's more elderly citizens recall the vast imports and exotic goods the former United Kingdom enjoyed from her empire, our somewhat isolated global position has allowed us to adapt and innovate with what resources we have available.\n\n§GIf we continue to expand the number Internationale members, our global position will liberate us from this legacy.§!"
ENG_militia_idea:0 "Militia-Based Military"
ENG_militia_idea_desc:0 "Unlike our Communard brothers, who relied in particular on the support of General Maurice Gamelin during their Revolution, most of the important officers of the British army opposed our Revolution in 1925, and many followed the tyrant George V into exile in Canada. As a result, most of our current armed forces are made up of militiamen who, despite their courage and determination, have little talent or experience as officers. It will be necessary to structure this disorganized whole in one way or another if we want to ensure the effectiveness of our army against the imperialists who will without a doubt try to put an end to our young Revolution."

ENG_cable_street_idea_desc:0 "The riots that took place on Cable Street showed the entire nation that not all are loyal to the Chairman, this violent outburst has lead to more members of the Union harshly criticising our administration for the poor planning and response to this confrontation. Our rule is secure and continues to be supported by those in power, but the simple existence of this struggle shows weakness in the Union. The memories of what took place at Cable Street may serve as a battle cry for those opposed to Maximism."

ENG_totalist_party:0 "Maximists/BSP"
ENG_totalist_party_long:0 "Maximists/British Socialist Party\n§gIn the aftermath of the revolution Oswald Mosley was able to cultivate a unique form of syndicalism dubbed 'Maximism', in which society must be radically transformed through the political mobilization of the Unions whole population. While to many this comes across as tyrannical, Mosley has been able to attract like-minded individuals to his cause, including many veterans of the First Weltkrieg such as Wilfred Risdon. Regardless of their popularity among the more aggressive members of the Union, a victory the British Maximists would be surprising due to their aversion to cooperation with other factions and perceived extreme standpoint.\n\nAs well as Oswald Mosley and his followers, diverse groups of both independent thinkers and factions formed from the splinters and break-off cliques from the rapidly shifting landscape of the Union's more authoritarian revolutionaries exist within these circles. The unifying factor between these movements is the desire to move away from the trade unions of Syndicalism and instead move towards centralization behind a strong executive, though the extent of this authoritarianism varies wildly between the different thinkers. While many of these smaller groups exist throughout the nation, a large majority of their members align themselves with the BSP - the British Socialist Party, due to the factions relatively high influence compared to other hardline groups.\n\nFounded by key figures such as R. Palme Dutt, Walton Newbold and Harry Pollitt, evolving and radicalising from its Marxist founding in 1911 due to the Russian Exiles that have greatly influenced the parties thinkers, the BSP seek to wholly transform the nation's overall political structure and centralize the Union under a strong leader as part of a central council of officials. With the backing and political muscle of a highly authoritarian vanguard party to defend and perpetuate the revolution, this council would seek to move the nation away for the distributed power structure that the vast majority of the more mainline socialists seek in an attempt to cement the revolutionary principles that brough them into power in the first place. However, despite the alliance of convenience between the BSP and so called "Hardliners", whom currently have no solidified party or coherent organisation beyond the camaraderie they share, see this exclusion as an act against the revolution, instead believing that the revolution and, more importantly the party, must be flexible and open enough to withstand and adapted to the challenges it may face.§!"

While noble in its aims, the small party was unable to have much impact in British political scene and saw mass defections both during the initial revolution and especially after with most of its former supporters finding a comfortable home in the Autonomists or Federationists. Currently, the Labour party exists as little more than a common denominator for many of the more moderate members of the old government that stayed loyal during the revolution. With members such as Walter Citrine, Ernest Bevin and Charles Simmons all existing as some of the Union's most tempered members that still believe in a nation for the workers.

It continues to be the only legal 'party' in the entire Union though it holds no sway in politics and is considered a non-entity by many.

POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"

POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming tensions wherever they arose and seeking to maintain a delicate balance between all six of the main factions within the nation - which is perhaps why he has continued to leave the growing radicalism that has slowly crept throughout the Union uncontested.\n\nThe former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement - an uncomfortable reality to say the least."

POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following the Federationist victory and Snowden's resignation. Mann, though a Leninist and a life-long ally and friend of Snowden, has shown great historical commitment to the trade union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service.\n\nIn his old age however, he has often received criticism for his unfaltering devotion to Snowden's principles and character, with the brunt of this criticism noting that he is even more elderly then his predecessor."

POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."

POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem 'The Red Flag' is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."

POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."

POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "To some, Lawrence is a New Cromwell, hellbent on shaping England in his dictatorial image. To others, Lawrence is the protector of British Democracy, and the savoir of the nation. Many things can be said about Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg. However, despite people’s views on him, one thing is a fact: His power over Britain is undeniable. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many now fear that his power may go to his head; and he could end up being no better than the man he deposed."

POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement.

While Attlee's army service did instill in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."

POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in an uprising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."

POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."

POLITICS_JOHN_STRACHEY_DESC:0 "Journalist by trade, Maximist disciple and close friend of Oswald Mosley, John Strachey is a name to be reckoned with and has risen exponentially in the Union of Britain. Coming off the back of Mosley's disgraceful collapse, Strachey has been poised to take the reins and has since taken the Maximists away from the cultist devotion that surrounded his friend and mentor. A self-proclaimed 'liberal Maximist', Strachey aligns closely with the economic organisation and principles of the Maximist state but is less so inclined to its totalitarian and ultra-statist philosophy."

POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affairs."

ENG_call_the_tuc:0"Convene the TUC"
ENG_call_the_tuc_desc:0"The time has come once again to convene the Trade Union Congress. Bringing together the representatives for the multitude of unions that make up the nation’s economic workforce and political leadership, the TUC may determine the future of the nation for the foreseeable future. If the rumours are true, and the resignation of Chairman Snowden is imminent, the TUC will serve as an ideal time to elect our new Chairman thanks to the presence of all major political factions in the country, though the Congress may give birth to yet more rivalries and alliances in the process..."

ENG_voice_of_tuc:0"A Voice for the TUC?"
ENG_voice_of_tuc_desc:0"With Snowden's resignation, a temporary speaker is needed for the duration of the TUC. While abiding by the principles outlined in the revolution, there is no doubt that this temporary speaker may try to subtly direct the TUC in the direct that their political alignment wishes to see triumphant."

ENG_domestic_discussion:0"The Question at Home?"
ENG_domestic_discussion_desc:0"The Union has been on a slow decline for many years; internal factionalism, calls for independence in both Scotland and Wales, and increasing radicalism among many of the nation's high profile leaders have put the country on a slippery slope towards total collapse. We must decide at the congress how these problems are fixed, before it’s too late."

ENG_military_discussion:0"Status of the Republican Army?"
ENG_military_discussion_desc:0"Since the revolution, the majority of our defensive and offensive forces have been made up of militia formed during the uprising with little to no direct military training beyond simple use of firearms. While the Republican Army, made up of our forces from the British Army that stayed loyal during the revolution, is extremely small in size relative to the militia formations, these soldiers are adept in combat thanks to proper training and experience. Choosing to dissolve the militias and focus on more traditional warfare techniques, or simply expanding and reforming the militias must be the next point of discussion."

ENG_economy_discussion:0"The Slipping Economy?"
ENG_economy_discussion_desc:0"Our global position was once the most powerful in the world; with vast imports of exotic spices, animals, food and minerals all from the glory of the British Empire. These days are no more; with few allies in the world, our economy is almost entirely based on what resources we can find on our island - if the current trend continues our economy, though adaptable thanks to the Syndicalist and decentralised structure, may soon collapse beyond all repair. The only question is how we go about this solution."

ENG_foreign_discussion:0"Our place in the World?"
ENG_foreign_discussion_desc:0"As the Canadian exiles across the Atlantic and the Germans in Europe continue to eye up our island, we must seriously consider our position in the world. Do we choose to intervene in the socialist struggle that other nation's workers may soon face, or do we focus on our own revolution - along with the defence of both our people and way of life?"

ENG_end_the_tuc:0"Conclude the TUC"
ENG_end_the_tuc_desc:0"As the end of debate and discussion draws near, the votes may be counted for the new British leadership. Despite the promise from all factions; even the BSP and Maximists who are known for their lack of faith in the electoral process, to accept the results of the election, there are high tensions between the different organisations that make up the Congress's main political body. All that remains is to wait for the outcome..."

ENG_1936_Federationist_Victory_desc:0"Being the dominant party in the Union, a Federationist victory is perhaps unsurprising, yet may be what the nation needs in these times. The Federationists reforms so desperately needed can at last being, all while maintaining the foundations and principles that the British workers once fought so hard for."

ENG_FED_embrace_hornerism:0"The Embrace of 'Hornerism'"
ENG_FED_embrace_hornerism_desc:0"Now Chairman, Arthur Horner offers a form of Syndicalism that he has continued to promote since the revolution. The term 'Hornerism' originated as a term for slander against his deviating ideals in the period following the revolution, when radicalism from the BSP had began to rapidly spiral and encroach on many of the more orthodox Syndicalists in the nation. This doctrine, now accepted officially as Hornerism, encourages for the trade unions that pre-dated the revolution to continue their work and evolve into the new unions we seek, rather that the dissolution and reformation into 'revolutionary trade unions' that the BSP have promoted."

ENG_FED_dissuade_direct_action:0"Dissuade Direct Action"
ENG_FED_dissuade_direct_action_desc:0"While our current position and liberation from capitalism was brought about through the dying of our flag red with the blood of many thousands, the time for this action has long past. Our government, already one for the workers and one that will willingly cooperate to improve the lives of all rather than a select few, has often had issues with younger members of the nation still believing that the change they desire can only be brought around through the use of bombs and arson. The most prolific of this group is the WSPU; with its history deeply rooted in militant actions. While their activities have decreased immensely in the past few years, there are still occasional outbursts from a small handful of its members, such as Christabel Pankhurst, who still promotes taking matters into their own hands. By making concessions to the WSPU and wider militant organisations of the Union, we can begin to reduce this infatuation with violent means and encourage cooperation with our administration."

ENG_FED_maintain_cohesion:0"Cohesive and Defined Unions"
ENG_FED_maintain_cohesion_desc:0"Over time, the trade unions have continued to become a bloated and convoluted mess of overlaps, competing interests and contradictory goals. With certain aspects of the economy being comprised of multiple Unions, all with their own unique internal politics, policy, leadership and administration, the ability to easily govern them has become a bureaucratic nightmare; one of the many things we hoped to leave behind in the revolution. By reforming and merging some of these Unions into more defined areas and encouraging collaboration between the Unions of different industries, we can improve both the internal development of our Syndicalist ideals, as well as improve the function of the economy, something that is desperately needed in these times."

ENG_FED_follow_snowden:0"In the Steps of Snowden"
ENG_FED_follow_snowden_desc:0"Philip Snowden, a man whose name will stand eternally as one of the nations most influential figures, has now passed the torch onward to Tom Mann. Mann, a lifelong friend, colleague and proponent of Snowden's chairmanship has promised to continue to walk the tightrope that our nation finds its self standing on. While some fear that Mann will fall victim to the same errors that Snowden is claimed to have enabled, the delicate balance between the factions is yet to be disrupted. By first establishing the desires for each faction and their goals, we can begin the careful process of understanding how best to accommodate their beliefs, without brining on the collapse of our nation from internal divisions."

ENG_FED_stay_the_course:0"Stay the Course, Weather the Storm"
ENG_FED_stay_the_course_desc:0"We will not escape this political disaster we currently face by disrupting the careful balance we find ourselves in. By uprooting and rapidly changing the Union's internal structure, a rapid spiral may trigger the beginning of the end for our nation. Only by standing on our current path, abiding by the Syndicalist foundations we set out in the revolution, slowly reforming where we can and fostering peace between the factions, can we begin to claw ourselves out of this hole."

ENG_FED_discuss_WSPU:0"Make Peace with the WSPU"
ENG_FED_discuss_WSPU_desc:0"Despite the WSPU's continued, and sometimes violent, efforts to elevate the female population, it may finally be time to being working with them. Even with the vast amount of progress we have made towards female emancipation, many of their members are still unsatisfied with the perceived inequality that still exists in the Union. By at last opening negotiations and beginning cooperation with their leading council, consisting of Annie Kenny, Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst, and Teresa Billington-Greig, we can discuss what changes can be made to further close the divide between the two sexes, and perhaps find a new source of labour for our fields and factories in the process."

ENG_FED_intellectuals_socialist:0"The Intellectual's Socialist"
ENG_FED_intellectuals_socialist_desc:0"Cyril Joad, the beloved host of the popular radio show 'The Brains Trust', has promised a new direction for the Union. Not one lead by the humble coal miner and factory worker, but one lead by intelligence and discussion, inspired by the nation's other philosophers such as George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells. Chairman Joad can now begin the monumental task of transforming Syndicalism and Socialism from the ideology of the working man to the philosophy of the nation's intellectuals, teachers and academics, as well as the simple farmer and quarryman."

ENG_FED_ideological_fluidity:0"Promote Ideological Fluidity"
ENG_FED_ideological_fluidity_desc:0"Rejecting the restraints imposed by any single ideology, the new chairman has already promoted the idea of "ideological fluidity". Instead of tying down the nation's political scene to a single form of socialism, Joad has continued to advertise a brand of thinking that carefully examines other socialist ideologies for aspects that can benefit our own. Drawing from the principles of Guild Socialism he follows currently, to Fabianist influences from his early life, orthodox Syndicalism from the wider federationists, and more rarely, the more moderate form of Maximism promoted by John Strachey in Oswald Mosley's own movement."

ENG_FED_rationality_not_radicalism:0"Rationality, Not Radicalism"
ENG_FED_rationality_not_radicalism_desc:0"The ever increasing radicalism has tainted our nation for decades at this point. Initially spiralling from the BSP during the revolution, which was only exacerbated with the arrival of Soviet generals and their more authoritarian brands of socialism, the Union is on its last legs from endless infighting and factional rivalries. We must encourage the masses, many of which are apathetic to the country's leaders on the basis their living conditions do not worsen, to think logically about the decisions they make in regards to their trade unions politics, rather than diving headfirst into the more extreme areas of political thought at the first sign of negative change. Youth movements stand popular with the BSP, the Maximists entice large swathes of our veterans, many women align with the WSPU, leaving us in a position where many would drift away from our movement, unless we can broaden this mantra of logic and reasonable thought."

ENG_FED_rework_the_old:0"Reform through Understanding"
ENG_FED_rework_the_old_desc:0"Harold Laski's victory for the Chairmanship has prompted a swift change in how we shall develop the Union going forward. Instead of seeing the other factions beliefs as a threat to our own way of thinking, we must instead consider why they think like this in the first place. The anger and radicalism that many of the Union's most high-profile thinkers subscribe to has not appeared for no reason; it is our own failings that have brought this on. By understanding why this has happened, and what they wish to see changed, we can begin to cure this extremist way of thinking by tackling the source of the problem directly, rather than simply attempting to treat the symptoms."

ENG_FED_new_economic_architecture:0"The Architect of a New Economy"
ENG_FED_new_economic_architecture_desc:0"As out economy stagnates from lack of potential trade partners, we must carefully consider how every resource available to us is used. Excess production and under consumption both result in wasteful products which will irreversibly drain our limited pool of raw supplies. By establishing a central planning commission for assigning extraction, production and output quotas, we can ensure that only the required materials are produced for both civilian and military needs."

ENG_FED_left_book_club:0"Establish the Left Book Club"
ENG_FED_left_book_club_desc:0"In the development of the socialist utopia we seek, we must ensure that all members of our population, be it young or old, are aware of the journey we are on. The brainchild of Chairman Laski, publisher Victor Gollancz and most surprisingly, Maximist John Strachey, the Left Book Club will seek to spread our message throughout the populace, through books chosen monthly by a panel of thinkers from across the nation's political spheres. This move has already been accepted and praised by groups from almost all of the Union's factions, for its simple and fair approach to selecting which literature is distributed. Some Anarchists, such as Charles Lahr, have even requested multiple copies of the monthly books to sell in their own book stores."

ENG_FED_revolutionary_backbone:0"The Backbone of Any Great Revolution"
ENG_FED_revolutionary_backbone_desc:0"The miners of a country can, at their will, grind the entire nation to a halt with their refusal to work. With no coal or iron, almost all domestic production can be stopped and only started again once they have chosen to return to work. As with our own revolution, with a mass movement of miners and quarrymen as the spine of a movement, revolutions can be incited in almost any well-established economy. We must respect and benefit these men accordingly - they brought upon our own Syndicalist revolution, and may be the key to encouraging many more."

ENG_FED_interloper_accord:0"Review the 'Advisory' Position of Interlopers"
ENG_FED_interloper_accord_desc:0"Generals such as Percy Hobart have always existed in a precarious and uneasy position within the Union's army. It is known they hold contempt for our government, but their military expertise has proven invaluable for our own army's development. The time has come to review the deal that was made shortly after the revolution: should these generals be allowed to maintain advisory positions within the armed forces, or should we at last force them to retire into the background of the nations fighting force?"

ENG_FED_phs_foundations:0"Prepare a Foundation for the PHS"
ENG_FED_phs_foundations_desc:0"To care for the citizens of any society is one of the key purposes of government and administration. A leader who lets their populace fall to sickness, disease and injury is no better than one who actively harms them. By creating the PHS, the Public Health Service, we can ensure that the people of Britain are born healthy, treated throughout their lives, and die painlessly. While this will be costly in the short term and will require constant maintenance, the creation of this service will ensure the good health of all peoples, regardless of their occupation."

ENG_FED_an_education_in_ideals:0"An Education in Syndicalist Ideals"
ENG_FED_an_education_in_ideals_desc:0"The true Syndicalist utopia we seek is not an achievement that will come easily. Vast swathes of our nation still do not truly understand what this entails, with many just being content to live in a nation that values their work and treats them with equality. The majority of workers, almost entirely concentrated in rural areas of farmers, miners and craftsmen, do not grasp the political aspects of the ideology, only the aspects that have a direct effect on their working conditions and livelihood. By implementing new courses in the nation's schools and libraries, we can begin to educate those on what a true Syndicalism should entail. This program will guarantee that those in power of trade unions maintain the line that we have committed ourselves to, lest they risk the workers identifying their transgressions and outing them for their selfish ways."

ENG_FED_individual_assistance:0"Assist Individuals in Need"
ENG_FED_individual_assistance_desc:0"Occupied in their works, many within Britain have found their place as a cog of our Syndicalist machine, rewarded for their efforts and compensated accordingly. There are, however, some who are incapable of work in many of the factories and fields; whether this be from injury, disability, age or illness. By implementing financial or material support for these individuals to assist in their lives, such as specialist positions in administrative roles, we can guarantee a world in which every person works for everyone else. People shall work for the benefit of their peers, and their peers shall work for the benefit of other."

ENG_FED_ally_christians:0"Find Support Among the Nation's Christians"
ENG_FED_ally_christians_desc:0"The declaration that religion be the "opiate of the masses" by Marx has resulted in great numbers of the Protestant and Catholics within our churches to flee during the revolution, resulting in many of them falling into varying states of disrepair. Nevertheless, many devout Anglicans still reside here, following their own blend of Christian teachings with the doctrines of Socialism. By formally building ties with these priests and bishops, our rule can be further legitimised to appeal to Christians overseas, displaying that religion and Socialism can coexist and benefit one another."

ENG_FED_humanitarian_league:0"Reintroduce the Humanitarian League"
ENG_FED_humanitarian_league_desc:0"In 1891, Salt co-founded the Humanitarian League, which aimed to promote humaneness and advocate for social and legal reforms. The League's philosophy was rooted in the belief that scientific advances and evolutionary biology had debunked long-held notions of differences between races, classes, and species, advocating for universal sympathy. "

ENG_FED_union_of_cooperation:0"A Truly Cooperative Union"
ENG_FED_union_of_cooperation_desc:0"It is only through the cooperation of thousands of workers that our revolution was successful in exiling the monarchists and aristocrats all those years ago. We must reinvigorate this same energy: the belief that by working together, we truly can achieve the workers paradise we wish to see descend upon the world. Deployments of propaganda, new radio broadcasts, films and rallies shall all help to bring the Union closer together, regardless of how individuals choose to align themselves. Soldiers will remember every worker that helped create the bullet they fire or the bomb they drop." 

ENG_FED_vulgarity_of_wealth:0"Call Out the Vulgarity of Wealth"
ENG_FED_vulgarity_of_wealth_desc:0"The wealth that has been hoarded by parts of the world is sickening. While natives starve in Africa and toil to the crack of a whip, the Kaiser holds grand balls and lavish banquets for himself and the aristocrats who benefit from this excessive wealth. By reiterating the economic divide between the worlds poorest and richest, we can encourage our population to take action against gaudy displays of wealth and encourage more charitable actions. The sharing of wealth among our citizens should encourage cooperative development in communities which may be struggling, rather then relying on external financial support."

ENG_FED_freedom_of_choice:0"The Liberty to Choose their Lives"
ENG_FED_freedom_of_choice_desc:0"Individual freedom should be our upmost concern. The BSP would see the population formed into a single hegemony where all loyalty is to the party and nothing else, with the Maximists requiring that all individuals involve themselves in the revolution, whether they want to or not. We must respect the choices and alliances that our population chooses to form amongst themselves, even if it goes against our best interest. We will, of course, restrict this to peaceful activites, and any found to be forming subversive groups to assist in hostile invasions will be dealt with accordingly. The formation of sports clubs, cultural groups, and internal communities will strengthen the Union through its diversity."

ENG_FED_pacifism_cool:0"Oppose the Slaughter of War"
ENG_FED_pacifism_cool_desc:0"The First Weltkrieg was by far the most brutal, inhumane and mechanical war the world has ever seen. Endless numbers of young men cut down by constant machine gun fire, blinded in gas attacks and, in some cases, quite literally blown to pieces by artillery shells. These men could have gone on to become the leaders, teachers and doctors of today, but instead lie dead at the will of a small number of individuals. We must oppose these horrors, regardless of what is being fought for; no war is worth the future of a nation, not even an inch of territory is worth any amount of blood."

ENG_FED_peace_by_force:0"Accept the Futility of Pacifism"
ENG_FED_peace_by_force_desc:0"A hard truth to accept, but a truth nonetheless, is that war is unavoidable. As long as there's two people left on the planet, someone is going want someone dead, and there is no use in us cowering from this fact. While pacifism and conscientious objection have always been core tenants of Socialism in Britain, it may finally be time to accept this viewpoint is no longer tenable. There is no use in us refusing to resist when the enemy has stepped foot on our island, with all intention to destroy our way of life."

ENG_FED_born_anew:0"The British Dream Realised"
ENG_FED_born_anew_desc:0"It was nothing but a dream at the end of the TUC, but by a miracle and masterful political manoeuvring, we have done it. The radicals of the Union such as Oswald Mosley and Palme Dutt, while still influential, have withered in popularity enough that they no longer pose a threat to the true Syndicalism that we have now achieved. Moderation, understanding and compromise have triumphed over destructive radicalism and excessive militarism: a truly British union has risen to the task of standing as a Syndicalist beacon of hope for all the world's workers."

ENG_1936_WSPU_Victory_desc:0"The WSPU have come out victorious in the TUC. With its members now in charge of the future planning and development of the Union, it is expected that the unbalanced power that men have experienced for centuries will begin to fade from existence."

ENG_WSPU_expansion:0"Open Up the WSPU to our Allies"
ENG_WSPU_expansion_desc:0"While the WSPU has championed for the rights and development of women since 1903, it has championed for the rights of women only. Men, despite a fair number of them wishing to join, have been banned from joining the organisation and obtaining membership ever since its founding. While other groups, such as 'The Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement' and the 'Men's League for Women's Suffrage' have attracted members in swathes since the revolution, they have never matched the size of the WSPU. By finally removing this ban on male membership and offering the MPU and MLWS an official merging of our organisation with theirs, the ranks of the WSPU will be bolstered massively - improving both our image to the public and the political strength that we wield."

ENG_WSPU_armed_and_ready:0"The People Armed and Ready"
ENG_WSPU_armed_and_ready_desc:0"A war is coming; this is undeniable, and we have no intention of allowing the enemy to reverse the progress we have already made. The men and women of the nation must understand that this war will only be won with the help of them all, no matter their background or experience in combat. With the WSPU's members already having experience with sabotage, concentrated in urban environments, we will begin slow preparation for the inevitable arrival of our enemies."

ENG_WSPU_suffrage_dramas:0"Satirise the Opposition's Weakness"
ENG_WSPU_suffrage_dramas_desc:0"Satire and comedy have always been a core aspect for spreading the Suffrage message; the WSPU was even one of the first groups to use comedic satire to mock our political opponents. This broad appeal of humour allowed for our message to be spread much more rapidly and improve the public image of the group in the process. By reintroducing suffrage dramas with government funding to improve both their quality and scale, tensions that may arise from the changes to the government can be defused through laughter and humour, humanising our movement and the changes that will come with it."

ENG_WSPU_status_of_unions:0"The Status of the Unions"
ENG_WSPU_status_of_unions_desc:0"Christabel Pankhurst, by far one of the most militant members of our movement, has started to discuss the possibility of restructuring the nation’s trade unions. While an extremely small number of the WSPU's members agree with this point, almost entirely members of Christabel's own clique of radical militants, we cannot deny that the trade unions may need reform. The vast majority of senior Union positions in the nation are held by men, and it may finally be time to change their operation to more easily allow for women to both join and progress up the unions ranks. The only question is how far these reforms go, if at all?"

ENG_WSPU_legacy_of_action:0"Take Pride in a Legacy of Action"
ENG_WSPU_legacy_of_action_desc:0"The women of the WSPU have always been women of action, discontent to merely sit idle and hope the change they desire comes on its own and exemplified by its motto "Deeds not words". Instead taking up arms against the government - postal bombings, arson, assassination and improvised explosive were all used to commit a terror campaign the nation had never seen before. This experience can be shared with both the younger members of our movement as well as those in the army; teaching effective use of improvised weaponry against the enemy."

ENG_WSPU_mend_the_divisions:0"Two Movements Sanding as One"
ENG_WSPU_mend_the_divisions_desc:0"While the government has already began to make a change, the internal divisions of the movement are still present; Christabel continues to preach highly militant actions which often agitate the feelings of many of the other movement's more moderate members such as her own sister, Sylvia. By finally and officially merging the WSPU and the WFL to form the PSPU - The People's Social and Political Union, the divisions that have continually hampered the party can finally be put to rest, ushering in a new beginning for equality."

ENG_WSPU_memories_of_martyrs_desc:0"We have been victorious in both the Revolution and our recent election. However, there are those who gave their lives for this day - a day they would never see. Heros of the revolution and the fight for freedom and equality must be remembered and known by all, it is in their memory we must ensure that our way of life never ends."

ENG_WSPU_hunt_cat_and_mouse:0"Hunt Down the Cat and Mouse"
ENG_WSPU_hunt_cat_and_mouse_desc:0"In an attempt to stifle our movement, the now-exiled government introduced varying laws, now referred to as the 'Cat and Mouse' laws for its similarity between a cat toying with its prey before killing it, to shift the blame of our activists mistreatment in prison away from themselves. After force-feeding members of the suffragette movement, prisoners were released until they had recovered from the condition they had developed during their hunger strikes. These prisoners were then re-arrested, with no additional crime being committed, and taken back to prison to continue their sentence; if a activist were to perish during this time of brief freedom, be it from their weakened state or the effects of pneumonia that were common after force feedings, the government would take no responsibility for this death. We must begin to implement reforms and new standards to restrict the creation of such laws under our new administration to prevent this blatant cruelty from ever occurring again."

ENG_WSPU_new_Gretna_girls_desc:0"During the First Weltkrieg, nearly one million women took to the factories to produce arms for the war effort - proving that they were capable of more than society deemed them worthy of, dubbed the 'Munitionettes'. By establishing a program for encouraging female employment in positions "suited for men"; rail construction, mining, factories and more, a new wave of Munitionettes will build this nation to a level of industrialisation never before seen in our history.

Although many of their members also swear their loyalty to Mosley's Maximist party, Sarah Campbell, the wife of Central Council member John Campbell and leader of the LLEx's women's section, has assured that loyalty to the nation first is at the forefront of their movement.

This ends now, our new party shall stand for the revolution, but on its own terms. It is true that the party must defend her people - but it must not be immutable; it must be capable of adapting and changing to meet the challenges it may face, instead of attempting to deceive and lie to the population to protect its own status as an absolute authority."

By improving our relations with key figures such as Annie Kenny, Sylvia Pankhurst, Ernest Allen and Arthur Horner, we can continue to solidify our new party as the legitimate candidates for leadership, rather than being seen as nothing more than an illegitimate coup."

Protest and riots such as these are far more costly to an administration when compared to simply governing their people in a way that they wish to be governed. Our new party will not fall prey to the errors of the previous; we shall protect our population not through fear and paranoia, but through the use of action where necessary, and freedom where possible."

This should not, however, dissuade the individual soldier from committing acts of bravery and heroism on their own accord. An army is only as strong as its individual parts, we must encourage each and every soldier to undertake selfless actions of courage for the survival of the party and our nation."

Headed by Wal Hannington since its founding - a man already a close associate of our current governments inner party members, the NUWM has been a great boon to our nations development, helping those out of work to find employment in almost any form of industry. By officially bringing the NUWM under our own direct control and encouraging membership, those that are still out of work in our nation can easily be directed towards public works projects and development of key industries."

With our successful victory in the now defunct TUC's final congress, the people made their choice - the Union's political scene would no longer exist as a spineless institution, too busy managing the bickering of its figures rather than the tending to the problems that it faced.

Social and Liberal Democracy exist merely as a final attempt to win over the workers support when all other means of control at the disposal of bourgeois societies have failed. All forms of Democracy are simply in place to sustain a world that would allow capitalism to exist: the workers have been led astray by this deception and subterfuge. We will propose a new alliance to our allies, one entirely against any and all bourgeois political, societal and economic control, promising a new revolution to utterly destroy the weakness that plagues the current Internationale."

Regardless of who a person is, where they come from or the god they choose to worship, we must ensure that this opportunity of leadership granted to us does not simply benefit the majority of people, but benefits those often left behind or outcast from society for simply being themselves.

In their sharp black uniforms, the sights of these men marching in parades can begin to slowly convert even the most well entrenched political adversaries towards our cause. By accentuating their image as the Union's protectors with an increase in propaganda and funding, the image of the Biff Boys can be oriented towards a more professional and refined unit, rather than the band of thugs that jump at the opportunity for violence when given the chance."

Outlining a great reworking that would move the nation away from its reliance on foreign imports, a problem that plagues us to this day, towards an Autarkic and Corpocratic system that would be used to revitalise the dying economy that we have suffered with for years. The time has finally come to propose the Second Mosley Memorandum. We must decide on how forcefully this change be required, as attempting to reconstruct our nation's internal workings this early on into our administration may be an unpopular move."

ENG_MAX_wealth_of_isles:0"Extract the Wealth of the Isles"

Beneath out soil lie rich deposits of minerals and metals just ripe for the taking that would be of great benefit to us, there is no reason that untapped resources should sit idle on our island as we continue our path towards true liberation."

We must forge our new revolution around the veterans that have continued to support us and maintain our movements power throughout the years, with Mosley declaring himself representative of the "revolution generation". With the implementation of a new pension program, those who have fought tirelessly for this nation; both on the frontlines and in the trade unions, shall never be forgotten for as long as our leadership holds, as well as potentially encouraging the younger generation to consider a life of military service."

This proof of the systems has made it clear; we must reform the Chairmanship to ensure this legacy continues and our nation may be allowed to thrive even further. With the broad support gained from the Second Mosley Memorandum, one designed to be agreeable to the majority of the Union's factions, the moderate reforms to the Chairman's powers should be widely accepted and encouraged by the nation and its many bickering factions."

It is not only Chairman Mosley that receives this distrust, but the vast numbers of generals, pilots and admirals too that were once members of well-to-do families. This endless slighting and off-handed disrespect must end now, no longer will people be burdened by the name they hold or the house they were raised in; we cannot truly call ourselves a socialist nation if the population still brings up scars of the past for the sake of classist distrust and personal animosity."

Passing additional funding to his department and promoting the creation of great cinematic marvels to promote the order, especially in the wake of the Anarchists rioting, will help permeate the message that Mosley comes not as a dictatorial tyrant, but as a great revolutionary benefactor to the downtrodden people all across our island."

The Maximist Defence Force, or MDF, must be founded from an elite subsection of ideologically devoted soldiers, given specialist training, equipment and missions that many ordinary soldiers would be woefully incapable of undertaking themselves. Despite the additional costs of their training and the time it will take, there is no doubt that a unit of this nature will be greatly beneficial for both its practical application and political leverage and message."

It was fervent nationalism that caused the First Weltkrieg and the horror that many of our compatriots suffered through for nought, with the creation of a supranational European state, this threat of endless wars caused by disputes between nations will come to an end.

Instead, Strachey has made a name for himself both inside and outside of the [chosen_Maximist_party_name] through his more moderate approach to Mosley's own doctrine, foreseeing the slippery slope that true British Maximism may lead the country down.

uob.0.t:0 "The New Britain"
uob.0.d:0 "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany dragged on inconclusively for two years. In 1921, the stalemate was finally broken when Lloyd-George agreed to the German proposal of a "Peace with Honour". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, content to build socialism in isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
uob.0.a:0 "Fascinating."

fractUnion.1000.t:0"Preparing the TUC"
fractUnion.1000.d:0"Before the TUC can officially open and begin the discussions, we must first make the proper preparations. Most important of these is the invitation of the varying trade union representatives and high-profile political figures and their followers that make up the political and industrial workings of the nation. It is expected that the representatives for many of the largest and most influential factions will be arriving soon after the invitations are sent, as this is an occasion that many of their leaders have been anticipating.\n\nIf the rumours are true and Chairman Snowden does intend on stepping down, candidates for the new Chairman, or a potential Chairwoman, will first need to be proposed by each faction before the TUC can being its debates as to the direction of our ailing nation."
fractUnion.1000.a:0"Send out the invitations at once."

fractUnion.1.t:0"Philip Snowden Steps Down"
fractUnion.1.d:0"In a move that has shocked very few of the Union's officials, the ageing Chairman, Philip Snowden, has announced his immediate resignation. Citing a multitude of factors such as his advanced age, ailing health from stress, time with his family and guilt over how the Union has deteriorated under his chairmanship, the now former Chairman announced his resignation through a speech broadcast to the nation.\n\nWhile this comes as no surprise to the vast majority of people, with many even praising his efforts and decision to step down before the worst occurs, many more are concerned that this move will only draw the nation into further chaos as the TUC begins; claiming Snowden was the thing keeping the Union together, and peace between the factions..."
fractUnion.1.a:0"An unsurprising move, but perhaps poorly timed."

fractUnion.2.t:0"The WSPU-WFL Arrive at the Congress"
fractUnion.2.d:0"The first of the prospective factions to arrive has been the WSPU-WFL, made up of a coalition between the Women's Social and Political Union and the Women's Freedom League. While acting as a single unified party, the WSPU-WFL coalition is split between its more moderate members, such as Teresa Billington-Greig, who wish to abide by the democratic process of the Union no matter what, operating within the nation's legal bounds. The more militant leaning members however, such as the Pankhurst sisters Christabel and Sylvia, and Annie Kenny, believe that in times where a government refuses to acquiesce to the demands of the people, direct action must be taken - though many believe that Christabel Pankhurst takes the desire for militant action far beyond the necessary or desired amount.\n\nIf they are to be successful in the upcoming election, a candidate for the first potential Chairwoman is required from them; who should it be?"
fractUnion.2.a:0"Annie Kenney is chosen as candidate."
fractUnion.2.b:0"Christabel Pankhurst is nominated for the position."
fractUnion.2.c:0"Sylvia Pankhurst is nominated."
fractUnion.2.e:0"Teresa Billington-Greig is selected."

fractUnion.3.t:0"The Anarchists Arrive at the Congress"
fractUnion.3.d:0"Arriving surprisingly early considering their strong dislike for the Union's politics, the United Socialist Movement have arrived at the congress. Acting as its current organiser, it is expected that Guy Aldred will be nominated as their prospective candidate due to his effectiveness at catering to the wildly diverse organisation. While skilled at reducing tensions due to his willingness to work with other factions, other candidates such are making clear their desire for nomination.\n\nIn recent years, Charles Lahr, most known for his small publishing operation that has helped to slowly grow the USM's popularity, has gained many friends in the literary and artistic circles. This business has elevated him as popular candidate with many among the Anarchists - though his extremely brief time as a member of the British Socialist Party, once much more moderate than the organisation is has become today, has caught the ire of some of the most devout members of the USM.\n\nIn addition to Aldred and Lahr however, members such as Leah Feldman, who remains a highly popular figure among many of the Eastern-European migrants and political refugees, as well as the nation's Bundists due to both her Ukrainian birth and Jewish heritage. Standing as another candidate, Ethel Mannin, who often finds herself subtly supported by many of the WSPU's members on issues due to her popular writings and continued support for women's suffrage, has also made clear her desire to be nominated."
fractUnion.3.a:0"Guy Aldred, current organiser of the USM."
fractUnion.3.b:0"Charles Lahr, friend of many writers, is nominated."
fractUnion.3.c:0"Leah Feldman is proposed."
fractUnion.3.e:0"Anarcha-Feminist Ethel Mannin will serve the Union well."

fractUnion.4.t:0"The Federationists Arrive at the Congress"
fractUnion.4.d:0"With Snowden's resignation, Arthur Horner was named as the desired successor for the former Chairman. While remaining a popular figure among the Federationists due to his relatively moderate beliefs, even being a respected figure by many of the nation's Autonomists such as Niclas Y Glais due to his contribution to the Miners Federation in South Wales, some have questioned if abiding by Snowden's wishes would be our best move. Stating the continuous increase in radicalism as their main concern, in combination with fears that Horner would too closely follow Snowden's doctrine of merely keeping the peace rather than curbing the more extreme factions. Despite this, Horner has made clear that we will not simply follow what has already been written, but instead take a stance against this extremism.\n\nHowever, in spite of Snowden's wishes, Tom Mann may act as an alternative to Horner. Mann has the advantage of being more senior than his associates which has allowed him to develop a much stronger relationship with the former Chairman, knowing Snowden well and being well liked in return, though his age has raised numerous concerns. Mann is himself even more elderly than Snowden, and it has been feared that he may succumb to illness far sooner than hoped. Nevertheless, his advanced age has been brushed off by many having been a strong supporter of Syndicalism for nearly his entire life, though he may experience the harsh criticism that Snowden faced for his age and be seen as a individual from an age of Syndicalism that has passed.\n\nFor this reason, both C.E.M Joad; popular for his ardent pacifism throughout the First Weltkrieg as well as his fairly flexible outlook on the nation's future, and Harold Laski have been raised as prospective candidates. Laski, despite receiving political attacks for his supposedly 'antithetical' ideology, remains highly popular among many of the more senior members of the TUC due to his time as a lecturer, with vast numbers of these members once being his students and somewhat inheriting aspects of his ideology themselves."
fractUnion.4.a:0"Arthur Horner, current General Secretary of the Union and Snowden's requested successor."
fractUnion.4.b:0"His age is not a concern if his devotion makes up for it; Tom Mann is nominated."
fractUnion.4.c:0"Popular thinker and controversialist Cyril Joad is nominated."
fractUnion.4.e:0"Harold Laski, despite his somewhat inconsistent ideology, is selected."

fractUnion.5.t:0"The Autonomists Arrive at the Congress"
fractUnion.5.d:0"Next to arrive at the TUC are the so called Autonomist faction. Made up of many of members from the Union's constituent nations, Scotland and Wales, the Autonomists exist as once of the most politically moderate bodies in the nation. Still strongly Syndicalist, some often consider the Autonomists as a 'single issue group', with much of their movement united under the sole ambition for higher levels of independence and devolution in the Union, they often find themselves continually under attack by both the BSP and Maximists. Whether this be achieved through national councils established in the home nations' territory, independence from the Union while maintaining military, economic and political ties, or most radically, complete and total independence from England, the Autonomists have continually failed to make a great impact on the TUC's outcomes due to their relatively small appeal.\n\nThis however, has often meant their allies come from places that many find confusing or unexpected, where desperation has forced them to relinquish certain policies in favour of increased political support. Overtime, allies have included members of the USM such as Scottish-born Anarchist Ethel MacDonald, leading figure in the Red Clydeside era Willie Gallacher, and varying members of Christian Socialist movements such as Anglican priest John Groser. These allies have at times even included members of Cornish Nationalist movements such as the group Tyr ha Tavas, that would see Cornwall become its own independent, self-governing state, though many believe that this movement pushes the limits of the Autonomist's capabilities."
fractUnion.5.a:0"Niclas Y Glais, the Autonomists' current leader is nominated."
fractUnion.5.b:0"Willie Gallacher, a hero of the Red Clydeside era, is chosen as candidate."

fractUnion.6.t:0"Radicals Arrive at the Congress"
fractUnion.6.d:0"The final of the main factions to arrive has been both the BSP, representing the most ardent Socialists in the Union under the leadership of Palme Dutt and the party's Central Council, as well as Oswald Mosley's clique of Maximists. Due to their outlining party structure and faction loyalties, there is no doubt that Palme Dutt will be the nominated candidate for the BSP, and Oswald Mosley representing the Maximists.\n\nWith their arrival, the nation’s main representatives of the varying factions, trade unions and interest groups have convened, and the congress may at last begin. The outcome of this congress may determine the future of the Union, so we must carefully consider how each issue be resolved."
fractUnion.6.a:0"Let us begin then."

fractUnion.7.t:0"The TUC's Temporary Speaker"
fractUnion.7.d:0"With the resignation of the now former Chairman Philip Snowden, a newly chosen interim speaker will be required for the TUC. In charge of directing the congress and ensuring all topics are discussed in both a timely and civilized matter, the Speaker may hold a great amount of sway over the overall outcome of the TUC, whether it be for better or for worse. Who should fill this role of Speaker?"
fractUnion.7.a:0"Mosley is a fierce orator - he will control things well."
fractUnion.7.b:0"Dutt of the BSP will ensure things go smoothly."
fractUnion.7.c:0"Go with Aldred from the USM, he is well versed in balancing factionalism."
fractUnion.7.e:0"Let Niclas of the Autonomists direct the TUC."
fractUnion.7.f:0"Horner was a friend of Snowden, best we go with him."
fractUnion.7.g:0"Annie Kenny has always been skilled at public speaking."

fractUnion.8.t:0"Discussion of the Union's Internal Structure"
fractUnion.8.d:0"With the recent increase in both radical movements and factionalism, the domestic policy of the Union has become a hotly debated topic.\n\nThe Maximists and BSP, while both advocating for a much stronger executive and curbing of pacifism common in other factions such as the Federationists, differ in opinion on how this should be done; the Maximists advocating for the mass movement of all of the Union's citizens in defence of the revolution, while the BSP state that only a strong party can defend the nations people - rooting out those deemed a threat in the process.\n\nThe Anarchists, expectedly, oppose this notion; stating that the convoluted nature of the Union's politics stands in the way of true freedom. They wish to further reduce the control that the congress holds over the nation, liberating the nations people in the process.\n\nWhile agreeing somewhat with the Anarchists, the Autonomists deem that the Union's home nations; England, Scotland and Wales, must be allowed to choose their own future, but a political and military alliance between them should still be maintained for the mutual benefit of all.\n\nThe Federationists, having ruled the Union for just over a decade at this point, seek to continue the status quo that has brought the revolution this far, while defending against both more authoritarian radicals who believe the revolution has failed to go far enough and those who would wish to see the revolution undone entirely.\n\nRepresenting the interest of the nation's women, the WSPU have been petitioning to close the divide between the sexes even further, pointing out the comparatively large number of high-ranking political and military figures that are men, with relatively few of the nation’s influential political positions being filled by women, as proof that there is still a bias within the Union's politics."
fractUnion.8.a:0"Mosley is right - everyone must play their part."
fractUnion.8.b:0"The BSP make an excellent point - the party must defend her people."
fractUnion.8.c:0"The Anarchists are correct - the Union has become too restrictive."
fractUnion.8.e:0"The Autonomists know what’s best - push for devolvement."
fractUnion.8.f:0"The Federationists have gotten us this far - stick with the status quo."
fractUnion.8.g:0"The WSPU win out - push for equality above all."

fractUnion.9.t:0"Status of the Republican Military"
fractUnion.9.d:0"With ever increasing tensions in the world, the status of our military, or lack of military, has been chosen to be discussed next. Currently, the majority of the defensive and offensive foot soldiers in our nation consist of disorganised militia with no strong command structure, instead relying on officer independence and initiative to make the majority of tactical decisions. While a very small number of 'official' Republican Army divisions with proper training and equipment exist - many being left over from the first Weltkrieg, they are so few in number that in the event of a wide-scale conflict, they would be useful as little more than shock troops.\n\nWe must decide how this restructuring will come around - if at all. While it would be wise to follow through on these plans, many of the nation's more senior figures understand that our army may have to adapt to suit our needs when required, as opposed to trying to plan an entire wars outcome before its even begun."
fractUnion.9.a:0"The Maximists prove correct - our Army must be aggressive." #mobile warfare - tank focus bc veterans wouldnt want a bloody war/liddell hart
fractUnion.9.b:0"Dutt's BSP take this one - we must overrun our enemies." #mass assault - infantry focus
fractUnion.9.c:0"The USM are right - maintain army flexibility." #general (As in boost to generals) boosts - not encouraged to take any doctrine
fractUnion.9.e:0"The Autonomists know what to do - push for officer initiative." #general boots + grand battle
fractUnion.9.f:0"The Federationists plan - develop the Republican army and expand the militias separately." #grand battle + special forces + militia
fractUnion.9.g:0"The WSPU win out - our people’s lives are valuable." #artillery focus

fractUnion.10.t:0"Direct the Crumbling Economy"
fractUnion.10.d:0"The great loss of our global hegemony that resulted from the revolution came as somewhat of a shock to our economy; with no prior adjustment, our entire nation underwent one of the greatest territorial losses the world has ever seen in a matter of weeks. While our Syndicalist nature has allowed for a fairly swift reorganisation of industry, both military and civilian, to suit out current situation, the effects of what was lost can still be felt in the slow stagnation that the Union has experienced over the past decade. Now fully reliant on whatever resources we have on our island and those available to our few allies, a new change may be needed for our economic direction. We must decide what this direction be - though the bickering factions may make this difficult."
fractUnion.10.a:0"We must centralise and militarise as per Mosley's vision."
fractUnion.10.b:0"Dutt is correct - nothing short of total militarisation will suffice."
fractUnion.10.c:0"An agrarian approach praised by the USM will benefit our many farmers."
fractUnion.10.e:0"The Autonomists approach - a hybrid structure is the best of both options."
fractUnion.10.f:0"Mix civilian and military industrialisation - the Federationists' plan."
fractUnion.10.g:0"Follow the WSPU's ideas - focus on civilian works."

fractUnion.11.t:0"The Nation's Place in the World"
fractUnion.11.d:0"Our revolution has transformed our nation from a fiefdom of kings and aristocrats to a workers paradise, but this new-found liberty did not come for free. The power and influence that the British Empire once held has now crumbled to dust, with what little influence the empire had left now cowering in Canada. Despite our influence among many of the worlds current governments, we hold a huge amount of influence among the socialist governments and political groups that live under the surface in much of the world. The point of discussion has come to this; how should we support these governments and groups, if at all, despite the numerous problems we face on our own island?\n\nThe Maximists and BPB both support similar notions of direct intervention through the use of supplying equipment and volunteer divisions when possible, though many in the Union's more moderate circles believe that this will be perceived as hostile actions and foreign meddling.\n\nThe Autonomists have voiced the belief that only intervention in wars of "liberation" should be considered, believing we should ignore intervention in aggressive wars of expansion and instead focus on promoting self-determination for oppressed minority groups and independence movements. Though this contrasts with the USM's belief that foreign intervention of almost all kinds - outside of volunteer forces of course, should be avoided due to a belief that this intervention is just another tool for governments to exert their influence.\n\nClosely allied, both the Federationists and WSPU believe in foreign intervention where necessary. The Federationists proposing that we should first focus on the defeat of Germany and Canada as they both pose as an active threat to the nation, while the WSPU have often stated we should first focus on internal development and evolution before turning are view outwards."
fractUnion.11.a:0"Do as the Maximists say - the masses must be uplifted."
fractUnion.11.b:0"We cannot stand idle, the BSP know that revolutions will not happen on their own."
fractUnion.11.c:0"Authoritarianism must come to an end, Side with the USM."
fractUnion.11.e:0"The Autonomists are right - promote self-determination for the oppressed."
fractUnion.11.f:0"The Federationists line hasn't failed us so far - focus on Canada and Germany first."
fractUnion.11.g:0"As per the WSPU, we must improve the Union and uplift the nations women."

fractUnion.12.t:0"An Unexpected Alliance"
fractUnion.12.d:0"Seeing their lack of influence this far into the TUC, in a move that has caught the ire of the other factions, the Autonomists and United Socialist Movement have formed a shaky coalition in an attempt to use their combined support to achieve a majority in the congress. While many members in the USM and broader Anarchist circles strongly disagree with the Autonomists' desire for devolution - seeing it as nothing more than giving into regional nationalism by drawing additional lines and borders between the population, many among the USM's Anarcho-Syndicalists have often championed for working with alternate groups when necessary, this being one of those times.\n\nWhile this may be insignificant in the long term, the leaders of both groups are hoping that if success comes for either the Autonomists or Anarchists in the final discussion of the TUC, the coalition may just be enough for them to grasp victory from the other more dominant factions. Despite the influence of the Anarchists in this alliance, it is expected that the Autonomists will wield the majority of the political power in an attempt to keep the peace in the Union, understanding that the fierce hatred that both the BSP and Maximists have towards the Anarchists may rapidly destabilise the nation further."
fractUnion.12.a:0"Will this be enough for them to win?"
fractUnion.12.b:0"Prevent this coalition by any means!"

fractUnion.13.t:0"The results are in!" #(all separate events bc it makes testing easier/not having one insanely long event with a billion checks, but they all use the same loc excluding the button)
fractUnion.13.d:0"With the closure of the TUC and an end to the debates, the votes have been counted and a new leader for the nation has been chosen. A new age for the Union may soon begin; with many hoping the factionalism and infighting that has tainted the nation for years may soon come to an end."
fractUnion.13.a:0"Congratulations to comrade Mosley and the Maximists!"
fractUnion.14.a:0"Congratulations to comrade Dutt and the BSP!"
fractUnion.15.a:0"A surprise victory for the Autonomists!"
fractUnion.16.a:0"The Anarchists have been victorious!"
fractUnion.17.a:0"Another victory for the Federationists!"
fractUnion.18.a:0"The WSPU have won!"

fractUnion.1002.t:0"No Clear Winner at the TUC!"
fractUnion.1002.d:0"In a rare disaster, the TUC has failed to identify a clear favourite for the new Chairman. With no clear winner many have already started to raise support for the more authoritarian factions to avoid outcomes such as this, with all factions seeming determined to remain independent without the formation of coalitions or alliances only worsening the situation. Foreseen as a potential issue, previously established protocol dictates that the current leadership, that by technicality being the Federationists' Arthur Horner due to the resignation of Philip Snowden, has final decision in the outcome.\n\nWhile it is no surprise, Horner has dictated that the Federationists will continue their tenure. Stating that, by breaking from the expected and choosing leadership outside of his own supporters, the nation would only further destabilise into the mess of infighting and disagreement it has become accustomed to."
fractUnion.1002.a:0"Perhaps not the victory they hoped for..."

fractUnion.19.t:0"Outrage from the Anarchists!"
fractUnion.19.d:0"Forever hateful towards the Union's endless intervention into the people's will and even more hateful to the more authoritarian-leaning members of the Union, a huge number of Anarchists have descended onto the streets of the nation in protest of the new government. Claims that this will be the end of freedom for the Union's people have started a fire among the USM's leaders, with both peaceful and violent resistance emerging in the cities, towns and villages all across Britain. We must act quickly before the violence tears the Union apart."
fractUnion.19.a:0"Something must be done, and fast!"

fractUnion.20.t:0"Scotland and Wales Declare Independence!"
fractUnion.20.d:0"In the chaos that the Anarchists have caused, our forces have been stretched far too thin in battling their attempts to destabilise the government, resulting in the vast majority of our political control over areas of the nation vanishing. Seeing the degrading stability in the nation and the mismanagement of the crisis by [ENG.GetLeader], both Scotland and Wales have declared their independence from the Union! Until this crisis has been solved, there may be little we can do to stop them.\n\nIt seems that our local supporters in Wales have turned on us and given allegiance to a resurgent Glais and his rebel government Cardiff. Surprisingly in the official announcement of their own UDI, Saunders Lewis, head of the WHRA, was present and admitted a begrudging respect for Glais' committent to Welsh autonomy. It appears the two men have put aside their differences and Lewis has pledged allegiance to Glais' Welsh United Front. While Wales lacks foreign benefactors or even recognition, with the entire Welsh political scene allied against us, they could be a stubborn foe.\n\nThe situation in Scotland appears much more unstable, with the Homeland Watch more or less controlling the nation. With this state of open warfare between ourselves and this new Scottish Republic, our enemies have already began flocking to recognize the new nation; there are rumours that MacCormick's authority is contested by the missing Willie Gallacher and an alternative socialist government, though it can't currently be confirmed if these rumours are true. While lacking support, if it manages to oust MacCormick it could appeal to the Algerian regime for support.\n\nThe sitation in England has began to rapidly deteriorate: if the Anarchists manage to fully destabilise the country, who knows what could happen - we must solve this problem before it’s too late!"
fractUnion.20.a:0"The Union is no more!"
fractUnion.20.b:0"Freedom at last! (Play as Scotland)"
fractUnion.20.c:0"Freedom at last! (Play as Wales)"

fractUnion.21.t:0"T.E. Lawrence Intervenes!"
fractUnion.21.d:0"With our complete failure to contain the Anarchists, T.E. Lawrence along with the backing of vast swathes of the country's military, as well as many militia elements formed in defiance of the previous government, stormed the capital today. Hastily arresting government officials and declaring a state of emergency in the Union, an interim military government has been established while the Anarchists are dealt with. Already, many figures in the USM such as Guy Aldred and Charles Lahr have called off the protest out of fear for the Republican military's training and equipment, the respect that Lawrence wields and for their own self-preservation - though it is expected that many of the ringleaders will face harsh punishment for the damage and instability their have caused already. As the Republican Army's advance begins, a new day may be dawning for the Union."
fractUnion.21.a:0"The end of normality, or beginning of something new?"

#event if you win but home nations break free
fractUnion.22.t:0"Anarchist resistance begins to wane"
fractUnion.22.d:0"As efforts to counteract the Anarchists resistance have started to take effect, with the governments grip on the nation growing stronger by the day, it appears we have won. While widescale damage to both our industries and the population's trust in the government has been left in the wake of this rebellion, it has only shown the state of disrepair that our once great Union has fallen into. Both Scotland and Wales have managed to establish their independence from us during the chaos and, while we are in no state to reclaim their lands and reform the Union, one day soon our people will stand united once again."
fractUnion.22.a:0"Perhaps only a pyrrhic victory..."

While widescale damage to both our industries and the population's trust in the government has been left in the wake of this rebellion, it has only shown the state of disrepair that our once great Union has fallen into. Though perhaps this rebellion was not entirely wasteful: using the instability and fear that many felt from the chaos, we may push forward the reforms the nation so desperately needs to ensure a crisis such as this can never occur again on the island we call home."
fractUnion.23.a:0"The first victory of many!"

fractUnion.24.t:0"Syndicalist Allies Found?"
fractUnion.24.d:0"After a brief investigation to some of the more authoritarian members of our Syndicalists trade union connections, two members have stood out to us. Frank Haxell and Frank Foulkes, both members of the Electrical Trades Union and both men who have a disdain for the stagnating positions they find themselves stuck in, may be promising candidates for influence in the Federationists faction. After a brief contact was made to them outlining our need for support, they have come back with their own terms for this potential alliance.\n\nIn exchange for their political leverage in the nation’s industrial unions, Haxell and Foulkes have both asked that we assist with their current political status both within ETU as well as the broader nation. Frank Foulkes, the older of the two men, has stated he intends on running for the position of the ETU's President and has no interest of political gain outside this trade union. Frank Haxell on the other hand has made it clear to us his ambitions, which are far greater than Foulkes'. Instead of asking for subversive support in an election, Haxell as requested that in exchange for his support, we bring him in as an official member of the Central Council - one wielding much greater influence than his current trade union position.\n\nWhile the plans for this new position will not be made public until after we have secured our rule from the terror of the Anarchists, this is no doubt a blatant violation of the democratic process that many of the trade unions thrive on. These are however, the very same principles that cornered our nation into this state in the first place, ones that we will be sure to change in the coming years of our rule. Should we follow through on these plans and gain a new area of influence and Council Member, or choose to reject them and make do with our own party's already growing power?"
fractUnion.24.a:0"Very well - they have our support."
fractUnion.24.b:0"They ask for too much, no deal."

fractUnion.25.t:0"Completion of the Army Purge"
fractUnion.25.d:0"After further gathering of information beyond the subtle whispers and rumours heard by low-ranking officers, a full investigation was conducted into the senior command and 'Advisors' of the Republican Army. With this concluded, shocking discoveries were made as to the loyalties of certain individuals, most notably Percy Hobart and a small clique of the named 'Old Guard'. This small clique, made up of many officers of the former British Army that entered an uneasy alliance with Snowden's government after the royal family cowardly fled the country, remained in the Union and thereby destroyed any loyalty that these commanders held to their now-former administration. This did not mean they were automatically loyal to our government however, as it would appear the current chaos had emboldened their desire for a Syndicalism-free Britain.\n\nIn discovering this transgression and the removal of ringleader Hobart, as well as the removal of some more outspoken individuals in the armed forces, this threat of an internal rebellion from some of our Armies most skilled individuals has been put to rest."
fractUnion.25.a:0"A bold move, but necessary."

fractUnion.27.d:0"With the expansion of the Internationale, our potential trade partners, political allies and economic influence have all grown to a point that has allowed us to break free from our status as an isolated global power. As more moderate socialist nations across the world recognise that the Syndicalist revolutions taking place are not merely a temporary moment in history, a slow increase in our nations recognition has begun and allowed us to break free from these chains of isolation."

fractUnion.29.d:0"After the embarrassing failure we suffered against the Anarchists, both Scotland and Wales have stood as a sad reminder of this defeat. Our newly reinvigorated strength however, has afforded us the opportunity to reclaim these lands: to at last reunite our island and restore the Union to its former glory.

fractUnionFlav.1.d:0"Traditionally a stronghold of Liberals and Tories, Cornwall has continued to be a thorn in the side of the Nation. Lacking any kind of a major urban centre the unionist movement is virtually non-existent, resulting in the government turning to quite unexpected allies in order to secure the county - the Cornish revivalists. Beginning at the dawn of the 20th century, it is the region’s only movement involved with leftist politics in any way. Some detractors claim it is connected to the now defunct Order of the White Rose, a neo-jacobite organisation that existed before the First Weltkrieg, or even the hermetic order of Order Templi Orientis, however those rumours were swiftly, maybe even carelessly, dismissed by the government.\n\nCornish revivalism is first and foremost represented by the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies, and a political group connected to it - Tyr ha Tavas (Land and Language); their efforts are mostly focused around promoting the Cornish language, over time however, they have turned toward the cause of Cornish regionalism and in rare cases, even nationalism. Another organisation important to the movement is Gorsedh Kernow - the Cornish Federation of Bards, to which the overwhelming majority of figures significant to the revival belong. Most recently Cornish Revivalism has gained another prominent advocate - Helena Charles, a notable Christian Socialist and humanitarian involved in charity work in various slums around Britain. Gaining notoriety as a more radical advocate of Cornish home rule, or as some rumours claim independence, even attempting to form a more coherent party to support her aspirations in the process. Revivalists have proven to be reliable allies so far in promoting many of our socialist ideals, but nobody can say what their true plans are for the county and more importantly, how this burgeoning support for Cornish independence will effect the Union in years to come."

fractUnionFlav.2.t:0"A Whalesale Failure" #thank you Jormund
fractUnionFlav.2.d:0"As the forces of the Third Internationale and Reichspakt clash on the European continent, the British Isles have found themselves at a rather dire problem of food supply. During the Weltkrieg, the Royal Navy remained too large for the Germans to contest openly, and thus the issue never really arose at the time, but now, the Kaiser’s fleet has been more than capable of contesting the Union’s naval forces, and supply of everything from meat to coffee and other goods is becoming increasingly strained. The lack of proper meat products has led to increased rationing from the government of the Union as well as local councils, and this has allowed a strange contender to emerge as an alternative to the more traditional pork and beef. Whale meat is not a central part of the British cuisine in the slightest and while the British took part in the global race to hunt the sea creatures to near extinction, this was mainly for the oil and bones of these leviathans, not their meat. The meat is roughly comparable to that of horse meat in status, not inedible but generally considered taboo or disgusting. However, desperate times have called for desperate measures, as German interception makes even fishing somewhat difficult, and thus, experiments in the use of whale meat have become commonplace.\n\nThere has even been a drive to exclude whale produce from the rationing programs, but unfortunately, it would appear that all these tests and promotions have been for naught. Whale meat emits a very strong stench as it is being prepared, akin to fish, and if it is thawed too slowly, it becomes pulpy and rather difficult to eat. Usual whale dishes would be served almost swimming in gravy and buried under a mountain of vegetables to avoid the telltale smell and the hard texture of the meat, while some innovative souls attempted to create a bacon-like product, quite literally called 'wacon' or 'whacon', as an alternative. None of these have helped fix the issue of the meat being simply too foreign for many to eat, and even cats reportedly avoided it like the plague. Despite many hopeful attempts, it seems to be the case that Britain will have to find a new source of meat for the masses."

fractUnionFlav.4.t:0"In Support Without Fighting"
fractUnionFlav.4.d:0"The Quakers, with their undying commitment to pacifism, have always faced criticism in times of war. Denying any and all attempts to take up arms in the face of potential invasion, there has always been strong discussions over their status during these troubled moments. While some would see them arrested or interned for their objections to conflict, it would appear that new options have gained much more traction over the last few decades, with the advent of mobile ambulance units.\n\nThe Friends' Ambulance Unit, commonly referred to as the FAU, has already begun their efforts to support the nation while maintaining their testimony of peace they they all undertake. Only three days after the outbreak of the First Weltkrieg, Philip Noel-Baker assisted with the organisation for an independent ambulance unit; foreseeing the severely undersized and underquoted units the British Army was fielding at the time. Roughly one month after this initial meeting, the first training camp was established for this new unit and began its work in preparing the men and women for service in the war, without the support of either the British Army or the British Red Cross. The situation changed however, following the collapse of the Belgian army and the Kaiser's march into the lowlands. A party, led by Noel-Baker, was given supplies and were destined for Belgium and arrived unharmed; though a stop was made to assist the crew of a sinking cruiser. After a return trip to Dover, the FAU established its headquarters in Mao les Bains, nearby to Dunkirk where several thousand soldiers lay injured from their time in the trenches.\n\nWith casualties mounting, the FAU was expanded, bringing in many non-Quakers in the process. After giving further assistance across mainland Europe, such as in Italy with their entrance in the war, the Anglo-Italian Ambulance Unit was created to assist with administrative tasks and logistical support. By the latter years of the war, approximately 1360 men and women worked as part of the FAU, driving over a collective two million miles. There is no doubt that the contribution from these pacifist helped save the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers from wartime wounds and injury. With there growing support in our current conflict, our men can feel confident that a friend will always be nearby to treat them when needed."

fractUnionFlav.7.d:0"In a age so riddled with instability and fear, the individuals that remain cheerful and smiling in times of strife have been called both indomitable and insane. Beloved by many members in the horse racing scene, the famous tipster Prince Monolulu, whose real name is Peter Carl McKay, has acted as a attention grabbing individual for racegoers since 1903.\n\nOriginally born in the West Indies though claiming to be from Ethiopia, Monolulu arrived in the country in 1902 after an extensive trip which has taken him thousands of miles. From his own accounts, he managed to make his way to the coast of Africa where he was first crimped into a sailing crew by a British vessel. Though doubts are raised as to his supposed shipwrecking on the Portuguese coast, most likely travelling via Puerto Rico, Monolulu ended up in New York city where he held a variety of jobs and eventually made his way to London. The choice to style himself as a Prince came from his crimping, when he had hoped that this claim of royalty would permit him better treatment - though judging by his near endless travels it is yet to be seen if this title made any difference.\n\nRapidly establishing himself as a common figure at the races as a tipster, with his first visit to the Epsom Derby in 1903, Prince Monolulu has become a common and beloved sight to the racegoers - most notably for the bright ostrich feathers he can be seen wearing in his hat and the lion's claw swinging from his neck. Along with the visual spectacle, the catchphrase of "I gotta a horse" signifies to all spectators as to Monolulu's location, assisting in his business as a tipster; providing information on the horses and their jockeys, for a price of course. This business was given a great surge in customers when, in 1920, Monolulu successfully determined that Spion Kop would win - even with the predicted odds of 100-6 massively against this bet. The unexpected success of this win earned Monolulu eight thousand pounds and national prominence as an eccentric who appeared to know what he was doing. After being unfortunate enough to be in Königsberg during the First Weltkrieg's start and therefore being interned for its duration, Monolulu returned to London in 1919 and has remained ever since.\n\nDespite many seeing the Epsom Derby as a relic of aristocratic rule which conjures the scenes of women in petticoats and oversized hats with their pipe-smoking husbands in ill-fitting suits, it has been transformed into a sport for the common man. Prince Monolulu, a colourful character both from appearance and temperament, has only made the races that much more exciting and remains a fan-favourite to this day."

fractUnionFlav.14.d:0"This year has called for celebration as it marks the 20th anniversary of the Slough Syndicate. Founded by the organiser of the NUWM, Walter Hannington, often simply referred to as 'Wal', the establishment of the Slough Syndicate marked one of the first moments the old nation began its turn towards the more radical forms of socialist governing, eventually leading to the full establishment of the Syndicalist system we now live to defend. With over five thousand workers, the Slough motor transport depot played an important role in the military campaign during the First Weltkrieg; repairing many of the trucks that had been used for ferrying food and munitions to the front, as well as bringing back the corpses of those left to die.\n\nThis importance however, did not spare its workforce from the ever increasing levels of conscription that the population was facing, inevitably leading to the factories closure in 1920 and the liquidation of all its labourers declared to happen two weeks later. This coming deadline resulted in an explosion of pro-socialist activity among the soon-to-be unemployed men, with the ever nearing threat of being sent to the European slaughterhouse lighting a fire for all involved, with Hannington acting as the chief organiser of the resistance. After the governments hearing of this, two checkpoints were established at both exits of the factory to ensure that no worker was found to be taking property, such as tools, equipment and supplies, that did not belong to them from the premises. The workers rightly resented this move and began to resist the searches - organising themselves into marching formations twelve abreast, to march out the factory unharassed. Expectedly, the police that had been deployed to carry out the searches attempted to resist, but found themselves hopelessly outnumbered by the men, marking one of the first turning points of workers organising amongst one another and successfully overcoming the governments jackboot and baton."

Richard John Beattie Seaman, too young to fight in the Weltkrieg, was born right in time to compete in the thrilling automotive sport scene, competing at home and abroad with a passion many would consider spectacular. Starting his career off swiftly by winning three consecutive times in the Swiss Grand Prix, Seaman was, despite his english background, invited to compete on behalf of Mercedes, something that caused great uproar in his family.\n\n Taking the plunge against the wishes of his mother and wider family, Seaman became increasingly isolated despite winning more and more races, becoming a regular in any scene featuring cars in the later thirties. Sadly, last night it was revealed that Seaman, while competing in Spa, Richard the racer suffered a great fatality. Leading the lap during harsh conditions, he crashed into a tree on the twenty second lap, soon catching fire, later dying of his wounds.\n\nCuriously, upon hearing of the death of the master driver, Crown Prince Wilhelm sent a large wreath to his funeral, something that caused great consternation as he was laid to rest in Putney Vale in London. A legendary driver, some still cannot understand why he went to race for the 'other side', and he takes his secret with him to the grave"

uob.55.d:0 "The British ambassador has ignored our demands. While we could just pull out of this whole affair we could also announce to the world how these Syndicalist rowdies cannot be reasoned with - it will make us seem a little childish but will have consequences for them as well.

uob.65.t:0 "Britain Demands a Puppet Government!"
uob.65.d:0 "The British have decided to spread their power and have demanded that we step down and put a puppet government into power. Although Ireland will in theory remain independent many are still against giving in to the Brits."

uob.66.t:0 "Britain Demands Influence and Bases in Ireland!"
uob.66.d:0 "The British government has demanded that we allow them to base their troops in Ireland and have influence in the Irish government, which they will no doubt use to promote socialism.

uob.363.d:0 "It has been decades since we forced the capitalists out, yet we can't rest. Not until they are all defeated will we be safe, but to defeat them the workers spirit will not be enough. There are no two ways about it; without oil our planes, tanks and ships are nothing but scrap, no matter the skill of their crew.\n\nSince we first realised the issue, monumental effort has been spent attempting to cultivate domestic sources of oil. Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures. Fortunately, many saw this coming, and so resources had already been put towards researching synthetic sources of oil. If we divert enough resources in this direction, it may just be possible..."

His name is Alan Turing, a math professor before the revolution, currently living in London. He first tried to evade our men, but after some time, calmed down. And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."

Valois thanked him for the invite, but was unable to make the trip, sending Marcel Bucard as the official representative of the Sorelian wing within the CGT. While many think camarade Valois is more of an intellectual and would rather devote his time to debates at home, some see this choice as yet another example of the tense relationship between the core of Sorel's inheritors and the more active and 'brutish' group around Bucard, whose ideology is closer to that of Benito Mussolini."

Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views.

During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

They went further to state that similar attacks would take place until Wales was given its independence from English rule. The organisation has been in active opposition to the government in Westminster since 1925 and due to a lack of industrialisation in the North of Wales very little has been done to integrate the republican heartlands into the wider Union of Britain.

However, the exact brand of order that has begun to be instated differs greatly, from clique to clique. Quite a few have begun 'reinstating the King's Justice,' bringing back the Law and Order of the old UK, still in exile in Canada, preparing for the King's return to our fair isles. Others, especially those who press closer to Hobart, simply instate military order, with no other goal than keeping the streets safe and the factories running. While all know just how tenuous our position is, this growing difference between our various wings is a bigger threat to our rule than even the Syndicalists who still fight for their dead revolution. With this being the case, Hobart has called for a clandestine meeting of the heads of all cliques who sided with us during the coup, to hammer out our issues. The representatives of the 'Windsorite' cliques have made their case quite simply; there is one legitimate government for these isles, and that is the King, and the King alone. While yes, the King may have been forced to flee Britain, he is still the sole figure who can unite these lands again. The leaders of the 'Non-Aligned' cliques most notable among them being Hobart himself, fiercely disagree with the Windsorites whole heartily, denouncing them as cowards. Not rejecting the concept of a Monarchy, they simply wish to see Britain free, from both Syndicalist tyranny and Windsorite cowardice.

Met with applause from millions of loyalists across the country and with cries of terror from any foolish snakes still hiding out in the grass, Defence Regulation 18B fully grants Mosley to remove any obstacle or opposition in his way in order to achieve the Maximist dream, and all within the confines of the law.

uobflavour.31.d:0 "The Revolutionary Police, much like their prior counterparts, are inefficient when it comes to properly tackling threats. It is due to this factor that Mosley was persuaded by his comrades to provide full immunity and power to the MDF. Although not exactly legal, few are in a position to question Mosley’s actions. The MDF have been given permission to investigate unions suspected of disloyalty, in order to better secure the country for Mosley and to make sure no traitors are in our midst. Whilst on one routine inspection inside union headquarters, an MDF detachment under leadership of Comrade Ted Lewis discovered plans for an organised protest to take place directly in front of Mosley’s planned speech at Cable Street. The documents included a list of notable union leaders and politicians who had associated with the planned protest, though it is curious as to why such an important document would be found so easily. Regardless, these inspections are secretive and unknown to union leaders.\n\nIf such a protest were to take place, it could have drastic consequences on the Maximist’s perceived power and popularity. Many, including Comrade Lewis, have suggested raiding the homes of those detailed on the list. This could be effective in putting down this opposition however, and forcing the police to exercise such a controversial operation along with blatantly going against Mosley’s stated commitment to freedom and democracy could have even worse consequences..."

It is for this reason that under the newly passed Defence Regulation 18B, Mosley authorised a joint MDF-Police operation to arrest those suspected of threatening the peace of the nation. Along with those names on the union’s list for opposition, many who have been suspected of disloyalty without solid evidence too are to be targeted.\n\nPrecisely coordinated raids across London occurred with Police dragging out suspected traitors to the revolution. The media arm of the Maximists, Revolutionary British People’s Broadcasting Company, have already stirred up news reports of a traitorous coup foiled by brave comrades such as Ted Lewis.

Somehow information detailing the dismissed raids had leaked to the public, an already angered populace of union workers and politicians loyal to the formerly Fed/Con controlled TUC were further galvanised by fears that their liberties were at great risk. A united demonstration prepared in the early hours of the morning by constructing makeshift barricades, by midday Mosley had to be escorted in by a convoy of police as the protestors had begun to engage directly with law enforcement. Despite the warnings of the police, Chairman Mosley refused to back down, undeterred he took to climbing on top of his escort van to declare the now rioting crowd of protesters as enemies of the nation. By this point there was no stopping the inevitable chaos.\n\nBiff Boys entered into the fray wielding clubs pushing past police officers and clashing directly with protestors, crowds swarmed each other with nearby buildings being set a torch and windows smashed. Mosley had feared such an escalation of violence would take place, he ordered the military to stand guard, as he witnessed pure mayhem he called for action. Soldiers marched through taking aim at the crowds, scrapping Biff Boys and police officers quickly fled behind the soldiers as a volley of gunfire hit the rioting mob. At once the crowd dispersed allowing the soldiers, police and maximists alike to grab whoever they could.

For this reason Chairman Mosley has decided to rein in the TUC, using his newfound ability to pass legislation allowing for the formation of a National Council. This council will be composed of members elected directly by the people to represent their field of expertise, much like the original goal of the TUC. However these councils will be loyal to the Chairman, they will serve to advise not to broker deals driven for personal gain. All councillors will then personally be approved by Mosley who will accept their democratic victory against their opponents.

Maximism truly is the ideology for the masses for it preaches the importance of the individual as long as they work in the collective.

Also known simply as the 'Lumpen' this portion of the populace, roughly 3-5%, are those who cannot or chose not to work, those who steal to get by, those who panhandle, the poorest of the poor in other words, those whom a more reactionary society would consider not but dirty and lazy degenerates. While the Union of Britain prided itself on its progressive and equal laws, many of those in the TUC and even many simply within the working class, viewed themselves to be greater than the Lumpen. Indeed, in many ways life for the Lumpen is the same under the us and it was under the Reactionaries. Unlike under the reactionaries however, the Lumpen have lost the right to vote. Due to the driving force of the Revolution being Unions, only those workers within Unions legally have the right to vote. With the Lumpen either not having work or not making enough to afford dues, they remain outside a Union, and thus outside the political process. While it is not only the Lumpen who are affected by this, some workers choose to not join a Union, they are the most overwhelmingly affected. Not only this, but due to them not being members in a Union, they are often denied social benefits, although they still have access to much more than they did under the reactionary Windsors. Due to this, and among other factors, many consider the Lumpen to be a breeding ground for reactionary idealism, which does seem to be correct.\n\nThis is where the proposed bill enters the discussion. Due to the growing presence of reactionary elements within the Lumpen, and due to the fact they have been long ignored by the old corrupted TUC, the bill would have a special and due free Union created, especially for the Lumpen. While in reality, the Union would almost function solely as a meeting hall, it would allow a sizeable section of the population to finally have a voice in government. Those who oppose the bill, mostly those outside of the Autonomists, say that by creating such a Union, we would encourage laziness. Why work when you can simply join the Lumpen Union and reap all the benefits of a proper worker? Due to the controversial aspect of the bill, the TUC is almost evenly split. Support or condemnation from the Chairman would surely be enough to break the gridlock, and thus both sides have reached out to the Executive, and Chairman Glais is expected to make an announcement regarding the bill in the coming hours."

In a bid to buy popularity with the masses via easy propaganda and a manipulation of historical nostalgia, and in an attempt to score a cheap win against Royalism, a small clique of fanatical youth MPs, primarily young Mosleyites, have put forth a public claim to know who the true culprit was. They suggest that the man behind the Jack the Ripper case was none other than Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, Queen Victoria's own grandson. Originally posed as a suspect by the French writer and dandy aesthete Philippe Simounet, who himself claims to have gotten the information from the famed physician Thomas E. A.

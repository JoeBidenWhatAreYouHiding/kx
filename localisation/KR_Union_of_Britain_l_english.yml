ENG_militia_idea:0 "Militia-Based Military"
ENG_militia_idea_desc:0 "Unlike our Communard brothers, who relied in particular on the support of General Maurice Gamelin during their Revolution, most of the important officers of the British army opposed our Revolution in 1925, and many followed the tyrant George V into exile in Canada. As a result, most of our current armed forces are made up of militiamen who, despite their courage and determination, have little talent or experience as officers. It will be necessary to structure this disorganized whole in one way or another if we want to ensure the effectiveness of our army against the imperialists who will without a doubt try to put an end to our young Revolution."
ENG_isolation_idea:0 "Splendid Isolation"
ENG_isolation_idea_desc:0 "While the Congregationists are the most vocal about it, all factions of British politics advocate at least some form of British isolationism. This may change over time, but for now it will make foreign involvement very hard."

ENG_ministry_truth_idea_desc:0 "Under the ever-watchful eye of Eric Blair and his Ministry of Intelligence, the Union of Britain is kept safe from counter-revolutionary threats both foreign and domestic. Utilizing state-of-the-art surveillance and telecommunications technologies partially based on the appropriated works of Anglo geniuses like Alan Turing and Robert Watson-Watt in conjunction with agents of espionage and their own secret police, the MoI has become a nationwide panopticon dedicated to Mosley’s Revolution and the Maximist dream, even if that means Blair and his agents must falsify some records, burn a few books, tamper with all media and education in the nation, and anything else along the way."
ENG_cable_street_idea:0 "Memories of Cable Street"
ENG_cable_street_idea_desc:0 "The riots that took place on Cable Street showed the entire nation that not all are loyal to the Chairman, foolish defiance has led more to take up arms against Mosley. These pathetic attempts at rebelling will be crushed however the simple existance of struggle shows weakness in the Union. The memories of what took place at Cable Street now serve as a battle cry for those opposed to Maximism."
ENG_maximist_idea:0 "Maximist Fanaticism"
ENG_maximist_idea_desc:0 "The success of the revolution has forged an unbreakable nationwide devotion to the Chairman, all workers from every corner of Britain must do their duty to provide for the nation.

While to many this comes across as tyrannical, Mosley has been able to attract likeminded individuals to his cause. Regardless, a victory the Maximists would be suprising.§!"

ENG_CON_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Congregationist wing of the TUC                           §gThe Congregationalists are unique offshoot from the orthodox syndicalist movement that had arisen in France and Italy, promoting pacifism and pushing feminist causes as well as the general improvement of the status of women. To many working men this seems like an unnecessary goal and a distraction from the revolution but they appeal to women in a large number. It is unlikely the Congregationalists can take power on their own and they are likely to be propelled into a position through dealings with the larger Federationists§!"

Led by the famed Welsh poet and nationlist Niclas Y Glais, the Autonomists represent the most moderate but also more radical leanings within the TUC.

While noble in its aims, the small party was unable to have much impact in British political scene and saw mass defections both during the initial revolution and especially after with most of its former supporters finding a comfortable home in the Autonomists.

In the aftermath of the revolution, to suit the new realities the Liberals dropped the business friendly approach and fully adopted a progressive world view, gaining it some minor support in the TUC. It continues to be the only legal 'party' in the entire Union though it holds no sway in politics and is considered a non-entity by many. It's old leader David Lloyd George continues as its nominal chairman despite his retirement from politics and in reality he serves as more of a meaningless figurehead and personality rather than actual leader..§!"

The reality was much more stark, while much of the party's natural supporters and top officials escaped to Canada, it continues to linger on, mostly among supporters in the rural areas of the Union.

Some generals and admirals stayed in Britain, refusing to stop fighting even as the Old Order collapsed. Wishing an end to the civil war, and seeing the chance to win a true officer core, a general pardon was offered. Many accepted, and pledged their services to the Union. While their service is desperately needed to makeup for the chronic lack of skilled military leadership among our direct supporters, their loyalty is constantly in question and they have made it implicitly known that they will not tolerate the government to overstep its boundaries, more specifically a Maxmist administration.

Openly opposed to our regime, syndicalism and continued rule from London, these groups and other similar ones are not a cohesive body and so serve as little more than a thuggish nuisance. If things were to explode out of control however, they might just seize their chance to break away once and for all.§!"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"
POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."
POLITICS_TRADE_UNION_CONGRESS_DESC:0 "Until the next year, the Trade Union Congress will have to work without a Chairman."
POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."
POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "To some, Lawrence is a New Cromwell, hellbent on shaping England in his dictatorial image. To others, Lawrence is the protector of British Democracy, and the savoir of the nation. Many things can be said about Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg. However, despite people’s views on him, one thing is a fact: His power over Britain is undeniable. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many now fear that his power may go to his head; and he could end up being no better than the man he deposed. "
POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instill in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."
POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in a rising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."
POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."
POLITICS_JOHN_STRACHEY_DESC:0 "Journalist by trade, Maximist disciple and close friend of Oswald Mosley, John Strachey is a name to be reckoned with and his risen exponentially in the Union of Britain. Coming off the back of Mosley's disgraceful collapse, Strachey has been poised to take the reins and has since taken the Maximists away from the cultist devotion that surrounded his friend and mentor. A self-proclaimed 'liberal Maximist', Strachey aligns closely with the economic organisation and principles of the Maximist state but is less so inclined to its totalitarian and ultra-statist philosophy."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affairs."

### Focuses ###
ENG_status_quo:0 "Status Quo"
ENG_status_quo_desc:0 "The syndicalist order has withstood an onslaught of political challenges, but has held firm. Britain shall keep its course, and continue to boldly and unapologetically champion the cause of the worker and the revolution above all else."
ENG_united_britain:0 "United Britain"
ENG_united_britain_desc:0 "Britain faces great adversity both within and without. While conflict with reactionary nations may prove unavoidable, surely our nation and its people should stand united. Enemies of the revolution must be confronted and eliminated by any means necessary."
ENG_decentralized_command:0 "Decentralised Command"
ENG_decentralized_command_desc:0 "While our armies are decentralised, they still rely on inefficient chains of command to make tactical decisions. Non-commissioned officers and even the humblest of militiamen must be instilled with the spirit of leadership and given the agency to direct their units as they see fit. No man should die waiting for an order to be issued."

ENG_the_common_land:0 "The Common Land"
ENG_the_common_land_desc:0 "While Britain was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, much of our nation remains rural and reliant on agriculture. To facilitate increased crop yields, all lands seized from noble estates during the revolution should be parceled to rural syndicates. Britain's land shall now belong to her people alone!"

ENG_cayley_plan:0 "Cayley's Plan"
ENG_cayley_plan_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Admiral Richard Cayley is at the forefront of a highly vocal group of naval officers who wish to see Britain rapidly expand its submarine fleet and restructure its doctrine with Germany as its model."
ENG_anstice_plan:0 "Anstice's Plan"
ENG_anstice_plan_desc:0 "While many scoff at the notion that aircraft could ever serve as the backbone of a navy, Admiral Edmund Anstice asserts the necessity of controlling the skies over the sea. To do so, Anstice proposes that the role and number of aircraft carriers be greatly expanded."
ENG_dickens_plan:0 "Dickens' Plan"
ENG_dickens_plan_desc:0 "The Royal Navy was centred around the battleship and naval firepower. While Britain lost the Weltkrieg, its Navy held strong throughout the conflict. Since the revolution, naval strategy has advanced rapidly, and to many Republican naval officers, the Union of Britain must make a concerted effort to catch up to its rivals, rather than take a radical new approach to naval warfare."
ENG_merchant_marine:0 "Merchant Marine"
ENG_merchant_marine_desc:0 "The British Merchant Service was on the bleeding edge of civilian shipping administration. During the Weltkrieg, tactics developed by the Service to counter U-Boat raids kept Britain from terrible starvation. If our republic is to have any chance of surviving future conflicts, we must develop a robust Merchant Marine to both regulate shipping and conscript civilian ships for military service when needed."
ENG_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand Dockyards"
ENG_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "With a Merchant Marine service established and all union operated ships firmly integrated, our nation's ports are becoming increasingly congested. With the problem projected to only worsen, we must immediately expand the most clogged ports."
ENG_submarines:0 "Submarine Effort"
ENG_submarines_desc:0 "Per Admiral Cayley's direction, our presently quite small submarine fleet is due for expansion. Our current submarine designs, however, are inadequate. We must develop and deploy more advanced models."
ENG_destroyers:0 "Destroyer Effort"
ENG_destroyers_desc:0 "Our new fleet cannot operate entirely below the waves. To support out U-Boats, we need ships that are both versatile and agile, capable of dealing with those threats are U-Boats are unable to."
ENG_carrier_efforts:0 "Carrier Effort"
ENG_carrier_efforts_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers have taken on a much greater role in naval combat, and Britain must change with the times. Our carrier fleet will be the centrepiece of the renewed British Navy."
ENG_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
ENG_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Traditional aircraft designs are unable to fulfil the unique requirements of naval aviation. We must develop new aircraft designed be operated from carriers and other situations where runway space is at a premium."
ENG_battlecruisers:0 "Fast Battleship Effort"
ENG_battlecruisers_desc:0 "While lacking the armour of a Dreadnought, Fast Battleships are agile and pack a versatile suite of heavy guns. An evolution of the Battlecruisers of WW1 who served effectively during the Weltkrieg, an expansion of our Fast Battleship fleets is essential to the reconstruction of the British Navy."
ENG_battleships:0 "Dreadnought Effort"
ENG_battleships_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts are the kings of the sea, and were key to the global dominance of the British Royal Navy at the prior to the Weltkrieg. If we are to ever regain our naval strength, we must have new battleships."
ENG_republican_marines:0 "Republican Marines"
ENG_republican_marines_desc:0 "While naval power and the projection thereof are critical to military success, ships alone are unable to invade islands or assault coasts. Few Marine officers sided with the revolution in 1925, and as a result, the Republic's ability to conduct amphibious operations was stunted. If we are to having any hope of confronting our enemies across the seas, we must have a Marine department."
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty:0 "Revolutionary Admiralty"
ENG_revolutionary_admiralty_desc:0 "The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs was the body responsible for the administration of the Royal Navy and served as a forum for communication between officers. The Republican Navy currently lacks any comparable office, with Naval affairs often tied-up in politics. Thus, we must establish an independent and thoroughly socialist Admiralty."
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves:0 "Britannia Rules the Waves"
ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves_desc:0 "At last, the British Navy is beginning to look like its former self. If not already, soon enough, Britain will again rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!"

ENG_republican_air_force:0 "Republican Air Force"
ENG_republican_air_force_desc:0 "Air power is critical for success on the modern battlefield. Currently, our air service is subordinate to our army, and while that assures democratisation, an independent Air Force would certainly be more effective. Thus, we must establish an Air Force both independent and socialist in character."
ENG_new_pilot_training:0 "New Pilot Training"
ENG_new_pilot_training_desc:0 "Pilot training in many nations, including our own, has been largely non-standard, and reliant on enthusiasts turned instructors. By consulting with prominent pilots, we can develop an effective training regimen."
ENG_flying_women:0 "Women's Flying Corps"
ENG_flying_women_desc:0 "Capable pilots are always in short supply, and the women of our nation, whose support was so crucial to the success of the revolution, yearn for the freedom of the skies. While it will certainly prove controversial, we have drafted a plan to create allow women to serve in the RAF in support roles to free up more men for combat."
ENG_aviation_unions:0 "Aviation Unions"
ENG_aviation_unions_desc:0 "Many syndicates around Britain operate small aerodromes for a variety of purposes. The larger of these facilities should be given state funding for expansion."
ENG_aviation_fuel_administration:0 "Aviation Fuel Administration"
ENG_aviation_fuel_administration_desc:0 "Without fuel, it does not matter how skilled our pilots are. It is likely that when war comes our fuel imports will be cut-off so we must work towards domestics sources of fuel; for the safety of the revolution we mustn't be depended on capitalist suppliers of oil. They can't be trusted."
ENG_air_observer_corps:0 "Air Observer Corps"
ENG_air_observer_corps_desc:0 "While London was terrorised throughout the Weltkrieg by German airships, relatively little damage was done by these raids. Since then however, the range and payload of aircraft has increased greatly. To counter the threat, we should create a volunteer organisation which looks vigilantly for enemy planes to forewarn our interceptor and anti-aircraft teams."
ENG_expand_air_unions:0 "Expand Air Unions"
ENG_expand_air_unions_desc:0 "Our programme of aerodrome enlargement was of great benefit to the expansion of the Republican Air Force, but proved to be a substantial administrative burden. With the air force now well-established, the Air Union programme can be expanded."

ENG_international:0 "Britain Within the International"
ENG_international_desc:0 "Britain's political factions advocate quite different foreign policy approaches. With the turbulent 1936 special session of the TUC at an end, Britain's place in the world, and especially its relationship with its socialist comrades of the Third Internationale, must be reassessed."
ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation:0 "Norwegian Comrades"
ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation_desc:0 "A more equitable Norway has arisen, and we will stand arm in arm with our socialist brethren there. The Norwegian and British people have much to offer each other, and as a gesture of our goodwill, we shall offer Norway generous economic assistance in exchange simply for future cooperation."
ENG_anglo_irish_friendship:0 "Anglo-Irish Friendship"
ENG_anglo_irish_friendship_desc:0 "With the light of socialism at last shining upon the Emerald Isle, the time for reconciliation between our historically closely linked peoples has come. Not only should we send diplomats and politicians to Dublin, but also representatives of the most successful British syndicates to help Ireland along the path of progress."
ENG_class_warfare:0 "Class Warfare"
ENG_class_warfare_desc:0 "War is upon us, and to preserve our great nation and secure our liberty, all working men must now unite for victory. We should promote the spirit of unity, self-sacrifice, and most of all, renewed class consciousness, to augment our war effort."
ENG_never_surrender:0 "We Shall Never Surrender"
ENG_never_surrender_desc:0 "As with any war effort, there are many detractors who advocate reconciliation with the enemy. To counter this sentiment, we should begin a propaganda campaign to promote the just nature of our war and the necessity of victory."
ENG_bletchley_park:0 "Bletchley Park"
ENG_bletchley_park_desc:0 "In the north of Buckinghamshire, a crack team of military intelligence researchers has emerged. Despite minimal funding, the Bletchley Park Electrician's Union, in coordination with our foreign intelligence service, has produced singular results. We should expand Bletchley Park's facilities and provide them with substantial state funding."
ENG_support_comrades:0 "Support Foreign Comrades"
ENG_support_comrades_desc:0 "If socialism is to survive, all socialist nations must thrive. It is our duty as socialists to assist the formerly downtrodden peoples around the globe who now valiantly their oppressors."
ENG_american_comrades:0 "American Comrades"
ENG_american_comrades_desc:0 "From America's manufacturing belt has come forth a redoubt of socialism. This new bastion of liberation, however, could easily be destroyed by the reactionaries it defies. We must assist the courageous workers of America any way that we can."
ENG_mexican_comrades:0 "Mexican Comrades"
ENG_mexican_comrades_desc:0 "The people of Mexico were among the first to cast off the chains of capitalist exploitation. Mexico remains, however, quite underdeveloped. We possess the means to help the Mexicans better their lot, and such assistance would surely foster closer ties between our nations."
ENG_further_cooperation:0 "Further Cooperation"
ENG_further_cooperation_desc:0 "We must do even more assist our North American allies. The relationship we are building there will surely be the start of something far greater."
ENG_mission_to_australasia:0 "Mission to Australasia"

ENG_australasian_comrades:0 "Australasian Comrades"
ENG_australasian_comrades_desc:0 "Now that socialism down-under has stabilised, we much give them what support we can to avoid them slipping back into their old ways."
ENG_indian_comrades:0 "Indian Comrades"
ENG_indian_comrades_desc:0 "Britain was once the oppressor of the Indian people. However, the strength of the relationship between our two peoples, regardless of the unfortunate circumstance in which it was built, is undeniable. Through economic assistance to Bharatiya Commune, we can begin to put right the injustices of history, and in the process, strengthen the socialist cause."
ENG_liberation_of_canada:0 "Liberation of Canada"
ENG_liberation_of_canada_desc:0 "Across the Atlantic Ocean in the frigid north, the devil himself seemingly lies in wait. Canada and its lackeys will surely strike us with even the smallest opportunity. We cannot wait to be attacked; we are as ready now to liberate the people of Canada as we ever will be."


ENG_tuc:0 "The 1936 Congress of the Trade Unions"
ENG_tuc_desc:0 "This year's TUC will probably be a bit special - long-time Chairman Philip Snowden has indicated that he intends to resign. The decentralisationist Autonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralisationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley) and status quo Federationists (Arthur Horner) with his egalitarian & pacifist running mate Annie Kenney are all vying for superiority. These will be nights to remember..."
ENG_tuc_economy:0 "Economic Policy"
ENG_tuc_economy_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
ENG_tuc_internal:0 "Internal Policy"
ENG_tuc_internal_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
ENG_tuc_military:0 "Military Affairs"
ENG_tuc_military_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
ENG_tuc_foreign:0 "Foreign Policy"
ENG_tuc_foreign_desc:0 "We must now consider the debate in the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The congress listened casually to every candidate until the suggestion of the Autonomists were heard, when a slow, shocked murmur ran through the hall."
ENG_central_industry_research:0 "Central Industry Research"
ENG_central_industry_research_desc:0 "To prepare our Syndicalist industry for the fight against the Capitalists, we should establish the Department for Central Industry Research. This office will help us overcome inefficiency."
ENG_local_help:0 "Local Help Initiative"
ENG_local_help_desc:0 "Many Comrades in the Union of Britain are still living in great poverty. The bureaucracy has done little to help them. If we extended our support of the local councils, these suffering people would finally feel the blessings of the revolution."
ENG_expand_industry_1:0 "Expand Industry: Wales and the Midlands"
ENG_expand_industry_1_desc:0 "The capitalist regime of old neglected Wales and the Midlands for centuries, and allowed, if not outright encouraged, the gradual depopulation of the region as its labourers migrated to England's southern cities for menial jobs. The great economic potential of these regions and its people thus remains largely untapped; for the benefit of all, we must invest!"
ENG_militarized_industry:0 "Militarised Industry"

ENG_expand_industry_2:0 "Expand Industry: Scotland"

ENG_local_industry:0 "Local Industry Initiative"
ENG_local_industry_desc:0 "The Syndicalist economy does not only consist of steel factories but also of small non-centralised manufactures. By supporting these independent Syndicates, we will ensure versatile and flexible production."
ENG_local_talent:0 "Local Talent Initiative"
ENG_local_talent_desc:0 "We cannot afford to waste innovative talent just because it is not centred in the metropolitan areas. We need to support local talent."
ENG_local_initiative:0 "Expand Local Initiative"
ENG_local_initiative_desc:0 "While we have granted much power to the local communes, they continue to deal primarily with the central government. We should make reaching the central government harder so that our workers will work with each other for true socialist progress."
ENG_political_commissars:0 "Maximist Defence Force" 
ENG_political_commissars_desc:0 "The Union of Britain is a nation of freedom and liberty, the revolution has broken the chains holding workers back from expressing their beliefs. Despite this we must not allow ideologues to push anti-revolutionary rhetoric, the task of the Defence Force is to defend the revolution!"
ENG_defend_the_revolution:0 "Federationists: Defend the Revolution"
ENG_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Revolution must be defended from the attacks from Autonomists and Maximists! The only way forward is the orthodox one!"
ENG_new_capital:0 "Move the TUC"
ENG_new_capital_desc:0 "London has long held a privileged place in Britain, and has become swamped by Centralism and bureaucracy; the TUC's current location reinforces this. Only by moving to a smaller city, one at the heart of Britain, and thus within reach of all its people, will we able to guarantee fair representation for all. This city will be Birmingham."
ENG_home_rule:0 "Home Rule"
ENG_home_rule_desc:0 "Syndicalism has to be achieved locally. Some offices, like tax enforcers - nobody likes those people anyway - can be moved to the home nation capitals of Cardiff and Edinburgh. They can prepare the establishment of local TUCs."
ENG_dissolve_tuc:0 "Dissolve the TUC"
ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union Congress has served its purpose. While it once represented the Syndicalist dream of true proletarian government, it now symbolises Centralist repression to many. With the success of our initial decentralisation efforts, the time has come to make the People's Palace the seat of a new, English TUC. The remains of the Union will be dealt with shortly."
ENG_devolution:0 "Devolution"

ENG_turn_the_other_cheek:0 "Compromise with Maximists"

ENG_reform_militia:0 "Reform the Militias"
ENG_reform_militia_desc:0 "The Worker's Militias have been reformed into something a little more usable while the old democratic structures have been preserved. They still somewhat hinder military efficiency - but that we are able to tolerate. Break the Chains!"
ENG_dissolve_militias:0 "Dissolve the Militias"
ENG_dissolve_militias_desc:0 "The arms in the hands of the rabble have been tolerated for too long now. While our enemies hold on to these remains of a bygone age for some reason we know that only discipline is the way forward."
ENG_purge_militia_remains:0 "Adopt New Doctrines"

ENG_revolution:0 "Revolution"
ENG_revolution_desc:0 "This whole 'reforming the country' business has turned out to be very boring. We can attempt one swift strike to totally seize the means of politics and make our political programme a reality. This will be risky, though."
ENG_central_command:0 "Central Command"
ENG_central_command_desc:0 "We need to establish a central Army Headquarters to optimise communication and cooperation between army units. This will allow for more grand-scale operations to be planned in an efficient manner."
ENG_improve_army:0 "A New Lee Enfield?"
ENG_improve_army_desc:0 "The rifles supplied by the factories formerly owned by Lee Enfield still constitute the overwhelming majority of our infantry weapons. However, at least according to gun connoisseurs, the weapons produced by the Birmingham Small Arms Factory have the reputation of being more suitable for offensive manoeuvres and change might be in order."

ENG_raf:0 "The Doctrine Dispute"

ENG_three_armies:0 "Three Armies"
ENG_three_armies_desc:0 "Now that the home countries have at least partly gained their autonomy that same autonomy should go to the Worker's Militias.

ENG_big_boat_research_desc:0 "The Republican Navy has put a lot of effort and resources into the RNS Rebecca - but it's really not the right path.

By working closely with prominent suffragettes and other advocates for wider rights for all Anglo citizens - regardless of lifestyle, and regardless of if whether they share our Maximist sensibilities like figures like Mary Richardson, Victor Barker, and Mary Sophia Allen do, or even if they don't, like in the case of valuable state intelligence asset and apolitical homosexual Alan Turing and others like him who prefer to keep their sexuality and wider life out of the political lens - we shall all work together as total equals under Maximism in order to ensure that every dedicated and proud Brit in the nation plays their role in Mosley’s Revolution without question, obstacle, or hesitation."

uob.0.d:0 "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany dragged on inconclusively for two years. In 1921, the stalemate was finally broken when Lloyd-George agreed to the German proposal of a "Peace with Honour". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, content to build socialism in isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."

However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters.

uob.25.d:0 "The socialist navy has left its naval base in Liverpool and is heading towards Iceland and the Azores. Although this move seems to be just a show of force it should not be ignored. This is not a direct threat towards the Entente but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice. A most appropriate answer would be to send out the Royal Navy but this is opposed by many Canadians who prefer further preparations before decisive action against the Union is taken."

Some argue that Ireland should be annexed into the Union of Britain, while others argue that this would be an act of unsocialist imperialism and that doing so would not be supported by the Irish people, bringing us into a bloody guerrilla war."
uob.84.a:0 "Of course Ireland shall be independent!"

uob.97.d:0 "Today, the military operation codenamed 'Demetrius' began, with our armies occupying many areas of Ireland and interning IRA partisans despite large rebel and civilian resistance. However outside of Leinster where our forces and administration are centralised Irish resistance could potentially be enough to overpower our armies..."
uob.97.a:0 "Irish rebels outside of Leinster start an uprising!"

uob.98.t:0 "Fall of the Irish Resistance"
uob.98.d:0 "With the crushing of the Irish uprising the Irish resistance has for now been broken for now, although the Irish still resent us and remember the Irish Republic and will no doubt resist us once again in the future."
uob.98.a:0 "It's over for now..."

uob.99.t:0 "Operation Demetrius"
uob.99.d:0 "Today, the military operation codenamed 'Demetrius' began, with our armies occupying many areas of Ireland and interning IRA partisans despite large rebel and civilian resistance.

uob.101.d:0 "Now that the a new Chairman has finally been chosen many are urging to quickly choose a new General Secretary and end the period of uncertainty in British politics."
uob.101.aa:0 "The Congregationists are our closest allies."
uob.101.ab:0 "A compromise with the Maximists is in order."

uob.101.ah:0 "I have total confidence in the abilities of Tom Mann."

uob.103.t:0 "Merge the Posts of Chairman & General Secretary"
uob.103.d:0 "We can merge the positions of Chairman and General Secretary. While this is very much unconstitutional it will also very much strengthen our own position."
uob.103.a:0 "A strong leader for the Union!"
uob.103.b:0 "This doesn't seem like a good idea..."

uob.106.t:0 "The Exchequer's Post"
uob.106.d:0 "With Mosley securing his power in the TUC, he has to make up his mind about the Exchequer's office. His retaining his post would create a concentration of power that is not only prohibited by the Union's constitution but may also affect the quality of Maximist rule. The only problem is choosing a suitable candidate."
uob.106.aa:0 "Abe Moffat, director of the Coventry Machine Plants."
uob.106.ab:0 "David Kirkwood, former militia commander."
uob.106.ac:0 "Nye Bevan, creator of the Union's Health Service."
uob.106.ad:0 "Mosley has proven his efficiency and shall remain despite the constitution!"

uob.108.t:0 "A New Lee Enfield?"
uob.108.d:0 "The rifles supplied by the factories formerly owned by Lee Enfield still constitute the overwhelming majority of our infantry weapons. However, at least according to gun connoisseurs, the weapons produced by the Birmingham Small Arms Factory have the reputation of being more suitable for offensive manoeuvres and change might be in order. A third option would be to not prefer one of the both and keep the Republican Army flexible instead."
uob.108.a:0 "Another trusty Enfield."
uob.108.b:0 "Give Birmingham a chance!"
uob.108.c:0 "Stay flexible!"

uob.109.t:0 "A New 1066"
uob.109.d:0 "Enemies of Syndicalism have gained a foothold on our island! The nation will fully mobilise all reserves to rid itself of this disease!"
uob.109.a:0 "To arms, comrades!"

### 201 - 300 Events ###
uob.201.t:0 "Revolution!"
uob.201.d:0 "It is time to decide who we are! Is this simply a game for a rich young boy to play? The colours of the world are changing day by day and today we Maximists have the opportunity to do our part! We will have to decide how we want to form this country after our ideas!"
uob.201.a:0 "Go the 'legal' way."
uob.201.b:0 "Arrest our enemies!"

uob.205.t:0 "TUC Debate Stalled"
uob.205.d:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions has stalled in a fruitless debate over a proposed Maximist law. Comrade Blair has proposed to hold a speech in a few days - while he is known as a gifted public speaker he is not an orthodox Maximist and might smuggle in some of his own points..."
uob.205.a:0 "Comrade Blair was always a good speaker..."
uob.205.b:0 "Comrade Mosley takes the speaker's desk!"

uob.206.t:0 "'Law for Enabling of Control' Blocked"
uob.206.d:0 "Today, the Congress of Trade Unions has shot down the 'Law for the Enabling of Control' bill and also handed in a letter with a sharp protest against our 'authoritarian' government."

uob.208.t:0 "Opposition Leaders Resist Capture"
uob.208.d:0 "Today Maximist-led army units broke into private homes all over the Union and arrested some of the most prominent and outspoken enemies of our ideology. Some, however, have resisted arrest and still are resisting..."

uob.208.b:0 "Convince them to give up..."

uob.209.t:0 "Opposition leaders Elude Capture"
uob.209.d:0 "Today Maximist-led army units broke into private homes all over the Union. Instead of the opposition leaders they hoped to arrest, however, they found only empty houses. Our enemies had been warned."
uob.209.a:0 "Damn counter-revolutionaries!"

uob.210.t:0 "Maximists Assume Control"
uob.210.d:0 "Today, we have worked closely together with loyal Army elements to take control of all important locations throughout the Union. Resistance is non-existent; We have won."

uob.211.t:0 "Resistance Against Maximist Coup"
uob.211.d:0 "Today we have worked closely together with loyal Army elements to take control of all important locations throughout the Union. However, on many streets and courtyards we have encountered open and armed resistance. If we don't act soon this resistance could organise itself."
uob.211.a:0 "Fire!"
uob.211.b:0 "Hope they lay down their arms..."


uob.213.t:0 "The Morning Afterwards"

uob.213.a:0 "Hail Mosley!"

uob.214.t:0 "The Morning Afterwards"
uob.214.d:0 "As the sun rises on the Union of Britain it rises over a shocked country. The events of yesterday have shown that the Syndicalist order may not be as set in stone as it seems..."
uob.214.a:0 "Who knows what the future holds?"

uob.215.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.215.d:0 "Yesterday the British Congress of Trade Union has passed the 'Enabling Control Bill', passing quasi-dictatorial powers over to the government of Oswald Mosley. The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

uob.215.b:0 "Horrible!"

uob.216.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.216.d:0 "Yesterday the British Congress of Trade Union has passed the 'Enabling Control Bill', passing quasi-dictatorial powers over to the government of Oswald Mosley. After a rousing speech by Eric Blair, promising that the necessary restrictions in personal rights shall only remain until the second they are not necessary any more, the Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."
uob.216.a:0 "Wonderful!"
uob.216.b:0 "Horrible!"

uob.217.t:0 "Maximist Revolution Averted"
uob.217.d:0 "Yesterday the British Congress of Trade Union has shot down the 'Enabling Control Bill', afterwards signing a letter of protest against the government led by Oswald Mosley. This is a clear sign of resistance against the Maximist government and will lead to an unknown future."

uob.217.b:0 "Wonderful!"

uob.218.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.218.d:0 "Yesterday British Republican Army units arrested many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley. The few opposition representatives still left in the Congress of Trade Unions are too intimidated to protest. The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."
uob.218.a:0 "Wonderful!"
uob.218.b:0 "Horrible!"

uob.219.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.219.d:0 "Yesterday British Republican Army units arrested many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley. However, The few opposition representatives still left in the Congress of Trade Unions condemned this illegitimate behaviour following unconfirmed reports of some of their comrades having been shot after actively resisting arrest. The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."
uob.219.a:0 "Wonderful!"
uob.219.b:0 "Horrible!"

uob.220.t:0 "Maximist Revolution Averted"
uob.220.d:0 "Yesterday British Republican Army units tried to arrest many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley. However, many had left their homes and gone undercover after having been tipped off by sources inside the armed forces. There are also as-of-yet unconfirmed reports of many of them openly marching into the assembly hall of the Trade Union Congress under the massive cheers of anti-Mosley demonstrators, only leaving after being handcuffed at the speakers table to the "boos" of the assembly. This day will leave a clear mark on Maximist prestige."
uob.220.a:0 "Horrible!"
uob.220.b:0 "Wonderful!"

uob.221.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.221.d:0 "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman.

uob.221.b:0 "Horrible!"

uob.222.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.222.d:0 "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman. This threat then became obvious as the military forces came under fire from private homes leading to prolonged battles all over the island. The number of casualties is as-of-yet unknown, but the Maximists pass emergency law after emergency law in order to contain the situation; The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."
uob.222.a:0 "Wonderful!"
uob.222.b:0 "Horrible!"

uob.223.t:0 "Military Coup D'etat in the Union of Britain"
uob.223.d:0 "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman. However, after some confusion, the army finally turned on the Maximist government representatives accompanying them in the late afternoon proclaiming that control will for now be in the hands of Interim Chairman Arthur Horner."
uob.223.a:0 "What?"
uob.223.b:0 "Unexpected, but not unwelcome!"

uob.224.t:0 "Maximist Putsch!"
uob.224.d:0 "This morning the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat. Accompanying them were Maximist officials. This is obviously an attempt by the Maximists to seize power - We must take action now or risk losing control over the country!"
uob.224.a:0 "Proclaim a General Strike!"
uob.224.b:0 "The common soldier will save the Union!"

uob.225.t:0 "General Strike is Successful"
uob.225.d:0 "After we called for a nation-wide General Strike to resist the unlawful coup the streets of the Union soon filled with workers carrying banners and singing syndicalist songs peacefully protesting for Syndicalism. The soldiers, seeing the massive and coordinated resistance against them, soon laid down their arms."
uob.225.a:0 "The Union is saved!"

uob.226.t:0 "General Strike Continues"
uob.226.d:0 "The workers are following our call for protest. The soldiers proceed to seize important buildings - but they seem increasingly insecure. If we proclaim that we will not punish today's traitors they may be willing to give up."
uob.226.a:0 "An amnesty should convince them..."
uob.226.b:0 "No! Traitors must be punished!"

uob.227.t:0 "General Strike Ends in Bloodshed"
uob.227.d:0 "After we called for a nation-wide General Strike to resist the unlawful coup the streets of the Union soon filled with workers carrying banners and singing syndicalist songs peacefully protesting for Syndicalism. The soldiers did not give in and finally a brawl in Manchester seemingly convinced the coup leaders to authorise deadly force. After a hail of machine gun fire only bodies are left on the British streets."
uob.227.a:0 "The dead are uncounted..."

uob.228.t:0 "Republican Forces Stand Down"
uob.228.d:0 "After we called for our soldiers to protect the Syndicalist order and not obey the orders of their officers many soon remembered the traditions of the old, disbanded, worker's militias. They formed Soldier Councils and decided to stand down. The scare is over."
uob.228.a:0 "The Union is saved!"

uob.229.t:0 "Republican Forces Stand Idle"
uob.229.d:0 "The soldiers sitting on their tanks and guarding public squares seem to be not doing anything. For whatever reason, the hours pass, and nothing happens. The people peering out of their windows are waiting..."
uob.229.a:0 "Get out the rotten fruit!"
uob.229.b:0 "Let's wait this out..."

uob.230.t:0 "Republican Forces Side With the Maximists"
uob.230.d:0 "Our call to the common soldier has gone unanswered. After some uncertainty the putsching soldiers are now systematically rounding up members of our government. They have taken control of the telephone lines and we have lost our means of communication to the rest of the Union."
uob.230.a:0 "We have failed."

uob.231.t:0 "Mending the Wounds"
uob.231.d:0 "The coup has been averted peacefully, but it should never have happened in the first place. In the aftermath, the people have been left wondering what could make them turn against their own countrymen. The general spirit among the populace, however, is one of reconciliation, as we once again stand together as a true Union of Britain."
uob.231.a:0 "We must forgive, but not forget."

uob.232.t:0 "A New Course for the Union"
uob.232.d:0 "The coup was successful, but has left some serious rifts in our national identity. It will take time to convince the people of our new way for Britain."
uob.232.a:0 "In time, they will realise that we are right."

uob.233.t:0 "Maximist Coup!"
uob.233.d:0 "This evening some army elements occupied the Tower Bridge and several strategic squares all around London. Accompanying them were Maximist officials. This is obviously an attempt by the Maximists to seize power - We must take action now or risk losing control over the country!"
uob.233.a:0 "Proclaim a General Strike!"
uob.233.b:0 "Let the loyal army elements restore order..."

uob.234.t:0 "General Strike is Successful"
uob.234.d:0 "After we called for a nation-wide General Strike to resist the unlawful coup the streets of the Union soon filled with workers carrying banners and singing syndicalist songs peacefully protesting for Syndicalism.

uob.237.d:0 "After we called for our soldiers to protect the Syndicalist order and not obey the orders of their officers many soon remembered the traditions of the old, disbanded, worker's militias. They formed Soldier Councils and decided to stand down. The scare is over."

uob.238.t:0 "General Strike is ongoing"

### Needs more Peace in our Time ###
uob.338.t:0 "The Silence after the Storm"
uob.338.d:0 "The battlefields have fallen silent. But while our soldiers enjoy their well-earned rest, worried representatives of Industrial Syndicates have come forward, with statistics showing the large degree to which the Union's industry has been restructured to aid the war effort. For now, our economy is still somewhat stable - but the upcoming years will not be easy ones."
uob.338.a:0 "When will we finally get a break?"

### 350 - 400: Another Congress of the Trade Unions Events ###
uob.350.t:0 "An Extraordinary Congress of the Trade Unions?"

uob.350.a:0 "Now is the perfect time to reorganise the government!"
uob.350.b:0 "The current government is doing a splendid job..."

uob.351.t:0 "The State of the Economy"
uob.351.d:0 "Our economy was enlarged in the time leading up to the war. The extraordinary congress now has to face the decision of either pushing for further expansion or prioritising the healing of the wounds inflicted by the war."
uob.351.a:0 "Onwards, British industry! Build, build, build!"
uob.351.b:0 "We must aid our deprived citizens!"

uob.355.c:0 "The current Commissary is doing a fine job."

uob.356.t:0 "A Change in Leadership?"
uob.356.d:0 "Comrade Mosley saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far. Maximism has led us well through this war and is still popular - but the people are growing tired of authoritarianism, and elements in the Maximists and the Congregationalists are seeking to propose a new liberal way forward."
uob.356.a:0 "Time for reform, John Strachey breaks the Mosleyite cult!"
uob.356.b:0 "Eric Blair shall establish true Charterite Totalism!"

uob.357.t:0 "A Change in Leadership?"
uob.357.d:0 "Our inimitable chairwoman has shown mettle like that of Elizabeth I as she led us reluctantly through this war. Today, however, she looks tired and unlikely to win re-election. Perhaps she can, though, if she looks to more unconventional allies..."
uob.357.a:0 "The Maximist Mosley and his protege Jack Jones win the top jobs."
uob.357.b:0 "She turns to Radical Socialist Clem Attlee for support!"
uob.357.c:0 "Perhaps a bit more of a feminine touch..."

uob.358.t:0 "A Change in Leadership?"
uob.358.d:0 "It has been quite some time since Chairman Glais oversaw the de-federalisation of our Union and the autonomy of Wales and Scotland and the succession of English chairmanship in favour of Fenner Brockway. Now, in the aftermath of the European war, we must decide whether Brockway deserves to keep the job."
uob.358.a:0 "The Maximist Mosley and his protege Jack Jones win the top jobs."
uob.358.b:0 "Gallacher and Priestley will speak for England and Scotland!"
uob.358.c:0 "Brockway asks Y Glais to appeal to Bevan's Welsh background!"

uob.359.t:0 "A Change in Leadership?"
uob.359.d:0 "The Chairman has saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far. Federationism has led us well through this war and is still popular - but Oswald Mosley is challenging him for the Chair, as is the up-and-coming Congregationalist Barbara Castle. Federationists may have to rely on an old ally to win the day..."
uob.359.a:0 "The Chairman elevates G.D.H. Cole to General Secretary."
uob.359.b:0 "An Attlee-Cole Alliance will win the day!"
uob.359.c:0 "Mosley and Blair win the Chair and General Secretariat!"
uob.359.e:0 "Barbara Castle and James Maxton make a pact!"

uob.360.t:0 "Terminate Home Rule?"
uob.360.d:0 "Now that the Maximists rule over the Union of Britain, they should realise their promise of limiting Home Rule once again. But while this promise has quite the following in the halls of London and other English cities, protests and demonstrations have been staged by our enemies already - and they will only grow stronger if we follow through..."
uob.360.a:0 "It shall be done!"
uob.360.b:0 "Maybe this wasn't the best idea..."

uob.361.t:0 "A Cold, Wet Day for Eric Blair"
uob.361.d:0 "Comrade Eric Blair, once an ally of Grand Protector Mosley, cannot stand it any longer. For too long the evil Mosley had perverted the constitution and made the Union of Britain his plaything. A popular writer and skilled militia commander, Blair alone has the authority to bring down the tyrant. As Blair stared out into the rain today, he knew he had to take action."
uob.361.a:0 "His Populist coup is successful!"
uob.361.b:0 "He brings in the military!"
uob.361.c:0 "Mosley sniffs out the coup!"

uob.362.t:0 "A Cold, Wet Day"
uob.362.d:0 "Early this morning, the popular writer and skilled militia commander Eric Blair was found dead in his home after obviously having committed suicide. While officially no testament has been found, it is an open secret that Blair was no longer an ally of Grand Protector Mosley.\n\nAs the 'improvised' demonstration in his honour slowly and quietly travelled through the streets of London, ever more people joined, many with tears in their eyes. Some wept for the man, some for the last hope against Mosley's dictatorship."
uob.362.a:0 "Finally he's gone..."

uob.363.t:0 "The Oil Question"
uob.363.d:0 "It has been decades since we forced the capitalists out, yet we can't rest. Not until they are all defeated will we be safe, but to defeat them the workers spirit will not be enough. There are no two ways about it; without oil our planes, tanks and ships are nothing but scrap, no matter the skill of their crew.\n\nSince we first realised the issue, monumental effort has been spent attempting to cultivate domestic sources of oil. Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures. Fortunately, many saw this coming, and so resources had already been put towards researching synthetic sources of oil. If we divert enough resources in this direction, it may just be possible..."
uob.363.a:0 "It will have to be enough..."

uob.364.t:0 "Support from the Union of Britain"
uob.364.d:0 "Today an envoy from the Union of Britain arrived. He brought with him promises of industrial assistance, naval advice and technological support, along with kind words of admiration for our struggle. The capitalists may be strong and fighting us at every turn, but with allies such as these, we will best them regardless."
uob.364.a:0 "Truly workers solidarity is shining out from the British isles."

### Flavour Events ###
uobflavour.1.t:0 "A Riddle"
uobflavour.1.d:0 "Our Railway Syndicates have a tradition of giving out ridiculously difficult crossword puzzles in their newspapers. Only a few people manage to actually solve these puzzles. Now, however, the Mid-England Rail Syndicate has reported that for the past few months, anonymous letters have started arriving, always containing the correct solutions to the last crossword puzzle. Whoever is writing these letters must be some sort of genius - and could probably be of help to us..."
uobflavour.1.a:0 "Find that person!"
uobflavour.1.b:0 "What do I care?"

uobflavour.2.t:0 "Wrapped in a Mystery"

In the post this morning the Daily Worker received correspondence from the dissident Welsh republican organisation ‘Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru’ or The Wales Home Rule Army claiming responsibility for the attack. They went further to state that similar attacks would take place until Wales was given its independence from English rule. The organisation has been in active opposition to the government in Westminster since 1925 and due to a lack of industrialisation in the North of Wales very little has been done to integrate the republican heartlands into the wider Union of Britain. Only time will tell if more attacks are to come. While the Federationists and Maximists have been quick to condemn the arsonists, Y Glais and the Autononomists have called for a softer hand in catching the arsonists."

While the arson attack in Wales was a bloody nose to the Federationist authority, this has been a direct challenge and panic is spreading now that the fringe and obscure Homeland Watch organization has managed to gain arms likely to be used in future terrorist attacks.

All communications to Wales have been cutoff and allegations that loyal military units there are being murdered in the night by the WHRA remain unsubstantiated. In Scotland the news is much more bleak and it seems the Homeland Watch have assumed full control of the nation from within the shadows with Maximist sympathizers being gunned down in the streets.

In that short time since the coup, the brave men and women of the armed forces have begun restoring a semblance of order, although the new regime is still far from secure. However, the exact brand of order that has begun to be instated differs greatly, from clique to clique. Quite a few have begun 'reinstating the King's Justice,' bringing back the Law and Order of the old UK, still in exile in Canada, preparing for the King's return to our fair isles. Others, especially those who press closer to Hobart, simply instate military order, with no other goal than keeping the streets safe and the factories running.  While all know just how tenuous our position is, this growing difference between our various wings is a bigger threat to our rule than even the Syndicalists who still fight for their dead revolution. With this being the case, Hobart has called for a clandestine meeting of the heads of all cliques who sided with us during the coup, to hammer out our issues. The representatives of the 'Windsorite' cliques have made their case quite simply; there is one legitimate government for these isles, and that is the King, and the King alone. While yes, the King may have been forced to flee Britain, he is still the sole figure who can unite these lands again. The leaders of the 'Non-Aligned' cliques most notable among them being Hobart himself, fierily disagree with the Windsorites whole heartily, denouncing them as cowards. Not rejecting the concept of a Monarchy, they simply wish to see Britain free, from both Syndicalist tyranny and Windsorite cowardice.

The MDF have been given permission to investigate unions suspected of disloyalty, in order to better secure the country for Mosley and to make sure no traitors are in our midst. Whilst on one routine inspection inside union headquarters, an MDF detachment under leadership of Comrade Ted Lewis discovered plans for an organised protest to take place directly in front of Mosley’s planned speech at Cable Street. The documents included a list of notable union leaders and politicians who had associated with the planned protest, though it is curious as to why such an important document would be found so easily. Regardless, these inspections are secretive and unknown to union leaders.\n\n If such a protest were to take place, it could have drastic consequences on the Maximist’s perceived power and popularity. Many, including Comrade Lewis, have suggested raiding the homes of those detailed on the list.

uobflavour.32.d:0 "After some time pondering the consequences of the existence of a unified political opposition, Chairman Mosley came to the conclusion that the potential instability and chaos caused by open disrespect of power is a threat greater than any commitment to freedom. After all, are people not at their most free when they are serving the state? The freedom to serve a purpose, to be proud of one’s nation and its achievements, that is the freedom Mosley provides. It is for this reason that under the newly passed Defence Regulation 18B, Mosley authorised a joint MDF-Police operation to arrest those suspected of threatening the peace of the nation. Along with those names on the union’s list for opposition, many who have been suspected of disloyalty without solid evidence too are to be targeted.\n\nPrecisely coordinated raids across London occured with Police dragging out suspected traitors to the revolution. The media arm of the Maximists, Revolutionary British People’s Broadcasting Company, have already stirred up news reports of a traitorous coup foiled by brave comrades such as Ted Lewis. The show of force across the entire city is enough to convince even the most hardcore counter-revolutionary that Mosley’s tight grip over the nation will not be easy to shake..."

uobflavour.33.d:0 "After some time pondering the consequences of the existence of a unified political opposition, Chairman Mosley came to the conclusion that the potential instability and chaos caused by the mass arrest of suspected political opponents was greater than the risk of vocal dissent. Mosley is dedicated to the liberation of the worker, if they wish to oppose him then they shall surely be swayed back. If not by Mosley’s grandiose plans for unity and peace then through newly planned “re-education centres”.\nDespite those within his inner circle disagreeing, the Chairman has refused to permit the arrests of politicians and union leaders, their links to this potential protest are dubious at best. The Chairman is confident in his ability to win the minds of the nation. Meanwhile rumours of syndicalist leaders and unions uniting against Mosley are becoming louder and louder."

uobflavour.35.d:0 "Mosley took to the platform, overlooking thousands of supporters, firmly gripping the microphone he scanned the horizon. Engulfed by the unwavering support, the chants of ‘We want Mosley!’ created an atmosphere of pure zeal. The flags of Maximist blocked the sky, a true blockade of support that towered over any attempt of protest. It is clear that the arrests worked, without leadership the opposition was powerless, Biff Boys dealt with any troublemakers brave or stupid enough to cause a scene. This rally at Cable Street, the heart of Mosley’s opposition, represented more than rhetoric. It was symbolic of the Chairman’s control over the entire nation.\n’Let us to Europe and to the world proclaim that the heart of this great people is undaunted and invincible. This flag still challenges the winds of destiny. This flame still burns. This glory shall not die. The soul of Revolution is alive, and England again dares to be great!’"

uobflavour.36.d:0 "The Maximist fears were accurate, on the day of Mosley’s most important rally hundreds and then thousands converged on Cable Street. This was to be no ordinary rally, Cable Street is the heart of his opposition, it would be here that the Chairman would announce his  radical plans of restructuring the nation. Somehow information detailing the dismissed raids had leaked to the public, an already angered populace of union workers and politicians loyal to the formerly Fed/Con controlled TUC were further galvanised by fears that their liberties are at great risk. A united demonstration prepared in the early hours of the morning by constructing makeshift barricades, by midday Mosley had to be escorted in by a convoy of police as the protestors had begun to engage directly with law enforcement. Despite the warnings of the police, Chairman Mosley refused to back down, undeterred he took to climbing on top of his escort van to declare the now rioting crowd of protesters as enemies of the nation. By this point there was no stopping the inevitable chaos.\n\nBiff Boys entered into the fray wielding clubs pushing past police officers and clashing directly with protestors, crowds swarmed each other with nearby buildings being set a torch and windows smashed. Mosley had feared such an escalation of violence would take place, he ordered the military to stand guard, as he witnessed pure mayhem he called for action. Soldiers marched through taking aim at the crowds, scrapping Biff Boys and police officers quickly fled behind the soldiers as a volley of gunfire hit the rioting mob. At once the crowd dispersed allowing the soldiers, police and maximists alike to grab whoever they could. By the end of the day Cable Street was a mess of blood, smoldering rubble and pickets torn apart, Mosley may have won the battle however the war of the populace’s minds was about to begin."

uobflavour.37.d:0 "After the revolution, the Trade Union Congress was elevated from labour union to the governmental power of the nation. The intention was to create a truly democratic system where for the first time in British history, the workers themselves could rule. However since then the TUC has degenerated into a bureaucratic and corrupt mess of political scheming. It became the new parliament. For this reason Chairman Mosley has decided to rein in the TUC, using his newfound ability to pass legislation allowing for the formation of a National Council. This council will be composed of members elected directly by the people to represent their field of expertise, much like the original goal of the TUC. However these councils will be loyal to the Chairman, they will serve to advise not to broker deals driven for personal gain. All councillors will then personally be approved by Mosley who will accept their democratic victory against their opponents. The TUC has not officially been disbanded, rather reformed into a lower house of government, the TUC will see its influence and political domination destroyed and provided with a new directive. Serve the Chairman."

uobflavour.38.d:0 "Freedom is to serve a cause. Happiness is fulfilled by duty. Liberty is to liberate your mind from mental corruption\n\nSo say the posters that line the streets of cities, towns and villages across the nation. Posters plastered in mass by loyal labourers fulfilling their duty. In Mosley’s society it matters not who you are, a lowly milkman or a brave operative of the R.E.D both serve their part in the machine of the nation. Maximism truly is the ideology for the masses for it preaches the importance of the individual as long as they work in the collective. A single person driven by self interest can achieve nothing, despite their best efforts they will one day die and be forgotten. However millions of people all working together are able to build a utopia, one that will last long beyond their natural lives. One that is built from the souls of individuals, preserving their spirit and providing immortality for the mass. You may die, but you will live on through the Chairman."

uobflavour.39.t:0 "A Union for the Unionless?"
uobflavour.39.d:0 "As the process of Devolution nears it's completion, a bill has reached the floor of the reformed TUC, calling for the creation of a special union for that section of the populace commonly referred to as the Lumpenproletariat. Also known simply as the 'Lumpenm' this portion of the populace, roughly 3-5%, are those who cannot or chose not to work, those who steal to get by, those who panhandle, the poorest of the poor in other words, those whom a more reactionary society would consider not but dirty and lazy degenerates. While the Union of Britain prided itself on it's progressive and equal laws, many of those in the TUC and even many simply within the working class, viewed held themselves to be greater then the Lumpen. Indeed, in many ways life for the Lumpen is the same under the us and it was under the Reactionaries. Unlike under the reactionaries however, the Lumpen have lost the right to vote. Due to the driving force of the Revolution being Unions, only those workers within Unions legally have the right to vote. With the Lumpen either not having work or not making enough to afford dues, they remain outside a Union, and thus outside the political process. While it is not only the Lumpen who are effected by this, some workers choose to not join a Union, they are the most overwhelming effected. Not only this, but due to them not being a members in a Union, they are oft denied social benefits, although they still have access to much more than they did under the reactionary Windsors. Due to this, and among other factors, many consider the Lumpen to be a breeding ground for reactionary idealism, which does seem to be correct.\n\n This is where the proposed bill enters the discussion. Due to the growing presence of reactionary elements within the Lumpen, and due to the fact they have been long ignored by the old corrupted TUC, the bill would have a special and due free Union created, especially for the Lumpen. While in reality, the Union would almost function solely as a meeting hall, it would allow a sizeable section of the population to finally have a voice in government. Those who oppose the bill, mostly those outside of the Autonomists, say that creating such a Union, we would encourage laziness, why work when you can simply join the Lumpen Union and reap all the benefits of a proper worker? Due to the controversial aspect of the bill, the TUC is almost evenly split. Support or condemnation from the Chairman would surely be enough to break the gridlock, and thus both sides have reached out to the Executive, and Chairman Glais is expected to make an announcement regarding the bill in the coming hours."

uobflavour.40.d:0 "In order to improve morale for our troops, the Trade Union Congress has authorized the creation of the Entertainments Revolutionary Service Association - or ERSA - as it becomes increasingly clear that this combative existence will be our reality for some time. Headed by Basil Dean and Leslie Henson, two veterans of the British limelight, ERSA aims to provide entertainment to the entirety of our armed forces, as well as some of the forces of our loyal and much-needed allies like France, no matter where in the world the coming wars might take them. \n\nThe rising star of ERSA currently is the famed actor, comedian, and singer-songwriter George Formby, who has risen to the top of ERSA’s lists thanks to a combination of his own immense talent and popularity among the troops and wider Britain, the shrewd and cunning management of his wife Beryl Ingham - who even was behind the idea to have Formby perform with his now-iconic ukulele, and to subtle manipulation by the Party due to Formby’s open and public support of Syndicalism and the TUC at large. Performing shows at fortifications, army bases, field hospitals, and even on the frontline itself, Formby goes where our men need him most as he sings his jaunty, comedic tunes much to the merriment and delight of all, putting him into consideration for some serious commendations from our military staff thanks to his heroism and bravery as a non-combatant civilian supporting our revolutionary struggle. Recently returning from a series of shows across the Franco-German border playing for our French allies on the front, Formby has already planned his next trip with ERSA as he sets his sights on another band of weary heroes in need of some R&R. Life on the front or even in one of our many guardstations and fortifications defending the coastline is a dour and depressing experience at times as the drudgery and horror of wartime gets us down, but with little rays of sunshine like George Formby and other ERSA performers, our boys just might make it through on back home."

uob.1000.d:0 "With Oswald Mosley’s absolute control over the English apparatus of state being fully secure, the various cliques and factions within the Maximist Party have begun to debate on what should be the center of our national ambitions going forward. Before us lies three paths - one where our Maximist Britain props itself as the true heir of the fallen British Empire in line with Mosley’s ideas of Anglo Exceptionalism and that the Maximist Revolution would reach the widest audience and reach its maximum potential through old Imperial channels, one based on concepts like Nation Europa and Eurafrika where our nation takes up the mantle of cohesive, syncretic Pan-European nationalism in order to preserve Western civilization and European multiculturalist perfection through pan-ethnic unity, non-federal total national amalgamation, and European chauvinism, and one where the isles of Britain and perhaps Ireland rule alone in order to save ourselves from the horrors of the outside world, though Mosley himself resists the idea of imperialist action against the Irish, himself a long proponent of Irish autonomy. Whatever the case may be, the future of Maximism must be declared now."

However, despite the fact that we may hold a large bulk of the old Imperial lands, some far-off corners of the fallen Empire that fell out of Anglo control in our absence have slipped through the crack, like the rest of British Africa, the Aden Protectorate, Belize, and other lands afar that have fallen out of loyal Anglo hands. Should we cast off these lost jewels in the British imperial crown as lost causes, or shall we sally forth under the Chairman’s wise rule and continue our conquest until every last inch of the failed British Empire as it existed before its fall following the Great War and our triumphant British Revolution have been reclaimed by rightful Maximist hands?"

uob.1002.d:0 "As our armies march across the European continent raising the banner of Maximism high in every capital in this now-united bastion of Western Civilization, the Social Union of Europe now rises under Chairman Mosley’s hand, with a new ideological and governmental direction based on his infantile and still-formulating but ingenious ideas culminating in what he has begun to call ‘Europe a Nation’ - taken from the title given to his newest essays and drafts on the subject - that pulls from similar ideas of total European national cohesion like the Eurafrika concept and ‘Nation Europa’. However, with Europe and European North Africa under our domain and now being enlightened with the glories of Maximism, perhaps it is time to put the final pieces of the full Maximist Pan-European dream into place. \n\nBased on concepts first created by his contemporary and friend, the Austrian journalist and amateur Maximist philosoph Anton Zischka, and later expanded by Mosley himself, the rest of the so-called ‘Europe a Nation’ plan theorizes that the Maximist Revolution take up the torch of civilization on the Dark Continent, conquering all of Africa and putting under an apartheid-like puppet state loyal to the Social Union and dedicated primarily to the exploitation of mineral and agricultural resources, scientific development, European settlement, and - if possible - the cultivation of some form of lesser, subordinate African Maximist system dominated by a Maximist vanguardist minority rule where the only true industry in the hands of our loyal Maximist settlers, in order to fuel the creation of a true supranational superpower centered around Europe and dedicated to the preservation of Western Civilization, Pan-European culture and ethno-nationalism, and the creation of a Maximist social utopia for our conglomerated European people, but not the revolutionary sterilized subjugates needed to make our perfect dream a reality. By harvesting, studying, and extracting every last wonder, bounty, and treasure that the African continent holds while keeping its more barbarous inhabitants on a tight leash for the good of all, the Maximist dream of a pure utopia can finally be achieved by Chairman Mosley’s mighty and unmatched hand. The only question that remains is if this long-off goal is worth the coming slog of conquering the untamed, savage, and deadly expanses of the Dark Continent."

Chief amongst his detractors have been the numerous camps of conservative generals and officers that compose much of the Union’s Old Guard. As Mosley pursues his grand ambitions further and further, he has emboldened these foes into what the state has deemed as ‘Anti-Mosleyite Action.’ These rabblerousers will cause detrimental effects to the Mosley regime’s stability, and as such, if the new Chairman seeks to hold onto his newfound position of power, they will have to be dealt with, one way or another. If Mosley instead chooses to ignore these disgruntled old wardogs, it is almost certain that, should he attempt to use the army for anything they deem to far, his administration will be quickly overcome."

After all, it was the same army that lost the home countries that now pledges loyalty to us. Who is to say that we will not fail a second time? Besides, both Scotland and Wales have begun reaching out to the Great Powers, meaning that we could poteninally drag ourselves into a disastrous war with the imperialists of the Reichspact and Entente.

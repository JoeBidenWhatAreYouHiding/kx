ENG_england_army_mutiny_desc:0 "Much of the Union is racked by internal strife as our political and military control over the nation begins to rapidly weaken.

ENG_synthetic_oil_lover_desc:0 "Domestic oil supplies won't be enough to sustain our military. Fortunately, our synthetic oil tech is nothing short of the best in the world. With the right investment, this may be enough to keep our planes flying, our tanks driving and our ships moving."
ENG_never_surrender_idea:0 "Never Surrender"

# Political Ideas #

#Starting
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_1:0"A Fractured Union"
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_1_desc:0"While unified in purpose, the political divisions in [ENG.GetNameDef] are immense. With continuous factional break-offs, splinter groups, mergers and restructuring resulting in a endlessly shifting landscape in the nation's syndicates, trade unions and cliques. This continued chaos has resulted in a great deal of turmoil for the TUC and political figures attempting to hold the country together, while trying to maintain the principles that the revolution was built upon."
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_2:0"Internal Weakness"
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_2_desc:0"With a reduction to the vast factionalism that once plagued the Union, we can begin to stand stronger than before. However, there is still progress to be made."
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_3:0"A Union United!"
ENG_Fractured_Union_Idea_3_desc:0"Our purpose unites us all: the Union stands as one against those who wish to see the death of our revolution."
ENG_workers_bastion_idea:0"Workers Bastion"
ENG_workers_bastion_idea_desc:0"Being one of the few truly Syndicalist nations on Earth, the Union attracts a huge number of workers from all across the globe; acting as a haven for those eager to escape the oppression, mistreatment and injustice they face in their own homeland. Our island in the sea shall provide them with the safety they seek in these troubled times."
ENG_global_pariah_Idea:"Global Pariah"
ENG_global_pariah_Idea_desc:"With the revolution came the near-total collapse of the British empire and, along with it, hostility from nations all across the Earth. With very few allies to assist us. With only the Commune of France and the Socialists waging their own war for unification in Italy, the Nation stands as an outcast to the rest of the world.\n\nWhile many of our nation's more elderly citizens recall the vast imports and exotic goods the former United Kingdom enjoyed from her empire, our somewhat isolated global position has allowed us to adapt and innovate with what resources we have available.\n\n§GIf we continue to expand the number Internationale members, our global position will liberate us from this legacy.§!"
ENG_militia_idea:0 "Militia-Based Military"
ENG_militia_idea_desc:0 "Unlike our Communard brothers, who relied in particular on the support of General Maurice Gamelin during their Revolution, most of the important officers of the British army opposed our Revolution in 1925, and many followed the tyrant George V into exile in Canada. As a result, most of our current armed forces are made up of militiamen who, despite their courage and determination, have little talent or experience as officers. It will be necessary to structure this disorganized whole in one way or another if we want to ensure the effectiveness of our army against the imperialists who will without a doubt try to put an end to our young Revolution."

ENG_cable_street_idea_desc:0 "The riots that took place on Cable Street showed the entire nation that not all are loyal to the Chairman, this violent outburst has lead to more members of the Union harshly criticising our administration for the poor planning and response to this confrontation. Our rule is secure and continues to be supported by those in power, but the simple existence of this struggle shows weakness in the Union. The memories of what took place at Cable Street may serve as a battle cry for those opposed to Maximism."

ENG_totalist_party:0 "Maximists/BSP"
ENG_totalist_party_long:0 "Maximists/British Socialist Party\n§gIn the aftermath of the revolution Oswald Mosley was able to cultivate a unique form of syndicalism dubbed 'Maximism', in which society must be radically transformed through the political mobilization of the Unions whole population. While to many this comes across as tyrannical, Mosley has been able to attract like-minded individuals to his cause, including many veterans of the First Weltkrieg such as Wilfred Risdon. Regardless of their popularity among the more aggressive members of the Union, a victory the British Maximists would be surprising due to their aversion to cooperation with other factions and perceived extreme standpoint.\n\nAs well as Oswald Mosley and his followers, diverse groups of both independent thinkers and factions formed from the splinters and break-off cliques from the rapidly shifting landscape of the Union's more authoritarian revolutionaries exist within these circles. The unifying factor between these movements is the desire to move away from the trade unions of Syndicalism and instead move towards centralization behind a strong executive, though the extent of this authoritarianism varies wildly between the different thinkers. While many of these smaller groups exist throughout the nation, a large majority of their members align themselves with the BSP - the British Socialist Party, due to the factions relatively high influence compared to other hardline groups.\n\nFounded by key figures such as R. Palme Dutt, Walton Newbold and Harry Pollitt, evolving and radicalising from its Marxist founding in 1911 due to the Russian Exiles that have greatly influenced the parties thinkers, the BSP seek to wholly transform the nation's overall political structure and centralize the Union under a strong leader as part of a central council of officials. With the backing and political muscle of a highly authoritarian vanguard party to defend and perpetuate the revolution, this council would seek to move the nation away for the distributed power structure that the vast majority of the more mainline socialists seek in an attempt to cement the revolutionary principles that brough them into power in the first place. However, despite the alliance of convenience between the BSP and so called "Hardliners", whom currently have no solidified party or coherent organisation beyond the camaraderie they share, see this exclusion as an act against the revolution, instead believing that the revolution and, more importantly the party, must be flexible and open enough to withstand and adapted to the challenges it may face.§!"

While noble in its aims, the small party was unable to have much impact in British political scene and saw mass defections both during the initial revolution and especially after with most of its former supporters finding a comfortable home in the Autonomists or Federationists. Currently, the Labour party exists as little more than a common denominator for many of the more moderate members of the old government that stayed loyal during the revolution. With members such as Walter Citrine, Ernest Bevin and Charles Simmons all existing as some of the Union's most tempered members that still believe in a nation for the workers.

It continues to be the only legal 'party' in the entire Union though it holds no sway in politics and is considered a non-entity by many.

POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"

POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming tensions wherever they arose and seeking to maintain a delicate balance between all six of the main factions within the nation - which is perhaps why he has continued to leave the growing radicalism that has slowly crept throughout the Union uncontested.\n\nThe former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement - an uncomfortable reality to say the least."

POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following the Federationist victory and Snowden's resignation. Mann, though a Leninist and a life-long ally and friend of Snowden, has shown great historical commitment to the trade union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service.\n\nIn his old age however, he has often received criticism for his unfaltering devotion to Snowden's principles and character, with the brunt of this criticism noting that he is even more elderly then his predecessor."

POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."

POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem 'The Red Flag' is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."

POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."

POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "To some, Lawrence is a New Cromwell, hellbent on shaping England in his dictatorial image. To others, Lawrence is the protector of British Democracy, and the savoir of the nation. Many things can be said about Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg. However, despite people’s views on him, one thing is a fact: His power over Britain is undeniable. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many now fear that his power may go to his head; and he could end up being no better than the man he deposed."

POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement.

While Attlee's army service did instill in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."

POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in an uprising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."

POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."

POLITICS_JOHN_STRACHEY_DESC:0 "Journalist by trade, Maximist disciple and close friend of Oswald Mosley, John Strachey is a name to be reckoned with and has risen exponentially in the Union of Britain. Coming off the back of Mosley's disgraceful collapse, Strachey has been poised to take the reins and has since taken the Maximists away from the cultist devotion that surrounded his friend and mentor. A self-proclaimed 'liberal Maximist', Strachey aligns closely with the economic organisation and principles of the Maximist state but is less so inclined to its totalitarian and ultra-statist philosophy."

POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affairs."

ENG_call_the_tuc_desc:0"The time has come once again to convene the Trade Union Congress. Bringing together the representatives for the multitude of unions that make up the nation’s economic workforce and political leadership, the TUC may determine the future of the nation for the foreseeable future. If the rumours are true, and the resignation of Chairman Snowden is imminent, the TUC will serve as an ideal time to elect our new Chairman thanks to the presence of all major political factions in the country, though the Congress may give birth to yet more rivalries and alliances in the process..."

ENG_voice_of_tuc:0"A Voice for the TUC?"
ENG_voice_of_tuc_desc:0"With Snowden's resignation, a temporary speaker is needed for the duration of the TUC. While abiding by the principles outlined in the revolution, there is no doubt that this temporary speaker may try to subtly direct the TUC in the direct that their political alignment wishes to see triumphant."

ENG_domestic_discussion:0"The Question at Home?"
ENG_domestic_discussion_desc:0"The Union has been on a slow decline for many years; internal factionalism, calls for independence in both Scotland and Wales, and increasing radicalism among many of the nation's high profile leaders have put the country on a slippery slope towards total collapse. We must decide at the congress how these problems are fixed, before it’s too late."

ENG_military_discussion:0"Status of the Republican Army?"
ENG_military_discussion_desc:0"Since the revolution, the majority of our defensive and offensive forces have been made up of militia formed during the uprising with little to no direct military training beyond simple use of firearms. While the Republican Army, made up of our forces from the British Army that stayed loyal during the revolution, is extremely small in size relative to the militia formations, these soldiers are adept in combat thanks to proper training and experience. Choosing to dissolve the militias and focus on more traditional warfare techniques, or simply expanding and reforming the militias must be the next point of discussion."

ENG_economy_discussion:0"The Slipping Economy?"
ENG_economy_discussion_desc:0"Our global position was once the most powerful in the world; with vast imports of exotic spices, animals, food and minerals all from the glory of the British Empire. These days are no more; with few allies in the world, our economy is almost entirely based on what resources we can find on our island - if the current trend continues our economy, though adaptable thanks to the Syndicalist and decentralised structure, may soon collapse beyond all repair. The only question is how we go about this solution."

ENG_foreign_discussion:0"Our place in the World?"
ENG_foreign_discussion_desc:0"As the Canadian exiles across the Atlantic and the Germans in Europe continue to eye up our island, we must seriously consider our position in the world. Do we choose to intervene in the socialist struggle that other nation's workers may soon face, or do we focus on our own revolution - along with the defence of both our people and way of life?"

ENG_end_the_tuc:0"Conclude the TUC"
ENG_end_the_tuc_desc:0"As the end of debate and discussion draws near, the votes may be counted for the new British leadership. Despite the promise from all factions; even the BSP and Maximists who are known for their lack of faith in the electoral process, to accept the results of the election, there are high tensions between the different organisations that make up the Congress's main political body.

ENG_FED_embrace_hornerism:0"The Embrace of 'Hornerism'"
ENG_FED_embrace_hornerism_desc:0"Now Chairman, Arthur Horner offers a form of Syndicalism that he has continued to promote since the revolution. The term 'Hornerism' originated as a term for slander against his deviating ideals in the period following the revolution, when radicalism from the BSP had began to rapidly spiral and encroach on many of the more orthodox Syndicalists in the nation. This doctrine, now accepted officially as Hornerism, encourages for the trade unions that pre-dated the revolution to continue their work and evolve into the new unions we seek, rather that the dissolution and reformation into 'revolutionary trade unions' that the BSP have promoted."

ENG_FED_dissuade_direct_action:0"Dissuade Direct Action"
ENG_FED_dissuade_direct_action_desc:0"While our current position and liberation from capitalism was brought about through the dying of our flag red with the blood of many thousands, the time for this action has long past. Our government, already one for the workers and one that will willingly cooperate to improve the lives of all rather than a select few, has often had issues with younger members of the nation still believing that the change they desire can only be brought around through the use of bombs and arson. The most prolific of this group is the WSPU; with its history deeply rooted in militant actions. While their activities have decreased immensely in the past few years, there are still occasional outbursts from a small handful of its members, such as Christabel Pankhurst, who still promotes taking matters into their own hands. By making concessions to the WSPU and wider militant organisations of the Union, we can begin to reduce this infatuation with violent means and encourage cooperation with our administration."

ENG_FED_maintain_cohesion:0"Cohesive and Defined Unions"
ENG_FED_maintain_cohesion_desc:0"Over time, the trade unions have continued to become a bloated and convoluted mess of overlaps, competing interests and contradictory goals. With certain aspects of the economy being comprised of multiple Unions, all with their own unique internal politics, policy, leadership and administration, the ability to easily govern them has become a bureaucratic nightmare; one of the many things we hoped to leave behind in the revolution. By reforming and merging some of these Unions into more defined areas and encouraging collaboration between the Unions of different industries, we can improve both the internal development of our Syndicalist ideals, as well as improve the function of the economy, something that is desperately needed in these times."

ENG_FED_follow_snowden:0"In the Steps of Snowden"
ENG_FED_follow_snowden_desc:0"Philip Snowden, a man whose name will stand eternally as one of the nations most influential figures, has now passed the torch onward to Tom Mann. Mann, a lifelong friend, colleague and proponent of Snowden's chairmanship has promised to continue to walk the tightrope that our nation finds its self standing on. While some fear that Mann will fall victim to the same errors that Snowden is claimed to have enabled, the delicate balance between the factions is yet to be disrupted. By first establishing the desires for each faction and their goals, we can begin the careful process of understanding how best to accommodate their beliefs, without brining on the collapse of our nation from internal divisions."

ENG_FED_stay_the_course:0"Stay the Course, Weather the Storm"
ENG_FED_stay_the_course_desc:0"We will not escape this political disaster we currently face by disrupting the careful balance we find ourselves in. By uprooting and rapidly changing the Union's internal structure, a rapid spiral may trigger the beginning of the end for our nation. Only by standing on our current path, abiding by the Syndicalist foundations we set out in the revolution, slowly reforming where we can and fostering peace between the factions, can we begin to claw ourselves out of this hole."

ENG_FED_discuss_WSPU:0"Make Peace with the WSPU"
ENG_FED_discuss_WSPU_desc:0"Despite the WSPU's continued, and sometimes violent, efforts to elevate the female population, it may finally be time to being working with them. Even with the vast amount of progress we have made towards female emancipation, many of their members are still unsatisfied with the perceived inequality that still exists in the Union. By at last opening negotiations and beginning cooperation with their leading council, consisting of Annie Kenny, Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst, and Teresa Billington-Greig, we can discuss what changes can be made to further close the divide between the two sexes, and perhaps find a new source of labour for our fields and factories in the process."

ENG_FED_intellectuals_socialist:0"The Intellectual's Socialist"
ENG_FED_intellectuals_socialist_desc:0"Cyril Joad, the beloved host of the popular radio show 'The Brains Trust', has promised a new direction for the Union. Not one lead by the humble coal miner and factory worker, but one lead by intelligence and discussion, inspired by the nation's other philosophers such as George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells. Chairman Joad can now begin the monumental task of transforming Syndicalism and Socialism from the ideology of the working man to the philosophy of the nation's intellectuals, teachers and academics, as well as the simple farmer and quarryman."

ENG_FED_ideological_fluidity:0"Promote Ideological Fluidity"
ENG_FED_ideological_fluidity_desc:0"Rejecting the restraints imposed by any single ideology, the new chairman has already promoted the idea of "ideological fluidity". Instead of tying down the nation's political scene to a single form of socialism, Joad has continued to advertise a brand of thinking that carefully examines other socialist ideologies for aspects that can benefit our own. Drawing from the principles of Guild Socialism he follows currently, to Fabianist influences from his early life, orthodox Syndicalism from the wider federationists, and more rarely, the more moderate form of Maximism promoted by John Strachey in Oswald Mosley's own movement."

ENG_FED_rationality_not_radicalism:0"Rationality, Not Radicalism"
ENG_FED_rationality_not_radicalism_desc:0"The ever increasing radicalism has tainted our nation for decades at this point. Initially spiralling from the BSP during the revolution, which was only exacerbated with the arrival of Soviet generals and their more authoritarian brands of socialism, the Union is on its last legs from endless infighting and factional rivalries. We must encourage the masses, many of which are apathetic to the country's leaders on the basis their living conditions do not worsen, to think logically about the decisions they make in regards to their trade unions politics, rather than diving headfirst into the more extreme areas of political thought at the first sign of negative change. Youth movements stand popular with the BSP, the Maximists entice large swathes of our veterans, many women align with the WSPU, leaving us in a position where many would drift away from our movement, unless we can broaden this mantra of logic and reasonable thought."

ENG_FED_rework_the_old:0"Reform through Understanding"
ENG_FED_rework_the_old_desc:0"Harold Laski's victory for the Chairmanship has prompted a swift change in how we shall develop the Union going forward. Instead of seeing the other factions beliefs as a threat to our own way of thinking, we must instead consider why they think like this in the first place. The anger and radicalism that many of the Union's most high-profile thinkers subscribe to has not appeared for no reason; it is our own failings that have brought this on. By understanding why this has happened, and what they wish to see changed, we can begin to cure this extremist way of thinking by tackling the source of the problem directly, rather than simply attempting to treat the symptoms."

ENG_FED_new_economic_architecture:0"The Architect of a New Economy"
ENG_FED_new_economic_architecture_desc:0"As out economy stagnates from lack of potential trade partners, we must carefully consider how every resource available to us is used. Excess production and under consumption both result in wasteful products which will irreversibly drain our limited pool of raw supplies. By establishing a central planning commission for assigning extraction, production and output quotas, we can ensure that only the required materials are produced for both civilian and military needs."

ENG_FED_left_book_club:0"Establish the Left Book Club"
ENG_FED_left_book_club_desc:0"In the development of the socialist utopia we seek, we must ensure that all members of our population, be it young or old, are aware of the journey we are on. The brainchild of Chairman Laski, publisher Victor Gollancz and most surprisingly, Maximist John Strachey, the Left Book Club will seek to spread our message throughout the populace, through books chosen monthly by a panel of thinkers from across the nation's political spheres. This move has already been accepted and praised by groups from almost all of the Union's factions, for its simple and fair approach to selecting which literature is distributed. Some Anarchists, such as Charles Lahr, have even requested multiple copies of the monthly books to sell in their own book stores."

ENG_FED_revolutionary_backbone:0"The Backbone of Any Great Revolution"
ENG_FED_revolutionary_backbone_desc:0"The miners of a country can, at their will, grind the entire nation to a halt with their refusal to work. With no coal or iron, almost all domestic production can be stopped and only started again once they have chosen to return to work. As with our own revolution, with a mass movement of miners and quarrymen as the spine of a movement, revolutions can be incited in almost any well-established economy. We must respect and benefit these men accordingly - they brought upon our own Syndicalist revolution, and may be the key to encouraging many more."

ENG_FED_interloper_accord:0"Review the 'Advisory' Position of Interlopers"
ENG_FED_interloper_accord_desc:0"Generals such as Percy Hobart have always existed in a precarious and uneasy position within the Union's army. It is known they hold contempt for our government, but their military expertise has proven invaluable for our own army's development. The time has come to review the deal that was made shortly after the revolution: should these generals be allowed to maintain advisory positions within the armed forces, or should we at last force them to retire into the background of the nations fighting force?"

ENG_FED_phs_foundations:0"Prepare a Foundation for the PHS"
ENG_FED_phs_foundations_desc:0"To care for the citizens of any society is one of the key purposes of government and administration. A leader who lets their populace fall to sickness, disease and injury is no better than one who actively harms them. By creating the PHS, the Public Health Service, we can ensure that the people of Britain are born healthy, treated throughout their lives, and die painlessly. While this will be costly in the short term and will require constant maintenance, the creation of this service will ensure the good health of all peoples, regardless of their occupation."

ENG_FED_an_education_in_ideals:0"An Education in Syndicalist Ideals"
ENG_FED_an_education_in_ideals_desc:0"The true Syndicalist utopia we seek is not an achievement that will come easily. Vast swathes of our nation still do not truly understand what this entails, with many just being content to live in a nation that values their work and treats them with equality. The majority of workers, almost entirely concentrated in rural areas of farmers, miners and craftsmen, do not grasp the political aspects of the ideology, only the aspects that have a direct effect on their working conditions and livelihood. By implementing new courses in the nation's schools and libraries, we can begin to educate those on what a true Syndicalism should entail. This program will guarantee that those in power of trade unions maintain the line that we have committed ourselves to, lest they risk the workers identifying their transgressions and outing them for their selfish ways."

ENG_FED_individual_assistance:0"Assist Individuals in Need"
ENG_FED_individual_assistance_desc:0"Occupied in their works, many within Britain have found their place as a cog of our Syndicalist machine, rewarded for their efforts and compensated accordingly. There are, however, some who are incapable of work in many of the factories and fields; whether this be from injury, disability, age or illness. By implementing financial or material support for these individuals to assist in their lives, such as specialist positions in administrative roles, we can guarantee a world in which every person works for everyone else. People shall work for the benefit of their peers, and their peers shall work for the benefit of other."

ENG_FED_ally_christians:0"Find Support Among the Nation's Christians"
ENG_FED_ally_christians_desc:0"The declaration that religion be the "opiate of the masses" by Marx has resulted in great numbers of the Protestant and Catholics within our churches to flee during the revolution, resulting in many of them falling into varying states of disrepair. Nevertheless, many devout Anglicans still reside here, following their own blend of Christian teachings with the doctrines of Socialism. By formally building ties with these priests and bishops, our rule can be further legitimised to appeal to Christians overseas, displaying that religion and Socialism can coexist and benefit one another."

ENG_FED_humanitarian_league:0"Reintroduce the Humanitarian League"
ENG_FED_humanitarian_league_desc:0"In 1891, Salt co-founded the Humanitarian League, which aimed to promote humaneness and advocate for social and legal reforms. The League's philosophy was rooted in the belief that scientific advances and evolutionary biology had debunked long-held notions of differences between races, classes, and species, advocating for universal sympathy. "

ENG_FED_union_of_cooperation:0"A Truly United Union"
ENG_FED_union_of_cooperation_desc:0"It is only through the cooperation of thousands of workers that our revolution was successful in exiling the monarchists and aristocrats all those years ago. We must reinvigorate this same energy: the belief that by working together, we truly can achieve the workers paradise we wish to see descend upon the world. Deployments of propaganda, new radio broadcasts, films and rallies shall all help to bring the Union closer together, regardless of how individuals choose to align themselves. Soldiers will remember every worker that helped create the bullet they fire or the bomb they drop." 

ENG_FED_vulgarity_of_wealth:0"Call Out the Vulgarity of Wealth"
ENG_FED_vulgarity_of_wealth_desc:0"The wealth that has been hoarded by parts of the world is sickening. While natives starve in Africa and toil to the crack of a whip, the Kaiser holds grand balls and lavish banquets for himself and the aristocrats who benefit from this excessive wealth. By reiterating the economic divide between the worlds poorest and richest, we can encourage our population to take action against gaudy displays of wealth and encourage more charitable actions. The sharing of wealth among our citizens should encourage cooperative development in communities which may be struggling, rather then relying on external financial support."

ENG_FED_freedom_of_choice:0"The Liberty to Choose their Lives"
ENG_FED_freedom_of_choice_desc:0"Individual freedom should be our upmost concern. The BSP would see the population formed into a single hegemony where all loyalty is to the party and nothing else, with the Maximists requiring that all individuals involve themselves in the revolution, whether they want to or not. We must respect the choices and alliances that our population chooses to form amongst themselves, even if it goes against our best interest. We will, of course, restrict this to peaceful activites, and any found to be forming subversive groups to assist in hostile invasions will be dealt with accordingly. The formation of sports clubs, cultural groups, and internal communities will strengthen the Union through its diversity."

ENG_FED_pacifism_cool:0"Oppose the Slaughter of War"
ENG_FED_pacifism_cool_desc:0"The First Weltkrieg was by far the most brutal, inhumane and mechanical war the world has ever seen. Endless numbers of young men cut down by constant machine gun fire, blinded in gas attacks and, in some cases, quite literally blown to pieces by artillery shells. These men could have gone on to become the leaders, teachers and doctors of today, but instead lie dead at the will of a small number of individuals. We must oppose these horrors, regardless of what is being fought for; no war is worth the future of a nation, not even an inch of territory is worth any amount of blood."

ENG_FED_peace_by_force:0"Accept the Futility of Pacifism"
ENG_FED_peace_by_force_desc:0"A hard truth to accept, but a truth nonetheless, is that war is unavoidable. As long as there's two people left on the planet, someone is going want someone dead, and there is no use in us cowering from this fact. While pacifism and conscientious objection have always been core tenants of Socialism in Britain, it may finally be time to accept this viewpoint is no longer tenable. There is no use in us refusing to resist when the enemy has stepped foot on our island, with all intention to destroy our way of life."

ENG_FED_born_anew:0"The British Dream Realised"
ENG_FED_born_anew_desc:0"It was nothing but a dream at the end of the TUC, but by a miracle and masterful political manoeuvring, we have done it. The radicals of the Union such as Oswald Mosley and Palme Dutt, while still influential, have withered in popularity enough that they no longer pose a threat to the true Syndicalism that we have now achieved. Moderation, understanding and compromise have triumphed over destructive radicalism and excessive militarism: a truly British union has risen to the task of standing as a Syndicalist beacon of hope for all the world's workers."

#WSPU
ENG_1936_WSPU_Victory:0"The WSPU Victory"
ENG_1936_WSPU_Victory_desc:0"The WSPU have come out victorious in the TUC. With its members now in charge of the future planning and development of the Union, it is expected that the unbalanced power that men have experienced for centuries will begin to fade from existence."

ENG_WSPU_expansion:0"Open Up the WSPU to our Allies"
ENG_WSPU_expansion_desc:0"While the WSPU has championed for the rights and development of women since 1903, it has championed for the rights of women only. Men, despite a fair number of them wishing to join, have been banned from joining the organisation and obtaining membership ever since its founding. While other groups, such as 'The Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement' and the 'Men's League for Women's Suffrage' have attracted members in swathes since the revolution, they have never matched the size of the WSPU. By finally removing this ban on male membership and offering the MPU and MLWS an official merging of our organisation with theirs, the ranks of the WSPU will be bolstered massively - improving both our image to the public and the political strength that we wield."

ENG_WSPU_armed_and_ready:0"The People Armed and Ready"
ENG_WSPU_armed_and_ready_desc:0"A war is coming; this is undeniable, and we have no intention of allowing the enemy to reverse the progress we have already made. The men and women of the nation must understand that this war will only be won with the help of them all, no matter their background or experience in combat. With the WSPU's members already having experience with sabotage, concentrated in urban environments, we will begin slow preparation for the inevitable arrival of our enemies."

ENG_WSPU_suffrage_dramas:0"Satirise the Opposition's Weakness"
ENG_WSPU_suffrage_dramas_desc:0"Satire and comedy have always been a core aspect for spreading the Suffrage message; the WSPU was even one of the first groups to use comedic satire to mock our political opponents. This broad appeal of humour allowed for our message to be spread much more rapidly and improve the public image of the group in the process. By reintroducing suffrage dramas with government funding to improve both their quality and scale, tensions that may arise from the changes to the government can be defused through laughter and humour, humanising our movement and the changes that will come with it."

ENG_WSPU_status_of_unions:0"The Status of the Unions"
ENG_WSPU_status_of_unions_desc:0"Christabel Pankhurst, by far one of the most militant members of our movement, has started to discuss the possibility of restructuring the nation’s trade unions. While an extremely small number of the WSPU's members agree with this point, almost entirely members of Christabel's own clique of radical militants, we cannot deny that the trade unions may need reform. The vast majority of senior Union positions in the nation are held by men, and it may finally be time to change their operation to more easily allow for women to both join and progress up the unions ranks. The only question is how far these reforms go, if at all?"

ENG_WSPU_legacy_of_action:0"Take Pride in a Legacy of Action"
ENG_WSPU_legacy_of_action_desc:0"The women of the WSPU have always been women of action, discontent to merely sit idle and hope the change they desire comes on its own and exemplified by its motto "Deeds not words". Instead taking up arms against the government - postal bombings, arson, assassination and improvised explosive were all used to commit a terror campaign the nation had never seen before. This experience can be shared with both the younger members of our movement as well as those in the army; teaching effective use of improvised weaponry against the enemy."

ENG_WSPU_mend_the_divisions:0"Two Movements Sanding as One"
ENG_WSPU_mend_the_divisions_desc:0"While the government has already began to make a change, the internal divisions of the movement are still present; Christabel continues to preach highly militant actions which often agitate the feelings of many of the other movement's more moderate members such as her own sister, Sylvia. By finally and officially merging the WSPU and the WFL to form the PSPU - The People's Social and Political Union, the divisions that have continually hampered the party can finally be put to rest, ushering in a new beginning for equality."

ENG_WSPU_hunt_cat_and_mouse_desc:0"In an attempt to stifle our movement, the now-exiled government introduced varying laws, now referred to as the 'Cat and Mouse' laws for its similarity between a cat toying with its prey before killing it, to shift the blame of our activists mistreatment in prison away from themselves. After force-feeding members of the suffragette movement, prisoners were released until they had recovered from the condition they had developed during their hunger strikes. These prisoners were then re-arrested, with no additional crime being committed, and taken back to prison to continue their sentence; if a activist were to perish during this time of brief freedom, be it from their weakened state or the effects of pneumonia that were common after force feedings, the government would take no responsibility for this death. We must begin to implement reforms and new standards to restrict the creation of such laws under our new administration to prevent this blatant cruelty from ever occurring again."

Although many of their members also swear their loyalty to Mosley's Maximist party, Sarah Campbell, the wife of Central Council member John Campbell and leader of the LLEx's women's section, has assured that loyalty to the nation first is at the forefront of their movement.

This ends now, our new party shall stand for the revolution, but on its own terms. It is true that the party must defend her people - but it must not be immutable; it must be capable of adapting and changing to meet the challenges it may face, instead of attempting to deceive and lie to the population to protect its own status as an absolute authority."

Many members of both the Federationists and WSPU, while still against our policy of centralisation, have found our movement much more agreeable than both Dutt's BSP and Mosley's Maximists. By improving our relations with key figures such as Annie Kenny, Sylvia Pankhurst, Ernest Allen and Arthur Horner, we can continue to solidify our new party as the legitimate candidates for leadership, rather than being seen as nothing more than an illegitimate coup."

Protest and riots such as these are far more costly to an administration when compared to simply governing their people in a way that they wish to be governed. Our new party will not fall prey to the errors of the previous; we shall protect our population not through fear and paranoia, but through the use of action where necessary, and freedom where possible."

This should not, however, dissuade the individual soldier from committing acts of bravery and heroism on their own accord.

Headed by Wal Hannington since its founding - a man already a close associate of our current governments inner party members, the NUWM has been a great boon to our nations development, helping those out of work to find employment in almost any form of industry. By officially bringing the NUWM under our own direct control and encouraging membership, those that are still out of work in our nation can easily be directed towards public works projects and development of key industries."

Social and Liberal Democracy exist merely as a final attempt to win over the workers support when all other means of control at the disposal of bourgeois societies have failed. All forms of Democracy are simply in place to sustain a world that would allow capitalism to exist: the workers have been led astray by this deception and subterfuge. We will propose a new alliance to our allies, one entirely against any and all bourgeois political, societal and economic control, promising a new revolution to utterly destroy the weakness that plagues the current Internationale."

In their sharp black uniforms, the sights of these men marching in parades can begin to slowly convert even the most well entrenched political adversaries towards our cause. By accentuating their image as the Union's protectors with an increase in propaganda and funding, the image of the Biff Boys can be oriented towards a more professional and refined unit, rather than the band of thugs that jump at the opportunity for violence when given the chance."

Outlining a great reworking that would move the nation away from its reliance on foreign imports, a problem that plagues us to this day, towards an Autarkic and Corpocratic system that would be used to revitalise the dying economy that we have suffered with for years. The time has finally come to propose the Second Mosley Memorandum. We must decide on how forcefully this change be required, as attempting to reconstruct our nation's internal workings this early on into our administration may be an unpopular move."

This proof of the systems has made it clear; we must reform the Chairmanship to ensure this legacy continues and our nation may be allowed to thrive even further. With the broad support gained from the Second Mosley Memorandum, one designed to be agreeable to the majority of the Union's factions, the moderate reforms to the Chairman's powers should be widely accepted and encouraged by the nation and its many bickering factions."

It is not only Chairman Mosley that receives this distrust, but the vast numbers of generals, pilots and admirals too that were once members of well-to-do families. This endless slighting and off-handed disrespect must end now, no longer will people be burdened by the name they hold or the house they were raised in; we cannot truly call ourselves a socialist nation if the population still brings up scars of the past for the sake of classist distrust and personal animosity."

The Maximist Defence Force, or MDF, must be founded from an elite subsection of ideologically devoted soldiers, given specialist training, equipment and missions that many ordinary soldiers would be woefully incapable of undertaking themselves.

ENG_the_defender_of_liberty_desc:0 "Lawrence is not an autocrat. He is a man who took power to keep England safe from tyrants and away from the dangers of complete anarchy. He is a defender of all English liberties, and a man who won’t use undemocratic measures to Keep England Safe. Lawrence is the Defender of the very foundations of our island, one who intervenes when the people's will is under threat."
ENG_restore_socialist_democracy:0 "A Shining Socialist Democracy"
ENG_restore_socialist_democracy_desc:0 "Lawrence being Head of State was always meant to be temporary. As such, the time has come to restore the rule of the people and the Unions.

ENG_formalize_militia_desc:0 "The Home Guard has been a loyal ally to Britain throughout the years.

ENG_increase_military_funding_desc:0 "Funds that may be essential to the military are currently diverted into a nightmare of civilian bureaucracy where they sit idle, waiting for decisions to be made on how best to spend them. This is a blatant waste of funds that could greatly benefit certain aspects of our national defence. We must set new, higher standards for the the level of funding that the military recieves, diverting it from the potential waste it was destined for.

ENG_empower_army_loyalists_desc:0 "Those members of the army that were loyal to Lawrence from the beginning deserve the greatest reward.

ENG_moderate_british_socialism_desc:0 "Lawrence, while a transitional figure of authority, has taken certain steps to limit the influence of politicians from the ‘Old’ Union of Britain. The bickering and infighting of the ineffective TUC of old was a direct factor in the run up to the previous Union's collapse.

uobplaceholder.0.t:0 "The New Britain"
uobplaceholder.0.d:0 "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany dragged on inconclusively for two years. In 1921, the stalemate was finally broken when Lloyd-George agreed to the German proposal of a "Peace with Honour". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, content to build socialism in isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nWith the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, cracks are rapidly emerging in the Union's political scene. Plauged by infighting, factionalism and distrust, the TUC has become an ineffective institution weakened by the web of ideologies that have emerged since its founding. As the nation's economy begins to stagnate, weakened by its position as a global outcast alongside the French Commune and Socialist Republic of Italy, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories, though some would simply accept surviving these uncertain times. One thing is clear however, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
uobplaceholder.0.a:0 "Fascinating."

uobplaceholder.1000.t:0"Preparing the TUC"
uobplaceholder.1000.d:0"Before the TUC can officially open and begin the discussions, we must first make the proper preparations. Most important of these is the invitation of the varying trade union representatives and high-profile political figures and their followers that make up the political and industrial workings of the nation. It is expected that the representatives for many of the largest and most influential factions will be arriving soon after the invitations are sent, as this is an occasion that many of their leaders have been anticipating.\n\nIf the rumours are true and Chairman Snowden does intend on stepping down, candidates for the new Chairman, or a potential Chairwoman, will first need to be proposed by each faction before the TUC can being its debates as to the direction of our ailing nation."
uobplaceholder.1000.a:0"Send out the invitations at once."

uobplaceholder.1.t:0"Philip Snowden Steps Down"
uobplaceholder.1.d:0"In a move that has shocked very few of the Union's officials, the ageing Chairman, Philip Snowden, has announced his immediate resignation. Citing a multitude of factors such as his advanced age, ailing health from stress, time with his family and guilt over how the Union has deteriorated under his chairmanship, the now former Chairman announced his resignation through a speech broadcast to the nation.\n\nWhile this comes as no surprise to the vast majority of people, with many even praising his efforts and decision to step down before the worst occurs, many more are concerned that this move will only draw the nation into further chaos as the TUC begins; claiming Snowden was the thing keeping the Union together, and peace between the factions..."
uobplaceholder.1.a:0"An unsurprising move, but perhaps poorly timed."

uobplaceholder.2.t:0"The WSPU-WFL Arrive at the Congress"
uobplaceholder.2.d:0"The first of the prospective factions to arrive has been the WSPU-WFL, made up of a coalition between the Women's Social and Political Union and the Women's Freedom League. While acting as a single unified party, the WSPU-WFL coalition is split between its more moderate members, such as Teresa Billington-Greig, who wish to abide by the democratic process of the Union no matter what, operating within the nation's legal bounds. The more militant leaning members however, such as the Pankhurst sisters Christabel and Sylvia, and Annie Kenny, believe that in times where a government refuses to acquiesce to the demands of the people, direct action must be taken - though many believe that Christabel Pankhurst takes the desire for militant action far beyond the necessary or desired amount.\n\nIf they are to be successful in the upcoming election, a candidate for the first potential Chairwoman is required from them; who should it be?"
uobplaceholder.2.a:0"Annie Kenney is chosen as candidate."
uobplaceholder.2.b:0"Christabel Pankhurst is nominated for the position."
uobplaceholder.2.c:0"Sylvia Pankhurst is nominated."
uobplaceholder.2.e:0"Teresa Billington-Greig is selected."

uobplaceholder.3.t:0"The Anarchists Arrive at the Congress"
uobplaceholder.3.d:0"Arriving surprisingly early considering their strong dislike for the Union's politics, the United Socialist Movement have arrived at the congress. Acting as its current organiser, it is expected that Guy Aldred will be nominated as their prospective candidate due to his effectiveness at catering to the wildly diverse organisation. While skilled at reducing tensions due to his willingness to work with other factions, other candidates such are making clear their desire for nomination.\n\nIn recent years, Charles Lahr, most known for his small publishing operation that has helped to slowly grow the USM's popularity, has gained many friends in the literary and artistic circles. This business has elevated him as popular candidate with many among the Anarchists - though his extremely brief time as a member of the British Socialist Party, once much more moderate than the organisation is has become today, has caught the ire of some of the most devout members of the USM.\n\nIn addition to Aldred and Lahr however, members such as Leah Feldman, who remains a highly popular figure among many of the Eastern-European migrants and political refugees, as well as the nation's Bundists due to both her Ukrainian birth and Jewish heritage. Standing as another candidate, Ethel Mannin, who often finds herself subtly supported by many of the WSPU's members on issues due to her popular writings and continued support for women's suffrage, has also made clear her desire to be nominated."
uobplaceholder.3.a:0"Guy Aldred, current organiser of the USM."
uobplaceholder.3.b:0"Charles Lahr, friend of many writers, is nominated."
uobplaceholder.3.c:0"Leah Feldman is proposed."
uobplaceholder.3.e:0"Anarcha-Feminist Ethel Mannin will serve the Union well."

uobplaceholder.4.t:0"The Federationists Arrive at the Congress"
uobplaceholder.4.d:0"With Snowden's resignation, Arthur Horner was named as the desired successor for the former Chairman. While remaining a popular figure among the Federationists due to his relatively moderate beliefs, even being a respected figure by many of the nation's Autonomists such as Niclas Y Glais due to his contribution to the Miners Federation in South Wales, some have questioned if abiding by Snowden's wishes would be our best move. Stating the continuous increase in radicalism as their main concern, in combination with fears that Horner would too closely follow Snowden's doctrine of merely keeping the peace rather than curbing the more extreme factions. Despite this, Horner has made clear that we will not simply follow what has already been written, but instead take a stance against this extremism.\n\nHowever, in spite of Snowden's wishes, Tom Mann may act as an alternative to Horner. Mann has the advantage of being more senior than his associates which has allowed him to develop a much stronger relationship with the former Chairman, knowing Snowden well and being well liked in return, though his age has raised numerous concerns. Mann is himself even more elderly than Snowden, and it has been feared that he may succumb to illness far sooner than hoped. Nevertheless, his advanced age has been brushed off by many having been a strong supporter of Syndicalism for nearly his entire life, though he may experience the harsh criticism that Snowden faced for his age and be seen as a individual from an age of Syndicalism that has passed.\n\nFor this reason, both C.E.M Joad; popular for his ardent pacifism throughout the First Weltkrieg as well as his fairly flexible outlook on the nation's future, and Harold Laski have been raised as prospective candidates. Laski, despite receiving political attacks for his supposedly 'antithetical' ideology, remains highly popular among many of the more senior members of the TUC due to his time as a lecturer, with vast numbers of these members once being his students and somewhat inheriting aspects of his ideology themselves."
uobplaceholder.4.a:0"Arthur Horner, current General Secretary of the Union and Snowden's requested successor."
uobplaceholder.4.b:0"His age is not a concern if his devotion makes up for it; Tom Mann is nominated."
uobplaceholder.4.c:0"Popular thinker and controversialist Cyril Joad is nominated."
uobplaceholder.4.e:0"Harold Laski, despite his somewhat inconsistent ideology, is selected."

uobplaceholder.5.t:0"The Autonomists Arrive at the Congress"
uobplaceholder.5.d:0"Next to arrive at the TUC are the so called Autonomist faction. Made up of many of members from the Union's constituent nations, Scotland and Wales, the Autonomists exist as once of the most politically moderate bodies in the nation. Still strongly Syndicalist, some often consider the Autonomists as a 'single issue group', with much of their movement united under the sole ambition for higher levels of independence and devolution in the Union. Due to this aim in reducing centralisation, they often find themselves continually under attack by both the BSP and Maximists. Whether this be achieved through national councils established in the home nations' territory, independence from the Union while maintaining military, economic and political ties, or most radically, complete and total independence from England, the Autonomists have continually failed to make a great impact on the TUC's outcomes due to their relatively small appeal.\n\nThis however, has often meant their allies come from places that many find confusing or unexpected, where desperation has forced them to relinquish certain policies in favour of increased political support. Overtime, allies have included members of the USM such as Scottish-born Anarchist Ethel MacDonald, leading figure in the Red Clydeside era Willie Gallacher, and varying members of Christian Socialist movements such as Anglican priest John Groser. These allies have at times even included members of Cornish Nationalist movements such as the group Tyr ha Tavas, that would see Cornwall become its own independent, self-governing state, though many believe that this movement pushes the limits of the Autonomist's capabilities."
uobplaceholder.5.a:0"Niclas Y Glais, the Autonomists' current leader is nominated."
uobplaceholder.5.b:0"David Kirkwood, a hero of the Red Clydeside era, is chosen as candidate."

uobplaceholder.6.t:0"Radicals Arrive at the Congress"
uobplaceholder.6.d:0"The final of the main factions to arrive has been both the BSP, representing the most ardent Socialists in the Union under the leadership of Palme Dutt and the party's Central Council, as well as Oswald Mosley's clique of Maximists. Due to their outlining party structure and faction loyalties, there is no doubt that Palme Dutt will be the nominated candidate for the BSP, and Oswald Mosley representing the Maximists.\n\nWith their arrival, the nation’s main representatives of the varying factions, trade unions and interest groups have convened, and the congress may at last begin. The outcome of this congress may determine the future of the Union, so we must carefully consider how each issue be resolved."
uobplaceholder.6.a:0"Let us begin then."

uobplaceholder.7.t:0"The TUC's Temporary Speaker"
uobplaceholder.7.d:0"With the resignation of the now former Chairman Philip Snowden, a newly chosen interim speaker will be required for the TUC. In charge of directing the congress and ensuring all topics are discussed in both a timely and civilized matter, the Speaker may hold a great amount of sway over the overall outcome of the TUC, whether it be for better or for worse. Who should fill this role of Speaker?"
uobplaceholder.7.a:0"Mosley is a fierce orator - he will control things well."
uobplaceholder.7.b:0"Dutt of the BSP will ensure things go smoothly."
uobplaceholder.7.c:0"Go with Aldred from the USM, he is well versed in balancing factionalism."
uobplaceholder.7.e:0"Let Niclas of the Autonomists direct the TUC."
uobplaceholder.7.f:0"Horner was a friend of Snowden, best we go with him."
uobplaceholder.7.g:0"Annie Kenny has always been skilled at public speaking."

uobplaceholder.8.t:0"Discussion of the Union's Internal Structure"
uobplaceholder.8.d:0"With the recent increase in both radical movements and factionalism, the domestic policy of the Union has become a hotly debated topic.\n\nThe Maximists and BSP, while both advocating for a much stronger executive and curbing of pacifism common in other factions such as the Federationists, differ in opinion on how this should be done; the Maximists advocating for the mass movement of all of the Union's citizens in defence of the revolution, while the BSP state that only a strong party can defend the nations people - rooting out those deemed a threat in the process.\n\nThe Anarchists, expectedly, oppose this notion; stating that the convoluted nature of the Union's politics stands in the way of true freedom. They wish to further reduce the control that the congress holds over the nation, liberating the nations people in the process.\n\nWhile agreeing somewhat with the Anarchists, the Autonomists deem that the Union's home nations; England, Scotland and Wales, must be allowed to choose their own future, but a political and military alliance between them should still be maintained for the mutual benefit of all.\n\nThe Federationists, having ruled the Union for just over a decade at this point, seek to continue the status quo that has brought the revolution this far, while defending against both more authoritarian radicals who believe the revolution has failed to go far enough and those who would wish to see the revolution undone entirely.\n\nRepresenting the interest of the nation's women, the WSPU have been petitioning to close the divide between the sexes even further, pointing out the comparatively large number of high-ranking political and military figures that are men, with relatively few of the nation’s influential political positions being filled by women, as proof that there is still a bias within the Union's politics."
uobplaceholder.8.a:0"Mosley is right - everyone must play their part."
uobplaceholder.8.b:0"The BSP make an excellent point - the party must defend her people."
uobplaceholder.8.c:0"The Anarchists are correct - the Union has become too restrictive."
uobplaceholder.8.e:0"The Autonomists know what’s best - push for devolvement."
uobplaceholder.8.f:0"The Federationists have gotten us this far - stick with the status quo."
uobplaceholder.8.g:0"The WSPU win out - push for equality above all."

uobplaceholder.9.t:0"Status of the Republican Military"
uobplaceholder.9.d:0"With ever increasing tensions in the world, the status of our military, or lack of military, has been chosen to be discussed next. Currently, the majority of the defensive and offensive foot soldiers in our nation consist of disorganised militia with no strong command structure, instead relying on officer independence and initiative to make the majority of tactical decisions. While a very small number of 'official' Republican Army divisions with proper training and equipment exist - many being left over from the first Weltkrieg, they are so few in number that in the event of a wide-scale conflict, they would be useful as little more than shock troops.\n\nWe must decide how this restructuring will come around - if at all. While it would be wise to follow through on these plans, many of the nation's more senior figures understand that our army may have to adapt to suit our needs when required, as opposed to trying to plan an entire wars outcome before its even begun."
uobplaceholder.9.a:0"The Maximists prove correct - our Army must be aggressive." #mobile warfare - tank focus bc veterans wouldnt want a bloody war/liddell hart
uobplaceholder.9.b:0"Dutt's BSP take this one - we must overrun our enemies." #mass assault - infantry focus
uobplaceholder.9.c:0"The USM are right - maintain army flexibility." #general (As in boost to generals) boosts - not encouraged to take any doctrine
uobplaceholder.9.e:0"The Autonomists know what to do - push for officer initiative." #general boots + grand battle
uobplaceholder.9.f:0"The Federationists plan - develop the Republican army and expand the militias separately." #grand battle + special forces + militia
uobplaceholder.9.g:0"The WSPU win out - our people’s lives are valuable." #artillery focus

uobplaceholder.10.t:0"Direct the Crumbling Economy"
uobplaceholder.10.d:0"The great loss of our global hegemony that resulted from the revolution came as somewhat of a shock to our economy; with no prior adjustment, our entire nation underwent one of the greatest territorial losses the world has ever seen in a matter of weeks. While our Syndicalist nature has allowed for a fairly swift reorganisation of industry, both military and civilian, to suit out current situation, the effects of what was lost can still be felt in the slow stagnation that the Union has experienced over the past decade. Now fully reliant on whatever resources we have on our island and those available to our few allies, a new change may be needed for our economic direction. We must decide what this direction be - though the bickering factions may make this difficult."
uobplaceholder.10.a:0"We must centralise and militarise as per Mosley's vision."
uobplaceholder.10.b:0"Dutt is correct - nothing short of total militarisation will suffice."
uobplaceholder.10.c:0"An agrarian approach praised by the USM will benefit our many farmers."
uobplaceholder.10.e:0"The Autonomists approach - a hybrid structure is the best of both options."
uobplaceholder.10.f:0"Mix civilian and military industrialisation - the Federationists' plan."
uobplaceholder.10.g:0"Follow the WSPU's ideas - focus on civilian works."

uobplaceholder.11.t:0"The Nation's Place in the World"
uobplaceholder.11.d:0"Our revolution has transformed our nation from a fiefdom of kings and aristocrats to a workers paradise, but this new-found liberty did not come for free. The power and influence that the British Empire once held has now crumbled to dust, with what little influence the empire had left now cowering in Canada. Despite our influence among many of the worlds current governments, we hold a huge amount of influence among the socialist governments and political groups that live under the surface in much of the world. The point of discussion has come to this; how should we support these governments and groups, if at all, despite the numerous problems we face on our own island?\n\nThe Maximists and BPB both support similar notions of direct intervention through the use of supplying equipment and volunteer divisions when possible, though many in the Union's more moderate circles believe that this will be perceived as hostile actions and foreign meddling.\n\nThe Autonomists have voiced the belief that only intervention in wars of "liberation" should be considered, believing we should ignore intervention in aggressive wars of expansion and instead focus on promoting self-determination for oppressed minority groups and independence movements. Though this contrasts with the USM's belief that foreign intervention of almost all kinds - outside of volunteer forces of course, should be avoided due to a belief that this intervention is just another tool for governments to exert their influence.\n\nClosely allied, both the Federationists and WSPU believe in foreign intervention where necessary. The Federationists proposing that we should first focus on the defeat of Germany and Canada as they both pose as an active threat to the nation, while the WSPU have often stated we should first focus on internal development and evolution before turning are view outwards."
uobplaceholder.11.a:0"Do as the Maximists say - the masses must be uplifted."
uobplaceholder.11.b:0"We cannot stand idle, the BSP know that revolutions will not happen on their own."
uobplaceholder.11.c:0"Authoritarianism must come to an end, Side with the USM."
uobplaceholder.11.e:0"The Autonomists are right - promote self-determination for the oppressed."
uobplaceholder.11.f:0"The Federationists line hasn't failed us so far - focus on Canada and Germany first."
uobplaceholder.11.g:0"As per the WSPU, we must improve the Union and uplift the nations women."

uobplaceholder.12.t:0"An Unexpected Alliance"
uobplaceholder.12.d:0"Seeing their lack of influence this far into the TUC, in a move that has caught the ire of the other factions, the Autonomists and United Socialist Movement have formed a shaky coalition in an attempt to use their combined support to achieve a majority in the congress. While many members in the USM and broader Anarchist circles strongly disagree with the Autonomists' desire for devolution - seeing it as nothing more than giving into regional nationalism by drawing additional lines and borders between the population, many among the USM's Anarcho-Syndicalists have often championed for working with alternate groups when necessary, this being one of those times.\n\nWhile this may be insignificant in the long term, the leaders of both groups are hoping that if success comes for either the Autonomists or Anarchists in the final discussion of the TUC, the coalition may just be enough for them to grasp victory from the other more dominant factions. Despite the influence of the Anarchists in this alliance, it is expected that the Autonomists will wield the majority of the political power in an attempt to keep the peace in the Union, understanding that the fierce hatred that both the BSP and Maximists have towards the Anarchists may rapidly destabilise the nation further."
uobplaceholder.12.a:0"Will this be enough for them to win?"
uobplaceholder.12.b:0"Prevent this coalition by any means!"

uobplaceholder.13.t:0"The results are in!" #(all separate events bc it makes testing easier/not having one insanely long event with a billion checks, but they all use the same loc excluding the button)
uobplaceholder.13.d:0"With the closure of the TUC and an end to the debates, the votes have been counted and a new leader for the nation has been chosen. A new age for the Union may soon begin; with many hoping the factionalism and infighting that has tainted the nation for years may soon come to an end."
uobplaceholder.13.a:0"Congratulations to comrade Mosley and the Maximists!"
uobplaceholder.14.a:0"Congratulations to comrade Dutt and the BSP!"
uobplaceholder.15.a:0"A surprise victory for the Autonomists!"
uobplaceholder.16.a:0"The Anarchists have been victorious!"
uobplaceholder.17.a:0"Another victory for the Federationists!"
uobplaceholder.18.a:0"The WSPU have won!"

uobplaceholder.1002.t:0"No Clear Winner at the TUC!"
uobplaceholder.1002.d:0"In a rare disaster, the TUC has failed to identify a clear favourite for the new Chairman. With no clear winner many have already started to raise support for the more authoritarian factions to avoid outcomes such as this, with all factions seeming determined to remain independent without the formation of coalitions or alliances only worsening the situation. Foreseen as a potential issue, previously established protocol dictates that the current leadership, that by technicality being the Federationists' Arthur Horner due to the resignation of Philip Snowden, has final decision in the outcome.\n\nWhile it is no surprise, Horner has dictated that the Federationists will continue their tenure. Stating that, by breaking from the expected and choosing leadership outside of his own supporters, the nation would only further destabilise into the mess of infighting and disagreement it has become accustomed to."
uobplaceholder.1002.a:0"Perhaps not the victory they hoped for..."

uobplaceholder.19.t:0"Outrage from the Anarchists!"
uobplaceholder.19.d:0"Forever hateful towards the Union's endless intervention into the people's will and even more hateful to the more authoritarian-leaning members of the Union, a huge number of Anarchists have descended onto the streets of the nation in protest of the new government. Claims that this will be the end of freedom for the Union's people have started a fire among the USM's leaders, with both peaceful and violent resistance emerging in the cities, towns and villages all across Britain. We must act quickly before the violence tears the Union apart."
uobplaceholder.19.a:0"Something must be done, and fast!"

uobplaceholder.20.t:0"Scotland and Wales Declare Independence!"
uobplaceholder.20.d:0"In the chaos that the Anarchists have caused, our forces have been stretched far too thin in battling their attempts to destabilise the government, resulting in the vast majority of our political control over areas of the nation vanishing. Seeing the degrading stability in the nation and the mismanagement of the crisis by [ENG.GetLeader], both Scotland and Wales have declared their independence from the Union! Until this crisis has been solved, there may be little we can do to stop them.\n\nIt seems that our local supporters in Wales have turned on us and given allegiance to a resurgent Glais and his rebel government Cardiff. Surprisingly in the official announcement of their own UDI, Saunders Lewis, head of the WHRA, was present and admitted a begrudging respect for Glais' committent to Welsh autonomy. It appears the two men have put aside their differences and Lewis has pledged allegiance to Glais' Welsh United Front. While Wales lacks foreign benefactors or even recognition, with the entire Welsh political scene allied against us, they could be a stubborn foe.\n\nThe situation in Scotland appears much more unstable, with the Homeland Watch more or less controlling the nation. With this state of open warfare between ourselves and this new Scottish Republic, our enemies have already began flocking to recognize the new nation; there are rumours that MacCormick's authority is contested by the missing Willie Gallacher and an alternative socialist government, though it can't currently be confirmed if these rumours are true. While lacking support, if it manages to oust MacCormick it could appeal to the Algerian regime for support.\n\nThe sitation in England has began to rapidly deteriorate: if the Anarchists manage to fully destabilise the country, who knows what could happen - we must solve this problem before it’s too late!"
uobplaceholder.20.a:0"The Union is no more!"
uobplaceholder.20.b:0"Freedom at last! (Play as Scotland)"
uobplaceholder.20.c:0"Freedom at last! (Play as Wales)"

uobplaceholder.21.t:0"T.E. Lawrence Intervenes!"
uobplaceholder.21.d:0"With our complete failure to contain the Anarchists, T.E. Lawrence along with the backing of vast swathes of the country's military, as well as many militia elements formed in defiance of the previous government, stormed the capital today. Hastily arresting government officials and declaring a state of emergency in the Union, an interim military government has been established while the Anarchists are dealt with. Already, many figures in the USM such as Guy Aldred and Charles Lahr have called off the protest out of fear for the Republican military's training and equipment, the respect that Lawrence wields and for their own self-preservation - though it is expected that many of the ringleaders will face harsh punishment for the damage and instability their have caused already. As the Republican Army's advance begins, a new day may be dawning for the Union."

While widescale damage to both our industries and the population's trust in the government has been left in the wake of this rebellion, it has only shown the state of disrepair that our once great Union has fallen into. Though perhaps this rebellion was not entirely wasteful: using the instability and fear that many felt from the chaos, we may push forward the reforms the nation so desperately needs to ensure a crisis such as this can never occur again on the island we call home."

uobplaceholder.24.t:0"Syndicalist Allies Found?"
uobplaceholder.24.d:0"After a brief investigation to some of the more authoritarian members of our Syndicalists trade union connections, two members have stood out to us. Frank Haxell and Frank Foulkes, both members of the Electrical Trades Union and both men who have a disdain for the stagnating positions they find themselves stuck in, may be promising candidates for influence in the Federationists faction. After a brief contact was made to them outlining our need for support, they have come back with their own terms for this potential alliance.\n\nIn exchange for their political leverage in the nation’s industrial unions, Haxell and Foulkes have both asked that we assist with their current political status both within ETU as well as the broader nation. Frank Foulkes, the older of the two men, has stated he intends on running for the position of the ETU's President and has no interest of political gain outside this trade union. Frank Haxell on the other hand has made it clear to us his ambitions, which are far greater than Foulkes'. Instead of asking for subversive support in an election, Haxell as requested that in exchange for his support, we bring him in as an official member of the Central Council - one wielding much greater influence than his current trade union position.\n\nWhile the plans for this new position will not be made public until after we have secured our rule from the terror of the Anarchists, this is no doubt a blatant violation of the democratic process that many of the trade unions thrive on. These are however, the very same principles that cornered our nation into this state in the first place, ones that we will be sure to change in the coming years of our rule. Should we follow through on these plans and gain a new area of influence and Council Member, or choose to reject them and make do with our own party's already growing power?"
uobplaceholder.24.a:0"Very well - they have our support."

uobplaceholder.25.d:0"After further gathering of information beyond the subtle whispers and rumours heard by low-ranking officers, a full investigation was conducted into the senior command and 'Advisors' of the Republican Army. With this concluded, shocking discoveries were made as to the loyalties of certain individuals, most notably Percy Hobart and a small clique of the named 'Old Guard'. This small clique, made up of many officers of the former British Army that entered an uneasy alliance with Snowden's government after the royal family cowardly fled the country, remained in the Union and thereby destroyed any loyalty that these commanders held to their now-former administration. This did not mean they were automatically loyal to our government however, as it would appear the current chaos had emboldened their desire for a Syndicalism-free Britain.\n\nIn discovering this transgression and the removal of ringleader Hobart, as well as the removal of some more outspoken individuals in the armed forces, this threat of an internal rebellion from some of our Armies most skilled individuals has been put to rest."

As more moderate socialist nations across the world recognise that the Syndicalist revolutions taking place are not merely a temporary moment in history, a slow increase in our nations recognition has begun and allowed us to break free from these chains of isolation."

Our newly reinvigorated strength however, has afforded us the opportunity to reclaim these lands: to at last reunite our island and restore the Union to its former glory. Their armies should be largely weaker than our own, so many officials already agree with this plan for invasion, though some have expectedly contested these ideas."

uobplaceholder.34.d:0 "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour of the Irish option."

Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures.

uobplaceholder.125.d:0 "It has only been a short time since Hobart and the various reactionary cliques gathered around his personage seized power in Britain. In that short time since the coup, the brave men and women of the armed forces have begun restoring a semblance of order, although the new regime is still far from secure. However, the exact brand of order that has begun to be instated differs greatly, from clique to clique. Quite a few have begun 'reinstating the King's Justice,' bringing back the Law and Order of the old UK, still in exile in Canada, preparing for the King's return to our fair isles. Others, especially those who press closer to Hobart, simply instate military order, with no other goal than keeping the streets safe and the factories running. While all know just how tenuous our position is, this growing difference between our various wings is a bigger threat to our rule than even the Syndicalists who still fight for their dead revolution. With this being the case, Hobart has called for a clandestine meeting of the heads of all cliques who sided with us during the coup, to hammer out our issues. The representatives of the 'Windsorite' cliques have made their case quite simply; there is one legitimate government for these isles, and that is the King, and the King alone. While yes, the King may have been forced to flee Britain, he is still the sole figure who can unite these lands again. The leaders of the 'Non-Aligned' cliques most notable among them being Hobart himself, fiercely disagree with the Windsorites whole heartily, denouncing them as cowards. Not rejecting the concept of a Monarchy, they simply wish to see Britain free, from both Syndicalist tyranny and Windsorite cowardice. As the arguments come to an end and voting begins, the future of Britain lies in the balance."

uobplaceholder.500.d:0"The WSPU have always acted as a haven for many feminists within the nation. While generally peaceful, they have often hounded and, occasionally, used violent actions in an attempt to further their goals of varying emancipatory reforms. Despite their regularly aggressive nature, many of the reforms they desire are considerably moderate and not too dissimilar from our own; demands such as improved birth control measures, the worldwide abolishment of capitalism and reduction of poverty and suffering among the nation's poorest. Due to an already warm relation between Ethel Snowden, the wife of former Chairman Philip Snowden, and the WSPU-WFL thanks to her own time as a Suffragette, this alliance should be fairly easy to establish.\n\nIn spite of a number of individuals claiming that the WSPU-WFL's actions, such as bombings and arson, will bring nothing but trouble if we fail to suitably implement the reforms they desire, the vast majority have already welcomed these women of action with open arms. "

uobplaceholder.501.t:0"An Unfortunate Standpoint"
uobplaceholder.501.d:0"In spite of Chairman Joad's commitment to the many forms of Socialist ideal thought his life; being a Syndicalist, Fabian, Guild Socialist and very briefly, a moderate National Syndicalist at varying points in his life, an unfortunate truth has come to light. In a private conversation overheard by a currently anonymous individual, while talking over drinks, it was heard of Joad's long standing belief on the supposed "inferior mind of women". The comments did not end there however, as the individual went on to report of Joad's complete apathy for women and their minds "lack of objectivity", failing to see why any man would wish to enjoy the company of a woman beyond reasons of sexual desire, something he eloquently described as "functional purposes". Believing to stem from his divorce in 1921, this conversation has potentially started a timer on the new Chairman's tenure. If members of the nation's leadership or even worse, the WSPU, were to hear of this, the Chairman may be facing questions that even he is incapable of determining rational answers for."
uobplaceholder.501.a:0"Lets hope this doesn't get out..."

uobplaceholder.502.t:0"The WSPU Retaliate"
uobplaceholder.502.d:0"Disaster has struck with the leaking of private conversations. Joad's less than complementary beliefs regarding women appear to have been unknowingly passed to the press, which have already taken great pleasure in revealing all these secrets to the nation's leaders and workers. As expected, the WSPU have been viciously attacking Joad for these archaic beliefs, stating that no true believer in Socialism would put the female mind below the male. Less expectedly, was the attack on the Chairman's home, which has left it as nothing but a smouldering wreck of ashes and charred wood, no doubt an act of arson by the so-called "Young Hot Bloods" within the WSPU. We must now consider the path forward for the still relatively new Chairman. This incident has already tainted his rule in the eyes of much of the nation, only flaring up many of the inter-factional rivalries that have been simmering below the surface for many years. A simple yet official apology from Joad, in combination with rescinding his remarks and a campaign against the dangers of over-consumption of alcohol, may suffice, though many are demanding that Joad give up the Chairmanship as a result of revealing these supposed "capitalist ideals" of gender inequalities."
uobplaceholder.502.a:0"Allow Joad to stay, but demand a formal apology from of him."
uobplaceholder.502.b:0"He best resign before things get out of hand."

uobplaceholder.503.t:0"To Preach What We Practice"
uobplaceholder.503.d:0"Joad has always been a man of varying political inclinations. While continuing to be a life-long socialist since leaving Oxford University in 1914, his outlook on the political status of the world has varied wildly. Initially declaring himself a Syndicalist, he has gone on to encompass a wide variety of different political beliefs and strains; from Orthodox Syndicalism, Fabianism, a brief albeit short-lived alignment with Oswald Mosley's Maximists to Guild Socialism after taking in the writings of Bernard Shaw, and G.D.H Cole, Joad has continued to ebb and flow between the wildly numerous ideologies that have found a place in the Union. Joad's ever changing hobbies and beliefs have given us the unique opportunity to cultivate a unique type of socialism within the Union, according to whichever we feel is most applicable to our current situation and circumstance.\n\nWe may simply stick with our current brand of Guild Socialism that has proven to be a popular choice among many of Joad's contemporaries. The writings of Cole have often been at the roots of many of the current thinkers in the nation, and maintaining this line will ensure that Joad's somewhat unbalanced and varying thoughts can be grounded in a theory that many themselves once declared their support for.\n\nHowever, this commitment to Cole's writings does not stand as the only relation Joad holds to many of the nation's most well-known thinkers. In 1932, Joad, along with the backing of Author H.G Wells, founded the Federation of Progressive Societies and Individuals with the aim of further advancing the reach of social reforms that had begun in the Union. Members including Bertrand Russell, Vera Brittain, Olaf Stapledon and Leonard Woolf have made it a popular organization among the humanists of the Union.\n\nFurther still, Joad has forever been a lover of nature along with the healing, both spiritual and mental, that the countryside can bring. His devotion to the preservation of the Union's natural spaces and promotion of an agrarian, simpler lifestyle, most notably in his book "Folly Farm" has led to an interesting relation with the nation's ruralists, and the promotion of a more agrarian-focused economy. This belief has even resulted in the Chairman regarding the internal combustion engine as one of the most disastrous inventions man has created.\n\nMost esoterically however, is the interest in the spiritual world that is believed to exist alongside our own. This theory has piqued the interest of thinkers such as Joad and Harry Price, the famous paranormal investigator and ghost hunter, with the Chairman already attempting to bring this theory in line with the nation's socialist ideals."

uobplaceholder.504.t:0"A Worthy Candidate"
uobplaceholder.504.d:0"As the unceremonious exit of Chairman Joad begins, we must hastily decide on a suitable candidate to take the newly vacant position. While some call for one of the more senior members of the trade unions, such as Tom Mann or Arthur Horner, to take his place, many have voiced concerns over the deception that Joad had presented. Thought of as a stalwart socialist; joining the Fabian society early in his life, his belief in the inferiority of women has shown that even the most committed socialists may still hold on to the more archaic ways of the past. This has raised the discussion that, to suit the every changing political landscape we find ourselves in, a Chairman who may be younger than the current, more senior figures, and therefore more suited to life in the modern world"

uobplaceholder.600.t:0"Rapid Changes to the Trade Unions"
uobplaceholder.600.d:0"Only a short time after our victory, we have already began the monumental task of removing many of the weakest elements in the Union's political structure, already assigning elements more loyal to our cause as the leaders of key positions. This has, quite expectedly, angered a large number number of senior officials. The biggest task of this operation is the slow preparation for the replacement of the nation TUC with our own Central Council. While this effort must be done slowly as to not incite a violent resistance to this move, by using the chaos already caused by the Anarchists, we can justify the strengthening of our the nation's central authority. This Central Council will be made up of many of the trade union leaders currently allied to our cause, senior members of the party and any individuals who have contributed greatly to our movements progress."

uobplaceholder.602.t:0"Attempt to Establish Akashvani?"
uobplaceholder.602.d:0"With the struggle for Indian independence being a close issue for many within the party; with Chairman Dutt's father, Romesh Dutt, being a member of a distinguished Bengali Maulika Kayastha family before immigrating to the Union and foreign minister Saklatvala being born in Bombay during the reign of the British Empire, it is no surprise that many have called for an increase in our support to [BHC.GetNameDef]. While direct military intervention cannot be discounted entirely, we cannot deny that this would greatly stretch our logistical capabilities to their limit, especially with the expected intervention of the exiles in Canada and whatever support the Germans can muster. The wise decision it seems, would be to fund infrastructure projects such as Akashvani, literally meaning 'Voice from the sky', to act as a intelligence foothold in the nation for our benefit. By funding the creation of this radio station, we may simultaneously increase our goodwill with the Bharatiyan government through the creation of a new tool they may use for propaganda, as well as improve our capabilities for intercepting any radio communications that the Delhian government may attempt to send or receive - should the offer be sent?"
uobplaceholder.602.a:0"Send the offer - at worst they say no."
uobplaceholder.602.b:0"The funds would be better spent elsewhere."

uobplaceholder.603.t:0"An Offer from [ENG.GetNameDef]"
uobplaceholder.603.d:0"[ENG.GetNameDef]'s government has proposed the creation of a new radio station within our territory. Named 'Akashvani', literally meaning 'Voice from the sky', they have suggested that if we accept, the creation of this radio station would allow for the broadcast new propaganda messages across the border - potentially reducing the Delhian governments desire to wage an open war as well as our own soldiers morale. The only thing that the British government asks for in return, is the use of this radio station to attempt to intercept any signals that the Delhian administration may send out. Should we accept their offer on this matter, or kindly turn them down?"
uobplaceholder.603.a:0"Of course we accept, allies are needed in times like these!"

Citing that he has continued to support the party and its members for little over a decade at this point, even being a delegate for the NUWM at the conference for our own parties founding, Hannington's is a well liked individual among many within the upper Central Council.

uobplaceholder.611.t:0"A Diplomatic Excursion"
uobplaceholder.611.d:0"Born to a Bengali Father, Chairman Dutt has always had a strong affinity for the people and nation of India. With the collapse of the British Raj and the rise of Syndicalism in India, our new-found political position has afforded an opportunity for the Chairman to visit India for the first time in over a decade. While the trip will be confined to the territories of Bharatiya, this may act as an opportunity to further boost diplomatic relations between our two countries. Dutt has been eager to meet many of the high-profile figures in the movement for Indian independence, both before and after the revolution, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel.\n\nWhile many within the Central Council have supported this trip, a small handful have expressed concerns about both the journey to the nation and the tours around it; [BHC.GetNameDef] is by no means a close nation, requiring an extended period of travel which further increases the time that Dutt will be required to spend away from his important duties. The biggest concern, however, is the governments in India and the broader South Asian area opposing [BHC.GetNameDef]'s existence, as if the [BHC.GetAdjective] government were to fall into the hands of an opposing nation, or worst case the British Government in India, there is no doubt that Dutt would not be afforded fair treatment due to our strong support for their current socialist government and fight for independence."
uobplaceholder.611.a:0"Of course he may go! The Committee will manage for the time being."
uobplaceholder.611.b:0"No! What is a nation without its leader?"

uobplaceholder.612.t:0"The Temporary Chairman"
uobplaceholder.612.d:0"In confirming Dutt's trip to [BHC.GetNameDef], a temporary Chairman for the Union will be required. While all three of the potential candidates come from in inner party and follow the party line near perfectly, with all three being founding members of the BSP, Walton Newbold has often been a more moderate voice of the Council, advocating for a marginally less authoritarian version of our current doctrine.\n\nCompared to Newbold, Pollitt and Campbell have both continued to follow the party doctrine to a fault, fully believing in our movement. This adherence is quite expected as both have been key figures in the ideological development of the BSP, though this inflexibility in governing has occasionally worried some members of the party as to how they may respond in new scenarios that the party may not have a pre-defined response to."
uobplaceholder.612.a:0"Harry Pollitt will not deviate from the party line while Dutt is absent."
uobplaceholder.612.b:0"The more moderate Walton Newbold - his geopolitical skills will be useful."
uobplaceholder.612.c:0"John Campbell has always fought for the revolutionary ideal."

uobplaceholder.613.t:0"Palme Dutt Arrives from [ENG.GetNameDef]"
uobplaceholder.613.d:0"Palme Dutt, head of the Central Council and Chairman of [ENG.GetNameDef], has recently arrived in the country. Engaging on a tour for both diplomatic and sentimental reasons over the coming months. Visiting the capital of Calcutta and engaging with various high-profile Socialist figures such as the Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel, this visit from the Union has acted as a nice show of respect for both our nation's peoples. With this visit, morale has been boosted knowing that our struggle for independence has not been forgotten by the European syndicalists, with Dutt showing extra respect to our own culture due to his fathers own Bengali heritage."
uobplaceholder.613.a:0"Always welcome guest!"

uobplaceholder.614.t:0"Dutt Returns from [BHC.GetNameDef]"
uobplaceholder.614.d:0"Chairman Dutt has returned from [BHC.GetNameDef], though this trip has exposed a truth to the Central Council; our interim Chairman, [ENG.GetLeader], is more than capable of governing the nation himself. This criticism is only exemplified by the individual contributions of direct action undertaken by the majority of the Central Council's members compared to Dutt's. Chairman Dutt stands as one of a handful of members who acted as a conscientious objector during the First Weltkreig. Although Comrade Newbold also resisted his call for conscription, he was exempt from service on the basis of medical grounds, a concern that still worries some members of the Council to this day. With Comrade Newbold's medical exemption, both Comrade Pollitt and especially Comrade Campbell, who himself was shot multiple times and now lacks both his feet on account of the gangrene he suffered as a result of his wounds, have criticised Dutt for his lackadaisical action during the First Weltkreig and Revolution.\n\nWith Comrade Pollitt exempt for his skill as a metalworker, Comrade Newbold exempt on medical grounds, and Comrade Campbell being the only one of the four candidates for Chairmanship to have suffered the horrors of war, some within the Council have started claiming Chairman Dutt is a coward who failed to face his duty in both the Weltkreig and Revolution, calling for his removal as Chairman and replacement with [ENG.GetLeader] becoming the new, permanent, Chairman."
uobplaceholder.614.a:0"Dutt's cowardice cannot be ignored. Announce [ENG.GetLeader] as the new Chairman."
uobplaceholder.614.b:0"Dutt has fought for the people in other ways! He stays as Chairman!"

uobplaceholder.615.t:0"The Death of Walton Newbold"
uobplaceholder.615.d:0"Shocking many within the nation today, Chairman Newbold has died unexpectedly. While the cause of his death is still being investigated, many suspect it may have been a heart attack. While a period of national mourning has already begun, politics must continue; we must decide who will take up the task of leading the nation once again."
uobplaceholder.615.a:0"Harry Pollitt, stalwart ideologue, must take over."
uobplaceholder.615.b:0"John Campbell will be a worthy successor."
uobplaceholder.615.c:0"Walter Hannington, economics minister and leader of the NUWM."

uobplaceholder.616.t:0"A New Form of Socialism Emerges"
uobplaceholder.616.d:0"As the relatively new Russian Socialist government establishes itself, we have already seen new ways of implementing socialism and the Leninist ideal that we may not have conceived of ourselves, one of these in particular has caught the attention of many within the Central Council. Referred to as 'Molotovism' and so named after is key thinker Vyacheslav Molotov, current Chairman of [RUS.GetNameDef], Molotovism has garnered the attention of many within our government for its strong emphasis on state centralisation and class dictatorship, even going far enough to share our hatred for the weakness of bourgeois democracy.\n\nForever cautions of losing our own national identify, some have rejected the notion of following the line of another nation's ideology though others, most notably Comrade Pollitt, have aggressively shown their support for taking the same stance as the Russian government who they believe are the "true heirs of socialism", due to the failed Bolshevik revolution that predated our own."
uobplaceholder.616.a:0"We follow the line of Moscow!"
uobplaceholder.616.b:0"No, our interior politics is our own."

uobplaceholder.617.t:0"Expanding the Young Socialist League"
uobplaceholder.617.d:0"Our movement has always understood the importance of youth in a national revolution. The children and young adults of our nation will soon begin to serve as the bedrock of our military, industry and political sectors with ever increasing importance. We must ensure that our influence and doctrine is being adequately taught to these young, bright minds. By passing additional funding to the YSL, we can promote an increase in organisational activities such as speeches, marches, demonstrations and propaganda - effecting both the youth themselves, as well as a subtle influence into the houses of the nation’s civilian population. Though many claim that these funds would be better used on direct military funding, quite correctly stating that the ideological loyalty of our nation's military must take precedence over the youth, this increase in funding may facilitate a quicker transition from the youth organisation to our militaries ranks."
uobplaceholder.617.a:0"The children are the future, grant the funding!"
uobplaceholder.617.b:0"These outspoken voices are correct; reserve the funds for other uses."

uobplaceholder.618.t:0"Chairman Dutt Reportedly Killed in India!"
uobplaceholder.618.d:0"A national tragedy has struck with news received from India. The collapse of the Bharatiyan government and the chaos that ensued has reportedly resulted in the death of Chairman Dutt. While we are still receiving conflicted information and rumours, it appears he failed to arrive to a designated rendezvous point in case this emergency occurred. After a small scouting party was organised by the Bharatiyan army, many of whom volunteered out of respect for the Chairman's commitment to Indian independence, in an attempt to find him, in nearly three days of searching there has been almost no sign of him. Some soldiers have claimed to have found the remnants of his personal escort that was tasked with his defence for the duration of the trip, but with little to no indication to his location or status, many in our government have assumed the worst. The chaos, in combination with his outspoken support of [BHC.GetNameDef] which expectedly lead to a great hatred for him among the non-socialist governments of India, may have overwhelmed his personal guard culminating in the tragedy we now face."
uobplaceholder.618.a:0"The nation mourns this terrible news..."

uobplaceholder.619.t:0"Whispers of Discontent"
uobplaceholder.619.d:0"Already early into our rule, the rooting out of counter revolutionary elements by Percy Glading has highlighted some discrepancies between members of the party. The majority of reports are concentrated towards the Anarchist cells that have disrupted the government, though some reports are pointing to members previously or currently associated with the lesser ideologically loyal groups we control. The majority of these outlying reports point to individuals such as Stafford Cripps, who has often touted a less authoritarian form of communism compared to our own. His popularity has always allowed us to keep an eye on his followers, as many of them concentrate in places that they can more easily be monitored, rather than being disorganised away from our reach. As Cripps has not made direct actions against the government, other than expressing his own opinions, and has continued to support the socialist mission we are on, there is little justification to act against him.\n\nHe and his followers currently occupy a small handful of lower-level positions and offices, mostly around simple organisation of workers and party writings or posters, so pose little threat to our rule as is. The more anxious members of the Central Council have pointed out that these simple positions give the alleged "Hardliners" - those allied with our government who do not completely conform to the party line, a tangible amount of influence among the masses. We are presented with two options; we can simply ignore these rumours as Cripps remains popular any hasty action against him may come with undesirable outcry from his numerous fans. The second option, and while fairly moderate would be effective, would be to remove any of these supposed "Hardliners" from governmental positions, potentially closing a wound before it can fester."
uobplaceholder.619.a:0"Nothing good can come of this. Have them banned from all political positions."
uobplaceholder.619.b:0"Paranoia is no justification to end this alliance, leave them be."

uobplaceholder.620.t:0"Rumours of Activity"
uobplaceholder.620.d:0"In line with the previous reports of Cripps and his followers development of their own strain of Socialism, further claims have been deceived to the Central Council. More serious that previously claimed, these new files suggest that an unofficial organisation has been formed to continue this ideological discussion. The extent and size of this organisation is not yet known, but many suspect that it may have more followers than these relatively brief findings suggest. There is no doubt that Cripps is a major figure within this group, though it is still to be made clear whether he intends to make moves against our rule beyond simply expanding the breadth of the nation's Socialist ways.\n\nThe approaching meeting to restrict the number of members in the Central Council, a move that will not be popular among the lower-ranked figures in the government, is rapidly approaching. For these reasons, we must therefore consider our options carefully. The unknown size of this organisation may hamper our efforts if they are allowed to attend the meeting which would see them expelled from government, though the threat of hastily excluding them before concrete evidence against them can be found is risky. By allowing them in the meeting however, it may be easier to counteract their arguments against the limitations in front of other, more loyal members of government who would see the error in Cripps more liberal form of Socialism. This may threaten our rule if his popularity and charisma are enough to sway members of the council to his side, but this may have already begun behind the scenes if Glading's reports are to be taken as fact."
uobplaceholder.620.a:0"Immediately ban all suspected dissenters from the approaching party meeting!"

uobplaceholder.628.t:0"The Muse of a Lost Lover?"
uobplaceholder.628.d:0"As with any popular leadership, rumours have begun spreading regarding Chairwoman Ross. Though, contrary to many rumours, these are perhaps somewhat complementary. The already beloved song "These Foolish Things", which describes the many aspects of life that remind the singer of a lost lover, has had an even greater surge in fame thanks to the supposed muse for the song being the nation's own Chairwoman. Written by Eric Maschwitz, who often writes under the name 'Holt Marvell' and has already had success with his various screenplays such as 'Invitation to the Waltz' and 'Land Without Music', there have been rumours that Jean Ross was the inspiration for the lyrics. Despite the beliefs of his wife, Maschwitz has gone against this idea and stated that the inspiration was from the "fleeting memories of a young love".\n\nWhile this comment was innocent at first, many have discovered the brief yet passionate relationship the two shared during the late 1920s which has only exemplified the romanticism of the song. Lyrics describing "A tinkling piano in the next apartment" and "candle lights on little corner tables" have conjured images of a romantic time that many feel has passed. These sentimental images of devotion have created an interesting dynamic with Ross' supposedly promiscuous reputation, one that many journalists are so intent on discussing rather than the political and economic plans that she has for the nation, much to the dismay of the Chairwoman. With the Chairwoman being the alleged subject of one of the nation's most enjoyed love songs, it is no surprise that a new perception of her has been created; one much more humanistic, individual and sympathetic, rather than the detached and unfeeling impression that the now overshadowed BSP once developed."

uobplaceholder.629.d:0"Perhaps one of the most peculiar sounds that has been heard on the streets of London recently is the roar of a lion, much to the surprise of many of the cities residence. Chairman Clarke, however, has entertained many within the city with his displays of control over the animal; taking great pride in the theatrics of fearlessly entering the cage of the beast with nought to protect himself with. Not only has Chairman Clarke managed to tame such a furious beast, even including the taming of various breeds of tiger and the charming of snakes in his free time, but has displayed new methods that embrace a more humane strategy in what he calls the "gentling" of the animals. Rather than employing the use of whips and fear, Clarke has shown that techniques devoid of violence can be used to pacify the animal and overcome its instinct to attack on first contact, despite the injury he received himself when entering a injured lions cage at the age of seventeen.\n\nNot only is Clarke an expect in mammalian matters, but has shown a great appreciation for both artistic and historical items, extending his belief in the new potential of both the aesthetic, mental and spiritual growth that the revolution has brought to the nation and its people. Clarke is already considered a great authority within the academic circles of the country, with vast knowledge on animals, art as well as military weaponry and armour, even reportedly being in ownership of Mary Antoinette's snuff box. With a strong appreciation for these cultural elements, Chairman Clarke is already proving himself to be a popular candidate among both the intellectuals and humble workers of the Union."

uobplaceholder.632.t:0"An Unfortunate Image"
uobplaceholder.632.d:0"Perhaps one of the most bizarre bits of journalistic material to occur in the last few decades has circled the nation recently; an image of Chairman Cripps eating a meal. For many years, Cripps continued to suffer from discomfort and pain caused by colitis, with little to no relief. Despite consistent attempts to find treatment, and feeling he had exhausted all options, his brother returned from Tahiti and suggested a diet consisting of raw fruit and vegetables, in combination with the quitting of both smoking and alcohol. Despite his own scepticism, and still continuing to smoke, Cripps willingly agreed and, along with his wife Isobel and daughter Diana, committed himself to this plan, now rigorously following this strict diet for over 5 years. Governmental chefs have already been directed on the preparation of dishes consisting solely of fruits, vegetables and salads to accommodate these somewhat uncommon requirements, even being instructed to encourage other government members to try these alternatives.\n\nRegardless of the wondrous relief that this diet has brought him, this unfortunate image has somehow became a point of ridicule and mockery for the Chairman; with opponents attempting to use this image to paint Cripps as a man incapable for the job of running the Union. Many have brushed this off as nothing more than the tabloid journalism that it is, but a seemingly small number of individuals have actually taken this ridiculous criticism as a true point of contention. This poorly timed image has resulted in claims ranging from how it shows the Chairman's simple-mindedness, a lack of coordination from an unknown illness and even suggesting that the Chairman is uncivilised - all from a photo of a man taking a bite of his lunch. With much of the administration only slightly more than bemused by this image, nothing will come of it beyond a new source of banter among officials, but it has shown the absurd efforts that some journalists will go to just for a chance at reaching the front page."

uobplaceholder.700.d:0"Mary Russell, once known as the Dutchess of Bedford before the revolution, has always been known throughout the Unions political circles as a fascinating woman. Joining the ranks of the Women's Tax Resistance League; a group closely associated with the WSPU, the former Dutchess made a name for herself for both her activism for the emancipation of women as well as her embrace of the less 'ladylike' hobbies of the world that opposed her aristocratic appearance and manner. Becoming one of the first women in the western world to practice jujutsu and even going one step further by, at the age of 63, acquiring a pilot’s license to undertake solo flights - claiming it helped alleviate her tinnitus and earning her nickname of "The Flying Dutchess" in the process; although she light-heartedly claims that she could leave her aristocratic legacy behind and instead be known for the help in the Union. However with her position as our chief of air force, her flights have slowly been replaced with paperwork, meetings and general organisation of our air force. She has now come to us with a request for a temporary break, allowing her to engage in a flight over East Anglia and the North Sea. Despite her eagerness to take to the skies once again, many fear that a spell of bad weather may soon descend over the region and this flight may be a risk, we need only decide to allow this flight or keep her grounded while the weather passes."

uobplaceholder.703.d:0"Despite many in the nation embracing the new Chairwoman’s leadership, there have occasionally been spouts of resistance to the reforms that the WSPU have been making already - something that the veterans of the suffragette movement are all too familiar with. Despite joining the movement in 1906, Edith Garrud had only advertised the benefits of jujutsu and self-defence with little success, with many of the WSPU's members being more interested with burning down buildings and detonating bombs. However, in 1910 then Prime-Minister Asquith backtracked on his promise of a bill to franchise over one million women. In protest to this backstab, a peaceful march was organised with over three hundred attendees, to petition Asquith to follow through on his commitment. This march descended into chaos when both inexperienced police and male bystanders insulted, manhandled and committed violence against our protestors - an event that is now remembered as "Black Friday". Not only was this day a violation of common decency and civility, but a great failure by the government in its role of protecting its citizens; police officers were seen beating women who attempted to enter parliament, before throwing them into the crowds of male onlookers and left without protection.\n\nAfter this horrific incident, Garrud saw a surge in the number of interested members, all of them wishing to be taught basic and, in some cases, more advanced methods of self-defence - even creating a special group known as "the Bodyguard" for defending the movements most well-known members such as Sylvia Pankhurst. With help from her willing and surprisingly enthusiastic husband, Garrud has managed to transform the WSPU into a refined group, allowing its members to stand up and defend themselves despite the physical differences that so many seem to take pleasure in exploiting. This training proved so popular, it has allowed Garrud to go on to become the first female instructor for jujutsu in the nation, with the ownership of her own dojo."

uobplaceholder.704.t:0"The Status of the Trade Unions"
uobplaceholder.704.d:0"Despite our movement now sitting in the guiding position of the nation, we are still at odds with many of the trade unions that make up the country's loose political structure. Many of these unions are still dominated, with almost all General Secretary, Union President and other high-ranking positions, by men - with little room for new leadership to break the already established hierarchy. There has already been much debate as to what approach should be taken in reshaping these bodies to be more equal, as coming into conflict with these vast and influential unions may come at the cost of our own movements popularity.\n\nThe first option, and by far the simplest and safest, is to leave the unions alone. While the number of leadership positions filled by men vastly out numbers the number filled by women, we can hope that with our movement holding the key leadership position of Chairman, the balance may slowly begin to equalise as the efforts we have already made towards equality begin to take effect. This option also ensures that we stay cordial with the General Secretaries and Presidents that currently run their respective unions - with the power they currently wield being one we do not wish to come into hostility and animosity with by removing them from their positions.\n\nThe second approach we may choose to take, and one supported by the vast majority of the WSPU's more moderate and orthodox members, is to reform the requirements for both membership and leadership positions. In doing so, we can encourage for more equal representation as, proven during the first Weltkrieg with the filling of the labour shortages in the fields and factories, women are more than capable of performing the same work as men; there should be no reason these same women cannot run the trade unions.\n\nThe third option, and by far the most radical; opposed by many of both the WSPU's members as well as members of the other factions, is to dismantle and re-establish the unions in their entirety, resulting in new leadership more aligned to our movements goals nationwide. The most vocal advocate of this plan is Christabel Pankhurst and her group of the WSPU's highly militant followers, who believe that the trade unions have done nothing more than hold back the WSPU's activities and progress from the beginning, often criticising the movements devotion to socialist principles and democracy much to the dismay and distrust of the other moderate members. This plan would see the leadership of almost all the unions removed and replaced with both men and women more sympathetic and agreeable to the policies of our movement, a move that we should not take lightly - seen as a highly unorthodox decision out of line with the foundations the WSPU was built on.\n\nWe need now only to decide which approach to take; though many fear that if we follow Christabel's plan and rebuild the unions from the ground up, she may take this as an opportunity to reestablished them in a way to more suit her own goals."

uobplaceholder.705.t:0"Remembering Those Lost"
uobplaceholder.705.d:0"While standing as the Leaders of the Union, the WSPU victory was not without loss and sacrifice. The brutal treatment faced by our members in prison resulted in countless members enduring health issues that no truly free nations would ever inflict upon its people. Our members were unwillingly fed through the use of gags to force the mouth open with a tube then inserted down the victims throat, or even their nose if they resisted more heavily, where food was then rapidly poured into a funnel to the stomach, though this haste and barbarity often resulted in food entering the lungs and often resulting in pneumonia.\n\nMary Jane Clarke was the first of the WSPU members to die, at the relatively young age of forty seven, from the government's torturous force-feedings during her month long imprisonment - dying of a brain haemorrhage and cementing herself as a highly respected and revered figure for her sacrifice, being a beloved figure in the movement for her strength of character and spirit, even before she gave her life for equality.\n\nDespite her aristocratic and well-off childhood, Constance Bulwer-Lytton chose to join the fight, rejecting the comfortable life she could have remained in. After her arrest for simply throwing stones at the car of an MP, she too was forced to undergo a brutal force-feeding not once, but eight times, that left her health near breaking point; suffering a heart attack and multiple strokes, paralysing her in the process. Defying her failing body, she continued to write about her experiences to spread the message of how the government saw those fighting for the right to vote - dying in 1923, just five years after the governments first step towards equality in giving married women over thirty the right to vote.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of all our members, however, is Emily Davidson. In 1913, without consulting other members of the movement, she threw herself in front of the horse of King George V at the Epsom Derby. Though we still cannot understand her intentions, as plans had been made for the rest of her day, implying she did not intend to die, there is no doubt that the flag of the WSPU she carried during the event was meant to be seen by all. Even if her motives are lost to time, women such as Davidson will be immortalised in our nation for years to come for their sacrifice, bravery and commitment to their belief in freedom."

uobplaceholder.706.t:0"Rebirth of the 'Young Hot Bloods'"
uobplaceholder.706.d:0"With their origins long before the revolution, the Young hot bloods have recently been reestablished among members of the party. Originally made up of unmarried women, the Young Hot Bloods - so named for the supposed group of the "more hot blooded members" that would often be seen following Emmeline Pankhurst as described by an unknown journalist, were a clandestine group of suffragettes who willingly undertook "danger duty". This initially secret group of young women took on the task of performing some of the most dangerous and outlandish operations executed by the WSPU during the height of the Suffragette movement and the fight for the right to vote. While many of these attacks were not intended to harm others, with many of them designed to only instil fear in the populace, there is no doubt that the Hot Bloods themselves were at risk when undertaking attacks on unoccupied commuter trains and the bombing of MP's houses. These operations were so effective in their terror that in response, the government established a specialised bomb disposal unit for dealing with their attacks.\n\nWhile many of the original Young Hot Bloods have cooled in their temperament, such as Jessie Stephen, who was once the youngest member of the Glasgow delegation of the WSPU and renowned for the number of successful acid bomb attacks performed on post boxes, it seems that these tales of heroic risk and action have inspired a second wave of Young Hot Bloods. While this reinvigorated fervour has been powerful for our propaganda and its image of action over passivity, it's hoped that this new wave of hot bloods direct their attention towards the betterment of the nation, rather than simply enjoying detonating improvised explosives."

uobplaceholder.707.d:0"While mainland Britain has always been the centre of attention in the early fight for women’s rights, it was far from the only hotbed of activity. Ireland too has seen its fair share of organisations and individuals leading the charge of progress. Figures such as Constance Markievicz upheld a legacy of violent resistance not too dissimilar from our own; finding herself at the forefront of the Easter Rising as a founding member of both Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army, choosing to fighting both the injustice of capitalism and imperialism. Her battles against these two coming as a surprising choice from a woman born into wealth and prestige, with her father being a Anglo-Irish Protestant who benefited greatly under the old regime.\n\nWith the support of Markievicz, members of our own Union have shown their support for Ireland such as Margaret Skinnider. Serving in the same garrison as Markievicz, Skinnider was one of the few women injured on the frontlines of the rebellion, acting first as a smuggler of bombs and explosive making equipment, and later moving to fulfil a multitude of roles such as recon, message running and later becoming a sniper; sometimes dressing up in male clothes to disguise herself from British soldiers. Employing the training she had had at a rifle shooting club previously, Skinnider only ended her activities during the Easter Rising after being shot three times while attempting to cut off a retreating British unit. While all these bullets hit, one only missed her spine by a fraction of an inch - resulting in a mistreatment that required the removal of nearly all the skin on her back and side, only to then develop pneumonia during her recovery.\n\nThese stories of resistance and defiance continue to circulate throughout Ireland as well as Britain, showing, despite the highly tumultuous relationship that Ireland and Britain have had over the centuries, the workers of both nations will continue to support the fight for liberation no matter their nationality or situation."

uobplaceholder.708.d:0"With the opening of more factories, a new wave of female workers have offered up their labour in the production of munitions, this so called wave of "New Gretna Girls" has already shown great efficiency in their work ethic and camaraderie. The original Gretna Girls, named for the largest cordite-producing factory during the First Weltkrieg located near the town of Gretna, distinguished themselves by almost matching the number of their male working counterparts in the factory, something almost unheard of at the time. With almost twelve thousand of the thirty thousand strong workforce at the factory being women, many of whom were under the age of eighteen, the factory produced more cordite than all other munition factories in the nation combined, at 1,400 tonnes per week.\n\nKnown as 'The Devil's Porridge', the production of cordite was highly dangerous both for its chemical production, using substances and materials such as nitric acid, sulphuric acid and nitro-cotton as well as its explosive properties. These dangers resulted in acts of heroism being performed by women such as Euphemia Cunningham, who re-entered the factory despite an explosion risk to find missing workers; only narrowly avoiding an explosion herself that killed one and injured nine more.\n\nThis new storm of Gretna girls and their tales of heroic deeds has proven useful for our propaganda with many workers, a large majority being women, now volunteering to work in munitions factories all across the nation despite the risks they may face."

With her rule all but uncontested, the controversial idea to reclaim the old lands our nation once controlled have presented themselves to us, though we would of course pursue this mission under the guise of liberation and benevolent intervention in the chaos that still grips much of the world. This move may be disliked by many across the nation and hated even more so by the countries that now occupy our former lands, if successful it would no doubt secure our global position for years, if not decades, to come. Should we pursue these ambitions or leave them alone; letting allowing us focus on other domestic matters?"

uobplaceholder.710.d:0"[ENG.GetLeader] has been a member of the WSPU from the very beginning, earning wide praise and respect as a semi-mythical figure in the movement for their continued and ceaseless fight in the struggle for genuine equality between the sexes. While this experience and legacy can be found almost nowhere else in the Union's political groupings, it may soon be time for the current chairwoman's retirement despite the relatively short time she has led for - highlighted by the still recent resignation of Philip Snowden as well as the internal conflicts brought on by Sylvia Pankhurst's autocratic and politically questionable outburst regarding the supposedly tragic loss of the old Empire. Both these recent issues have themselves raised questions regarding the maximum age for leadership roles in the Union and whether it may be time for a younger member of the movement to take the reins and lead a new generation of activists and militants alike, the only decision left to make is if we follow through with these changes, and if so, who - we have narrowed down the potential leaders to three prospective candidates.\n\nThe first of these is Jessie Stephen, a member of the original Young Hot Bloods who committed extensive action in Glasgow in the name of the WSPU, while a diehard feminist, much of her political choosing may see the movement lean more towards Council Communism, a form of governing that was most certainly influenced by her time in the movement due to Sylvia Pankhurst's own admiration for the ideology.\n\nThe second candidate is Barbara Betts, while being a much less experienced member of the WSPU, joining very late in comparison to Jessie Stephen, she has no doubt shown a deep commitment to the movement and its principles, she is expected to continue maintain the political status quo and the legacy that the WSPU has built for itself over its countless years of activism.\n\nThe final candidate, and perhaps the most the controversial and unlikely candidate to be chosen would be Ethel Mannin. Only recently joining the movement after the failure of the Anarchistic United Socialism Movement in the TUC, Mannin has continually voiced her dreams of moving the movement towards a more Anarchistic alignment, seeking to remove any aspect of hierarchy and leadership, instead running the WSPU as a movement where all voices are considered equal, with no one matriarch or council to determine the groups actions."

While this demand is nothing short of complete madness, it is not the first time we have heard this proposal, as an almost identical idea was once echoed in the First Weltkreig by Emmeline Pankhurst with the support of Christabel to rule the WSPU as their own tool for the war effort. In addition to her request for near absolute power, she has made clear her intentions to put a hold to all social development we may desire for the duration of the war, instead believing that any and all resources should be focused on the defeat of our enemies.\n\nHowever it seems that, despite her vocal efforts and small group of supporters, many within the movement are refusing the give up the principles that our nation was founded on.

While Christabel and Adela never got along; with Christabel reportedly saying that "one of Adela is too many", Sylvia has always taken a warmer approach to her sister. This new position that Adela finds herself in has now opened the opportunity for us to mend the wounds and animosity that have been present for almost 25 years, as well as benefit ourselves politically. We must therefore consider an attempt to made contact with the [AST.GetAdjective] government, formally inviting them to our alliance - [AST.GetNameDef] would be a powerful ally in the Pacific after all, regardless of what hostility remains between the two sisters."

uobplaceholder.715.d:0"To little surprise, Chairwoman Christabel's declaration of her complete control of the PSPU's council has proven to be an immensely unpopular move both inside and outside of the party. In replacing the party's council members with her closest supporters who simply act as willing organisers, our ability to effectively make changes in policy has increased exponentially. Despite this hastening, almost all policy changes are met with resistance from the senior members of the old council, who still hold immense respect and influence among huge swathes of the population. The relatively small number of supporters that follow this new militant strain of feminism means that it may be in our best interest to diversify our thinking to appeal to groups outside of the PSPU's currently highly focused manifesto.\n\nThe first and perhaps the most unexpected and extreme group of potential allies we have found lies within the small number of rabid nationalists that remain in the Union. The existence of many of these groups is unknown to the common citizen, but with special political contacts and manoeuvring, we have managed to make contact with many who share a burgeoning nostalgia for the grand empire our nation once held. Many of these individuals are former members of the National Party, a fiercely Germanophobic group that has previously collaborated with Chairwoman Christabel during the First Weltkreig. Despite their opposition to Syndicalism, they have expressed their desire to work with more moderate Socialists in the nation to us, once seeing the now defunct Labour party as "the great party that was coming". It is slowly being revealed that Christabel shares these feelings of destain for orthodox Syndicalism, seeing sweeping economic and political change as a burden to the cause of women's enfranchisement, making this potential alliance all the more important to our power base.\n\nThe alternative option would be an alliance with the Maximists of Oswald Mosley's movement; with Christabel already being a former acquaintance with Norah Elam, leader of the Maximist's women's section. This mutual trust came from her time as a member of the WSPU and brief work with her during the First Weltkreig, in an attempt to garner support for the swift end of the war, not through a treaty or truce, but instead through the rapid defeat of Germany and her allies. With Elam's position in the Maximists, Mosley's existing support for the nation's women and their popularity among the many veterans that served during the First Weltkreig, the Maximists are appearing to be a strong choice.\n\nWe could, however, simply continue our development without an alliance with either of these groups. While this movement may be risky in the short term, it would ensure that the corrupting influence of other politics would not interfere with our current goals and desires for the populace. This would ensure that the mission we have set for ourselves would not be diverted or slowed down by the needs of our allies, instead leaving us with complete autonomy to choose our own path for the Union."

This campaign, informally referred to as the "Intern them all" campaign by its critics for the perceived absurdity it holds, has shown to be surprisingly popular which has had the unfortunate effect of alienating and out casting many of the Eastern Europeans within the Union, betraying the safe haven we have supposedly promised many of the world's workers.\n\nThis rabid anti-German stance we have began to take has encouraged many to go on and discover the works of General Boulanger who held an almost obsessive desire to see the complete and total destruction of Germany as payment for the fall of the Second French Empire. This struggle has been pointed out by many to mirror our own struggle with the fall of the British Empire at the hands of the Kaiser's lackeys and servants.

By far one of the most aggressive advocates for equality is Hugh Franklin, a man who holds an astonishing record for his continued support for our movement regardless of the challenges he has faced. Disowned by his own father for abandoning Judaism in place of agnosticism in 1908 and losing his first wife Elise Duval, herself a member of the WSPU, in part due to the force feedings she suffered at the hands of the old government, Franklin has never relented in his activism. Going go so far as to attack the then Home Secretary Winston Churchill with a whip while insulting him over the treatment of Suffragettes and himself participating in hunger strikes, which resulted in his repeated force feedings in prison. This near-endless commitment to our cause has left him with a recorded 114 force feedings - placing him high in the rankings of the WSPU, MPU and MLWS. This treatment in prison also resulted in the first release under the introduced "Cat and Mouse" law, with the government deciding he was too weak to enture anymore of this torture.\n\nDue to the recent integration of these organisations, many are calling for men such as Hugh Franklin to at last be honoured for their efforts, both in their non-militant and militant actions regardless of their sex. The MPU and MLWS's integration into our movement has brought an out pour of positive attention and praise to the male advocates and activists for equality, but calls are being made for Franklin himself to be made a member of our government; his actions have exceeded those of even some of the most diehard feminists, and it may finally be time to give him the recognition he deserves."

uobplaceholder.812.t:0"The Many Mitford Sisters"
uobplaceholder.812.d:0"In a land once so full of eccentric and well-to-do families, the Mitford family stands as one of the nation’s most diverse and perhaps one of the most confusing. Born in 1878, David Freeman-Mitford, father of the families six well-known sisters and single lesser known son, was renowned for his legendary eccentricity, anger and hatred for any progressive reforms that the old government ever attempted to implement. Despite his aristocratic lifestyle, the second Baron was somewhat infamous for his lack of academic aptitude, happily claiming that he has only ever read a single book in his life - time he would much rather spend in the saddle of a horse. With this hostility of education, reading and social progress extending towards all German, Italian and French peoples after his brief experiences in the First Weltkreig, it is no surprise that upon the revolution's beginnings this bearish man fled to a family-owned gold mine located in Ontario, Canada.\n\nWith such a vulgar man as a father, it is no surprise that much of the family is spread across the political spectrum. While their father fled near instantly at the sign of a socialist uprising, three of the sisters still reside in the Union, despite the quiet protests that some have voiced over members of a high-profile family being allowed to remain. Perhaps the most well-known of the three sisters is Diana, now the wife of Chairman Mosley, after her first marriage collapsed from her husband's insistence on fleeing across the Atlantic, with Diana instead seeing her potential place in this new regime and choosing remaining. Along with her sisters Jessica "Decca" Mitford, who became a devout member of the British Socialist Party after renouncing the privilege that her name once offered, and Nancy Mitford, the oldest of the six siblings who quietly spends her time writing away from the Unions fierce political circles, all three happily live in the Union.\n\nSomewhat unsurprisingly, and much to the dismay of many, Nancy's residence is almost exclusively owed to her sisters relation to Mosley and her own time as a 'Bright young thing', a wide group of young, often aristocratic, Bohemians made up of figures such as her sister Pamela and brother Thomas, Chairman Mosley, writer Eric Blair and hundreds more - even including members of the Windsor family. These 'Bright Young Things', who were joyfully followed by journalists, threw elaborate fancy dress parties and drank their way through the late 1910's and early 1920's alongside the rise of Jazz, before the abrupt end of the gaiety brought on by the revolution.\n\nHowever some siblings stand at the opposite ends of the political spectrum alongside their father. Both Thomas and Unity, better known as "Bobo" to her siblings, have given their full support to the Imperial Unity Party in Canada and are fiercely opposed to any form of Socialism that may encroach on the Canadian shore. Though some doubt the validity of Unity's dedication to this movement: many claim that Unity has only chosen to support the IUP so fiercely in an attempt distinguish herself from the rest of the family. Once known to the rest of her sisters as sensitive and introverted child, to the point she would hide under the dining table if anyone distressed her, this withdrawn nature has been replaced with one of inflammatory fervour and energy."
uobplaceholder.812.a:0"What an odd family..."

uobplaceholder.813.t:0"A Tour of the Nation?"
uobplaceholder.813.d:0"A key aspect of our movement has always been the fiery speeches that the Chairman has given to the masses. Mosley, well known for his fierce oratorical skills, has continued to give speeches where possible, both in person and over the radio despite his ever increasing duties as Chairman. As our administration is now fully cemented, it may be time to undertake an official tour of the nation to see the effects of our work and here the cheers and applause of the nation's workers once more. Despite the suggestions of some that the radio is more than sufficient to transmit Mosley's impassioned speeches to the people, Wilfred Risdon, leader of the Department of Information and devout follower of Mosley has highlighted that the physical aspects of the speeches and rallies; such as the start black uniforms the Biff Boys wear and the gesturing Mosley performs, greatly enhance the effect these speeches have on the people. The decision to go on tour may be the most beneficial to our nation, but a small minority still believe that the radio is more that capable to give the nation the energy that Mosley offers."
uobplaceholder.813.a:0"Absolutely! The Chairman must be heard!"
uobplaceholder.813.b:0"What's the need of a tour when the radio is sufficient?"

uobplaceholder.814.t:0"Chaos on Cable Street!"
uobplaceholder.814.d:0"Just under a month into our tour, and barely finishing the timetabled speeches in London, disaster has struck! In a planned march down Cable street - both as a show of power and a rallying display of organisation, a small cell of Anarchists appeared to have intercepted Mosley procession and have taken this opportunity to attack the Chairman! From the window of an abandoned building, various inflammatory and vulgar terms were yelled at the Chairman and his group of Biff Boy guards, before a hail of assorted objects ranging from dinner plates, candelabras, books and pieces of wood were thrown down from the buildings windows. Critically, one of these objects thrown was a piece of brick, which violently struck the Chairman on the upper side of his head. Along with police who attempted to keep back the crowd that had now become greatly agitated by this attakc, Biff Boys rapidly went to defend Mosley as well as capture the perpetrators of this act. Armed with truncheons, the majority of the attackers have been arrested, though some force was required to subdue them.\n\nIt was feared that, as a great amount of blood was now making its way down the side of his face and head, the Chairman loved by so many would not make it and would instead die surrounded by his supporters and loyal guards. With medical tending being performed on site, we must announce to the nation the status of the man who once saved the Union from the brink of collapse."

uobplaceholder.815.t:0"A Worthy Successor"
uobplaceholder.815.d:0"With the Chairman's tragic and unexpected demise, we must choose a worthy successor to fill the now vacant position. Many are calling for one of Mosley's inner circle to lead as they most closely follow the same vision for the nation that he held. Wilfred Risdon remains the most likely and popular candidate due to being both Mosley's second in command as well as the leader for the Department of Information, which would most likely facilitate a smooth transition in this turbulent time. Other members of the party, such as Norah Elam and John Strachey, have also been raised as potential candidates. The former being the current leader of the parties women's section making her a popular candidate among the nation's many women and a handful of WSPU members, with Elam being a former member herself. Strachey on the other hand, has been noted as a more moderate figure within the party. One not fulling conforming to the party ideology, but still standing a valued and trusted figure among the parties upper echelon."

Following Mosley's ideas of Anglo Exceptionalism, many within the party have proposed we at last liberate the nations and territories of the world that we once controlled. This path towards the Anglosphere would see our Bastion of Maximism expand far across the global, proposing ourselves as the true heirs of the fallen British Empire. While controversial, this decision would allow for the Maximist Revolution to reach the furthest shores and elevate its greatest potential through old Imperial channels. Though many contend this idea on the assumption that we would degrade ourselves to a level of so called "Red Imperialism", only marginally better than the imperialism of Monarchs that the world once new, this Anglospheric liberation would stoke the fire of revolution to a level never before seen in the world's history."

This path, one based on concepts like Nation Europa and Eurafrika, would see our nation take up the mantle of a cohesive, syncretic and Pan-European national movement in order to preserve Western civilization and European multiculturalist perfection. Through ideas of pan-ethnic unity, non-federal total national amalgamation, and European chauvinism, a unified and equal Europe would secure out global position of decades, if not centuries, to come. This collective would stand powerful enough to oppose any nation and protect our people from whatever threats the world may challenge us with."

uobplaceholder.818.t:0 "The Other Half of the Maximist Eurafrican Concept"
uobplaceholder.818.d:0 "As our armies march across the European continent raising the banner of Maximism high in every capital in this now-united bastion of Western Civilization, the Social Union of Europe now rises under Chairman Mosley’s hand, with a new ideological and governmental direction based on his infantile and still-formulating but ingenious ideas culminating in what he has begun to call ‘Europe a Nation’ - taken from the title given to his newest essays and drafts on the subject - that pulls from similar ideas of total European national cohesion like the Eurafrika concept and ‘Nation Europa’. However, with Europe and European North Africa under our domain and now being enlightened with the glories of Maximism, perhaps it is time to put the final pieces of the full Maximist Pan-European dream into place.\n\nBased on concepts first created by his contemporary and friend, the Austrian journalist and amateur Maximist philosopher Anton Zischka, and later expanded by Mosley himself, the rest of the so-called ‘Europe a Nation’ plan theorizes that the Maximist Revolution take up the torch of civilization on the Dark Continent, conquering all of Africa and putting under an apartheid-like puppet state loyal to the Social Union and dedicated primarily to the exploitation of mineral and agricultural resources, scientific development, European settlement, and - if possible - the cultivation of some form of lesser, subordinate African Maximist system dominated by a Maximist vanguardist minority rule where the only true industry in the hands of our loyal Maximist settlers, in order to fuel the creation of a true supranational superpower centered around Europe and dedicated to the preservation of Western Civilization, Pan-European culture and ethno-nationalism, and the creation of a Maximist social utopia for our conglomerated European people, but not the revolutionary sterilized subjugates needed to make our perfect dream a reality. By harvesting, studying, and extracting every last wonder, bounty, and treasure that the African continent holds while keeping its more barbarous inhabitants on a tight leash for the good of all, the Maximist dream of a pure utopia can finally be achieved by Chairman Mosley’s mighty and unmatched hand. The only question that remains is if this long-off goal is worth the coming slog of conquering the untamed, savage, and deadly expanses of the Dark Continent."
uobplaceholder.818.a:0 "We have no need for that godforsaken continent. Leave it to the dogs."
uobplaceholder.818.b:0 "Maximism shall be the torch that illuminates and enlightens the savage Dark Continent!"

uobplaceholder.819.t:0 "The Maximist Gaze Turns East"
uobplaceholder.819.d:0 "Following the unification of all of Europe under the will of Chairman Mosley, many within our government have been wondering where should the vision that shall never be extinguished carry our brave armies next. Although we have already planned to establish our control across the Mediterranean coast of the Near East, a new proposal has been outlined by two loyal men of the Maximist cause. Robert Gordon-Canning, an ardent supporter of Arab nationalism and our agent in the Rif, wider Morocco and Palestine; as well as Harry St John Bridger Philby, a convert to Islam dubbed by Arabic friends as 'Sheikh Abdullah' who also operated in the wider former British Orient; have both beseeched the Chairman to consider the situation on the Peninsula. With the old Empire gone we could redeem their legacy and finally accomplish the goal which the corrupt politicians of yesteryear failed to manifest, fulfilment of the Pan-Arabist dream. What shall Mosley's decision be?"
uobplaceholder.819.a:0 "We have no business there. Leave it to the sheikhs and emirs."

However, despite the fact that we may hold a large bulk of the old Imperial lands, some far-off corners of the fallen Empire that fell out of Anglo control in our absence have slipped through the crack, like the rest of British Africa, the Aden Protectorate, Belize, and other lands afar that have fallen out of loyal Anglo hands. Should we cast off these lost jewels in the British imperial crown as lost causes, or shall we sally forth under the Chairman’s wise rule and continue our conquest until every last inch of the failed British Empire as it existed before its fall following the Great War and our triumphant British Revolution have been reclaimed by rightful Maximist hands?"

uobplaceholder.822.d:0 "After the revolution, the Trade Union Congress was elevated from labour union to the governmental power of the nation. The intention was to create a truly democratic system where for the first time in British history, the workers themselves could rule. However since then the TUC has degenerated into a bureaucratic and corrupt mess of political scheming. It became the new parliament. For this reason Chairman Mosley has decided to rein in the TUC, using his newfound ability to pass legislation allowing for the formation of a National Council. This council will be composed of members elected directly by the people to represent their field of expertise, much like the original goal of the TUC. However these councils will be loyal to the Chairman, they will serve to advise not to broker deals driven for personal gain. All councillors will then personally be approved by Mosley who will accept their democratic victory against their opponents. The TUC has not officially been disbanded, rather reformed into a lower house of government, the TUC will see its influence and political domination destroyed and provided with a new directive. Serve the Chairman."

uobflavourplaceholder.1.d:0"Traditionally a stronghold of Liberals and Tories, Cornwall has continued to be a thorn in the side of the Nation. Lacking any kind of a major urban centre the unionist movement is virtually non-existent, resulting in the government turning to quite unexpected allies in order to secure the county - the Cornish revivalists. Beginning at the dawn of the 20th century, it is the region’s only movement involved with leftist politics in any way. Some detractors claim it is connected to the now defunct Order of the White Rose, a neo-jacobite organisation that existed before the First Weltkrieg, or even the hermetic order of Order Templi Orientis, however those rumours were swiftly, maybe even carelessly, dismissed by the government.\n\nCornish revivalism is first and foremost represented by the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies, and a political group connected to it - Tyr ha Tavas (Land and Language); their efforts are mostly focused around promoting the Cornish language, over time however, they have turned toward the cause of Cornish regionalism and in rare cases, even nationalism. Another organisation important to the movement is Gorsedh Kernow - the Cornish Federation of Bards, to which the overwhelming majority of figures significant to the revival belong. Most recently Cornish Revivalism has gained another prominent advocate - Helena Charles, a notable Christian Socialist and humanitarian involved in charity work in various slums around Britain. Gaining notoriety as a more radical advocate of Cornish home rule, or as some rumours claim independence, even attempting to form a more coherent party to support her aspirations in the process. Revivalists have proven to be reliable allies so far in promoting many of our socialist ideals, but nobody can say what their true plans are for the county and more importantly, how this burgeoning support for Cornish independence will effect the Union in years to come."

uobflavourplaceholder.2.d:0"As the forces of the Third Internationale and Reichspakt clash on the European continent, the British Isles have found themselves at a rather dire problem of food supply. During the Weltkrieg, the Royal Navy remained too large for the Germans to contest openly, and thus the issue never really arose at the time, but now, the Kaiser’s fleet has been more than capable of contesting the Union’s naval forces, and supply of everything from meat to coffee and other goods is becoming increasingly strained. The lack of proper meat products has led to increased rationing from the government of the Union as well as local councils, and this has allowed a strange contender to emerge as an alternative to the more traditional pork and beef. Whale meat is not a central part of the British cuisine in the slightest and while the British took part in the global race to hunt the sea creatures to near extinction, this was mainly for the oil and bones of these leviathans, not their meat. The meat is roughly comparable to that of horse meat in status, not inedible but generally considered taboo or disgusting. However, desperate times have called for desperate measures, as German interception makes even fishing somewhat difficult, and thus, experiments in the use of whale meat have become commonplace.\n\nThere has even been a drive to exclude whale produce from the rationing programs, but unfortunately, it would appear that all these tests and promotions have been for naught. Whale meat emits a very strong stench as it is being prepared, akin to fish, and if it is thawed too slowly, it becomes pulpy and rather difficult to eat. Usual whale dishes would be served almost swimming in gravy and buried under a mountain of vegetables to avoid the telltale smell and the hard texture of the meat, while some innovative souls attempted to create a bacon-like product, quite literally called 'wacon' or 'whacon', as an alternative. None of these have helped fix the issue of the meat being simply too foreign for many to eat, and even cats reportedly avoided it like the plague. Despite many hopeful attempts, it seems to be the case that Britain will have to find a new source of meat for the masses."

uobflavourplaceholder.4.d:0"The Quakers, with their undying commitment to pacifism, have always faced criticism in times of war. Denying any and all attempts to take up arms in the face of potential invasion, there has always been strong discussions over their status during these troubled moments. While some would see them arrested or interned for their objections to conflict, it would appear that new options have gained much more traction over the last few decades, with the advent of mobile ambulance units.\n\nThe Friends' Ambulance Unit, commonly referred to as the FAU, has already begun their efforts to support the nation while maintaining their testimony of peace they they all undertake. Only three days after the outbreak of the First Weltkrieg, Philip Noel-Baker assisted with the organisation for an independent ambulance unit; foreseeing the severely undersized and underquoted units the British Army was fielding at the time. Roughly one month after this initial meeting, the first training camp was established for this new unit and began its work in preparing the men and women for service in the war, without the support of either the British Army or the British Red Cross. The situation changed however, following the collapse of the Belgian army and the Kaiser's march into the lowlands. A party, led by Noel-Baker, was given supplies and were destined for Belgium and arrived unharmed; though a stop was made to assist the crew of a sinking cruiser. After a return trip to Dover, the FAU established its headquarters in Mao les Bains, nearby to Dunkirk where several thousand soldiers lay injured from their time in the trenches.\n\nWith casualties mounting, the FAU was expanded, bringing in many non-Quakers in the process. After giving further assistance across mainland Europe, such as in Italy with their entrance in the war, the Anglo-Italian Ambulance Unit was created to assist with administrative tasks and logistical support. By the latter years of the war, approximately 1360 men and women worked as part of the FAU, driving over a collective two million miles. There is no doubt that the contribution from these pacifist helped save the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers from wartime wounds and injury. With there growing support in our current conflict, our men can feel confident that a friend will always be nearby to treat them when needed."

uobflavourplaceholder.7.d:0"In a age so riddled with instability and fear, the individuals that remain cheerful and smiling in times of strife have been called both indomitable and insane. Beloved by many members in the horse racing scene, the famous tipster Prince Monolulu, whose real name is Peter Carl McKay, has acted as a attention grabbing individual for racegoers since 1903.\n\nOriginally born in the West Indies though claiming to be from Ethiopia, Monolulu arrived in the country in 1902 after an extensive trip which has taken him thousands of miles. From his own accounts, he managed to make his way to the coast of Africa where he was first crimped into a sailing crew by a British vessel. Though doubts are raised as to his supposed shipwrecking on the Portuguese coast, most likely travelling via Puerto Rico, Monolulu ended up in New York city where he held a variety of jobs and eventually made his way to London. The choice to style himself as a Prince came from his crimping, when he had hoped that this claim of royalty would permit him better treatment - though judging by his near endless travels it is yet to be seen if this title made any difference.\n\nRapidly establishing himself as a common figure at the races as a tipster, with his first visit to the Epsom Derby in 1903, Prince Monolulu has become a common and beloved sight to the racegoers - most notably for the bright ostrich feathers he can be seen wearing in his hat and the lion's claw swinging from his neck. Along with the visual spectacle, the catchphrase of "I gotta a horse" signifies to all spectators as to Monolulu's location, assisting in his business as a tipster; providing information on the horses and their jockeys, for a price of course. This business was given a great surge in customers when, in 1920, Monolulu successfully determined that Spion Kop would win - even with the predicted odds of 100-6 massively against this bet. The unexpected success of this win earned Monolulu eight thousand pounds and national prominence as an eccentric who appeared to know what he was doing. After being unfortunate enough to be in Königsberg during the First Weltkrieg's start and therefore being interned for its duration, Monolulu returned to London in 1919 and has remained ever since.\n\nDespite many seeing the Epsom Derby as a relic of aristocratic rule which conjures the scenes of women in petticoats and oversized hats with their pipe-smoking husbands in ill-fitting suits, it has been transformed into a sport for the common man. Prince Monolulu, a colourful character both from appearance and temperament, has only made the races that much more exciting and remains a fan-favourite to this day."

Founded by the organiser of the NUWM, Walter Hannington, often simply referred to as 'Wal', the establishment of the Slough Syndicate marked one of the first moments the old nation began its turn towards the more radical forms of socialist governing, eventually leading to the full establishment of the Syndicalist system we now live to defend. With over five thousand workers, the Slough motor transport depot played an important role in the military campaign during the First Weltkrieg; repairing many of the trucks that had been used for ferrying food and munitions to the front, as well as bringing back the corpses of those left to die.\n\nThis importance however, did not spare its workforce from the ever increasing levels of conscription that the population was facing, inevitably leading to the factories closure in 1920 and the liquidation of all its labourers declared to happen two weeks later. This coming deadline resulted in an explosion of pro-socialist activity among the soon-to-be unemployed men, with the ever nearing threat of being sent to the European slaughterhouse lighting a fire for all involved, with Hannington acting as the chief organiser of the resistance. After the governments hearing of this, two checkpoints were established at both exits of the factory to ensure that no worker was found to be taking property, such as tools, equipment and supplies, that did not belong to them from the premises. The workers rightly resented this move and began to resist the searches - organising themselves into marching formations twelve abreast, to march out the factory unharassed. Expectedly, the police that had been deployed to carry out the searches attempted to resist, but found themselves hopelessly outnumbered by the men, marking one of the first turning points of workers organising amongst one another and successfully overcoming the governments jackboot and baton."

uobflavourplaceholder.15.d:0"A controversial legend has died, far from home, in a team his countrymen would rather forget he was ever a part of. Richard John Beattie Seaman, too young to fight in the Weltkrieg, was born right in time to compete in the thrilling automotive sport scene, competing at home and abroad with a passion many would consider spectacular. Starting his career off swiftly by winning three consecutive times in the Swiss Grand Prix, Seaman was, despite his english background, invited to compete on behalf of Mercedes, something that caused great uproar in his family.\n\n Taking the plunge against the wishes of his mother and wider family, Seaman became increasingly isolated despite winning more and more races, becoming a regular in any scene featuring cars in the later thirties. Sadly, last night it was revealed that Seaman, while competing in Spa, Richard the racer suffered a great fatality. Leading the lap during harsh conditions, he crashed into a tree on the twenty second lap, soon catching fire, later dying of his wounds.\n\nCuriously, upon hearing of the death of the master driver, Crown Prince Wilhelm sent a large wreath to his funeral, something that caused great consternation as he was laid to rest in Putney Vale in London. A legendary driver, some still cannot understand why he went to race for the 'other side', and he takes his secret with him to the grave"

Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades.\n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set.

During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI.

The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

They went further to state that similar attacks would take place until Wales was given its independence from English rule. The organisation has been in active opposition to the government in Westminster since 1925 and due to a lack of industrialisation in the North of Wales very little has been done to integrate the republican heartlands into the wider Union of Britain.

In a bid to buy popularity with the masses via easy propaganda and a manipulation of historical nostalgia, and in an attempt to score a cheap win against Royalism, a small clique of fanatical youth MPs, primarily young Mosleyites, have put forth a public claim to know who the true culprit was.

Originally posed as a suspect by the French writer and dandy aesthete Philippe Simounet, who himself claims to have gotten the information from the famed physician Thomas E. A.

#uobflavour.39.d:0 "As the process of Devolution nears it's completion, a bill has reached the floor of the reformed TUC, calling for the creation of a special union for that section of the populace commonly referred to as the Lumpenproletariat. Also known simply as the 'Lumpen' this portion of the populace, roughly 3-5%, are those who cannot or chose not to work, those who steal to get by, those who panhandle, the poorest of the poor in other words, those whom a more reactionary society would consider not but dirty and lazy degenerates. While the Union of Britain prided itself on its progressive and equal laws, many of those in the TUC and even many simply within the working class, viewed themselves to be greater than the Lumpen. Indeed, in many ways life for the Lumpen is the same under the us and it was under the Reactionaries. Unlike under the reactionaries however, the Lumpen have lost the right to vote. Due to the driving force of the Revolution being Unions, only those workers within Unions legally have the right to vote. With the Lumpen either not having work or not making enough to afford dues, they remain outside a Union, and thus outside the political process. While it is not only the Lumpen who are affected by this, some workers choose to not join a Union, they are the most overwhelmingly affected. Not only this, but due to them not being members in a Union, they are often denied social benefits, although they still have access to much more than they did under the reactionary Windsors. Due to this, and among other factors, many consider the Lumpen to be a breeding ground for reactionary idealism, which does seem to be correct.\n\nThis is where the proposed bill enters the discussion. Due to the growing presence of reactionary elements within the Lumpen, and due to the fact they have been long ignored by the old corrupted TUC, the bill would have a special and due free Union created, especially for the Lumpen. While in reality, the Union would almost function solely as a meeting hall, it would allow a sizeable section of the population to finally have a voice in government. Those who oppose the bill, mostly those outside of the Autonomists, say that by creating such a Union, we would encourage laziness. Why work when you can simply join the Lumpen Union and reap all the benefits of a proper worker? Due to the controversial aspect of the bill, the TUC is almost evenly split. Support or condemnation from the Chairman would surely be enough to break the gridlock, and thus both sides have reached out to the Executive, and Chairman Glais is expected to make an announcement regarding the bill in the coming hours."

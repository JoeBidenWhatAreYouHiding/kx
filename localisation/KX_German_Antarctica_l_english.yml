ANT_expidition_idea:0 "The Third German Antarctic Expedition of 1936"
ANT_expidition_idea_desc:0 "Led by famous polar explorer and captain of the Kaiserliche Marine Alfred Ritscher, the Neuschwabenland Expedition is the Kaiserreich’s third state-funded survey mission into the frozen wastes of Antarctica. Following the success and interest drummed up by the earlier Gauss Expedition of 1903 - which led to the creation of Kaiser Wilhelm II Land within the Antarctic landmass - this third foray into the ‘Bottom of the World’ is primarily concerned with scientific discovery, astronomy, meteorology, hydrology, and land surveying while seeking out new sources of natural minerals and whale oil. However, the expedition also has a secret mission given to Captain Ritscher by the Kaiser himself - to survey suitable locations to possibly establish a covert U-boat base, listening posts, and other military installations. Though this flies in the face of Antarctica neutrality, the ambitions of the Kaiserreich know no bounds."

ANT_alone_idea:0 "’Alone’ at the Bottom of the World"
ANT_alone_idea_desc:0 "Out here in the windswept tundras and blistering ice fields of Antarctica, little can survive. However, despite first appearances and common conceptions, it would seem that we are not alone in this frozen hell. From the uncharacteristically organized penguin colonies that seem to waddle with purpose at the behest of some unknown force or figure to the reported sightings of large beasts or wandering spectres seemingly from other worlds, this continent is the last true untainted and unmolested wilderness on Earth, and out here, Man is far from being the master."

### Focuses ###
ANT_expedition:0 "Exploring Neuschwabenland"
ANT_expedition_desc:0 "On orders of His Majesty the Kaiser, Captain Alfred Ritscher and his band of adventurers, sailors, scientists, and madmen have landed in Antarctica - the frozen bottom of the world. Now, with a basecamp established and a mission given to us by Kaiser Wilhelm, we must survey this new land both for wealth - in knowledge and natural resources - and for the ambitions of our sovereign, for despite Antarctica’s supposed neutrality, we Germans have plans for this frozen wasteland."

ANT_alone_in_the_cold:0 "Alone in the Cold"
ANT_alone_in_the_cold_desc:0 "As we traverse this icy domain, we have yet to come across any other living beings besides the occasional wandering waddle of the penguin colonies or the odd cetacean or pinniped spotted by the men. However, many within our ranks cannot help but feel as though we are being watched - stalked even - by unknown forces or figures. Despite these worries, we know the truth. We must keep our wits about us and ensure to all within our expedition that we are alone here in this frost-covered hell, and the only dangers around us are the terrain and the weather...or at least, so we hope."

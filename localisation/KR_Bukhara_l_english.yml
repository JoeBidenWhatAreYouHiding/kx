POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ALIM_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 3rd, 1880, in Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Emir Sayyid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan is the last ruler of the royal title inherited from Genghis Khan's empire, the Bukhara Emirate. His reign, beginning in 1911, was promising at first - the emir introduced reforms in taxation and administration, and some thought he might be the reformer Bukhara needed to become an independent state again. However, it turned out that his reforms were only aimed at strengthening his power, and reformers who were in the Emirate were expelled or repressed. With the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Bukhara, like its neighboring Khiva, severed ties with the Soviet government and declared its independence. During the conflict they successfully repelled the Bolshevik attack, and helped the neighboring Provisional Government of Fergana finish off their remnants in Tashkent.\n\nAs time passed, the emir was increasingly influenced by the thoughts of Ibrohim Bey, a descendant of the lower strata of the Uzbek tribe who had risen rapidly in the Bukhara army during the Russian Civil War. A talented partisan, Ibrohim Bey was also a religious conservative opposed to the Jadid movement, and the emir seems to sympathize with him."
POLITICS_SHAHMURAD_ALIM_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1910, in Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Emir Shahmurad Alim Khan, the elder son of Sayyid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan, was raised as a warrior, officer and heir apparent. Becoming the new Emir of Bukhara at such young age, Shahmurad, however, is a confident supporter of his father's ideals. An opponent of Jadidism and reform, Shahmurad is looking forward to securing his position as the absolute Emir, who casually listens to some pieces of advice from wise Viziers and officials. There is no doubt that under his rule the Emirate will be secured and consolidated."
POLITICS_IBRAHIM_BEK_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1889, in Koktash kishlak, Hissar Valley, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Muhammad Ibrohim-Bey, son of Chakobay, was born in the village of Koktash in the Hissar Valley and was the youngest son in the family. In this world, between the Bey's fortress and trading rows of Dushambe, in the shadow of the blue mountains, among the villages scattered across the valley and foothills, Ibrohim Bey spent his childhood and youth. Here he attended the Maktab in the Madrasah. He gained fame as a batyr here. Here he was a constant winner in horse races and wrestling.\n\nThis fame allowed him, already at a young age, to form a small band of young fellow villagers and become its kurbashi. However, after his father's death in 1912 he was also granted the official status of a tax collector. His roles as an adventurer and an emir's official were not particularly contradictory. \n\nHowever, it was not his native Bukhara that brought him fame, but his exploits abroad. The most combat-ready part, sent to Kokand to fight Bolshevism were Lokai detachments of Ibrohim Bey, roaming near Samarkand. He destroyed the detachments of invaders who traveled for food, attacked garrisons and seized weapons depots. As a result, his warriors were well armed and the tribal connection made Ibrohim Bey's detachments manageable and relatively disciplined. He had great personal authority and a reputation as a recklessly brave and incredibly successful jigit. Soon his words decided everything at the mujahedin's councils, and the mujahedin themselves began to enjoy the unconditional support of the population.\n\nSoon after the end of the war in Turkestan, Ibrohim Bey became bey of Hissar at the will of the Emir, and later he was awarded the honorary title of Otaliq for the first time since 1906."
POLITICS_ABDULVOHID_BURHONOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 1875, in Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara\n§YPolitical Career:§! Abdulvohid Burhonov, also known as Mirzo Abdulvohid Munzim, is one of the founders of the modernist Jadidist movement in Bukhara, the organization of Young Bukharans. At the beginning of the 20th century he started working to open the first Jadid school in Bukhara. He learned the experience of teaching in New-Method schools from Samarkand jadidists and in 1908, the first Jadid school in Bukhara was finally opened. The school received great feedback from parents of the children, religious figures and officials. The school, however, was closed by the Emir's regime. Soon, together with Sadriddin Ayni, Abdulvohid took part in the establishment of the secret Jadidist society, which promoted progressive democratic ideas among Bukharan intellectuals and enlightened people and fought to awaken the political consciousness of the people.\n\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, the Bukharan Jadidists were divided into the old Jadids, headed by Abdulvohid, and the new Jadids, headed by Fayzulla Hojaev. The main activity of the old Jadids was enlightenment, while the new Jadidis promoted extensive reforms. As a result of the merger of these two groups, the Young Bukhara party was formed, and Abdulvohid was appointed as its chairman. From 1918 he lived in Tashkent, due to the Young Bukharan movement crushed in Bukhara. Today, Abdulvohid is still a leader of the Young Bukhara party, though his influence and authority is far less recognized. The party itself is divided into factions, and Burhonov is still an aristocratic noble by his origins, focused more on the New-Method Madrasahs and enlightenment, rather than management and politics."

bukhara.1.t: "The Stable Rule of Emir"
bukhara.1.d: "In 1917 the Russian Provisional Government recognized the independence of the Emirate of Bukhara. The revolutionary national-democratic movement of the Young Bukharans was suppressed, and Soviet intervention in Central Asia failed. Bukhara became one of the reactionary centers in Central Asia, where the White Guards fled, repressed dissenters, actively rearmed the army. However, fairly soon the civil war in Russia ended, and Bukhara was no longer threatened by external enemies ...\n\nIn the following years, the emirate was more than preoccupied with its own conflicts. The magnificent steppe all too often became a battlefield in which various factions and warlords killed each other. Yet even in the face of constant fighting, one man ruled the country with an iron fist. The year 1936 marks the 25th anniversary of Muhammad Alim Khan's rule in Bukhara, a rule that initially promised radical change and a bright new future - only for Emir to continue the status quo. It would seem that even independence cannot bring change to Bukhara, as it still suffers from the illiteracy, corruption, and weakness that defined the region decades ago. Yet even now, as thousands of refugees try to flee its borders, there are still those who have not lost hope for modernization and entry into a glorious new era."
bukhara.1.a: "Serquyosh hur o'lkam!"

bukhara.2.t: "Russians Withdraw the Capital"
bukhara.2.d: "With the Russian economy descending into chaos and Petrograd exchange closed for a few days, the Russian settlers and capitalists start to withdraw their capital from Bukharan prosperous oasis. The situation is further exacerbated by the rejection of imports from our neighbors and the sharp decline in trade and tax revenues. Trying to sell at a favorable price, entrepreneurs have sharply increased the prices of their products. Legitimately, our ministers called for an immediate price reduction. It is necessary to take the situation under personal control before it is too late."
bukhara.2.a: "Tragedy!"

bukhara.3.t: "Status of the Zakot"
bukhara.3.d: "Zakot, one of the five fillars of Islam, was levied on goods entering and leaving the Emirate for endless years. What is more important, the Russians had better conditions and lower Zakot to pay. As our Qaraulbegi has put it, this situation is an unprecented gesture of goodwill, which should be a subject to change. However, Nizomiddin Urganji, our Qoshbegi, suggests that we should not be so hard on the Russians, since they invested much into our country. Nevertheless, the general Zakot duty will be raised for all commodities, but the question whether the Russians goods should be treated as any other is still unsolved."
bukhara.3.a: "Qoshbegi is right, we should not anger the Russians..."
bukhara.3.b: "The Russian dominance should be over, treat them equally!"

bukhara.4.t: "Bukharan Emirate Raises Zakot"
bukhara.4.d: "With the economic crisis raging on, the economy of Bukhara, heavily dependent on us, is struggling. Today we received information from our ambassador in Bukhara, that the Emirate has raised the Zakot, or Zyaket, on all commodities, including the Russian ones. We would have easily understood their situation right now, if not the circumstances. Negotiated previously, even in Imperial times, the Russians got a lowered duty to pay, because of the agreements between Emirate and us. With the new rules applied by the Emir, the Russians now have to pay the equal amount as other merchants, which is definetely causes unrest from the Russian-owned business in Bukhara. With our hegemony over Bukharan economy now at question, we must reconsider our relations with the Emirate."
bukhara.4.a: "This situation is unprecented! Threaten Bukhara with curtailing subsidies!"
bukhara.4.b: "Besmirch the reputation of their finance minister."

bukhara.5.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Benefits!"
bukhara.5.d: "Upon receiving notification of the changes to the Zakot system, the Russian government became incensed, declaring that we had breached the agreements. Furthermore, the insurrection sparked by Russian businessmen on plantations and factories has prompted the hegemon to demand the reinstatement of the previous regulations and agreements regarding the taxation of Russian goods. Failure to comply with these demands will result in a abrupt cessation of subsidies that have previously supported our budget.\n\nThis matter has also created significant turmoil within the Court, forcing us to once again take sides and deliberate whether we should ultimately sever ties with Russian influence."
bukhara.5.a: "We won't revert any changes!"
bukhara.5.b: "We can't risk our vital ties with Russia."

bukhara.6.t: "Bukhara Refused!"
bukhara.6.d: "The Bukharan Council of Ministers has officially denied our kind and definetely not ultimative demand. With our barter and exchange now in question, the ministers demand to immidiately slow down on any investment in Bukhara"
bukhara.6.a: "Who they think they are?!"

bukhara.7.t: "Bukhara Restores Benefits"
bukhara.7.d: "The Bukharan Emirate has restored the previous benefits for Russian goods and commodities. With our mechants and entrepreneurs happy, we can finally put an end to this crisis."
bukhara.7.a: "Glad they have some sense!"

bukhara.8.t: "Russian Investments End"
bukhara.8.d: "The Russians provided a significant amount of subsidies to Bukhara's budget, which can be considered a blessing for the region. However, for Qaraulbegi and others, it was seen as a payment in exchange for obedience and a means to earn millions of rubles. Regardless, after the increase in Zakot, Russia utilized its administrative resources and stopped supplying investments and funds to the Emirate, clearly aiming to cause the rapidly depleting treasury further distress. The burden on the treasury has significantly increased, and it will be necessary to raise taxes in order to generate sufficient funds for at least some purposes."
bukhara.8.a: "We will be better even without them!"

bukhara.9.t: "Status of Russian-Owned Industry"
bukhara.9.d: "The Russian control the majority of industry, railroads and mines in Bukhara, despite that is not their country. As the Qaraulbegi has stated, every single factory or business in Bukhara shall not only belong to all Bukharan people, but as well be owned by them. With our ties with Russia at a verge of collapse, it would be quite prudent to nationalize Russian production, or better yet, to simply expropriate it."
bukhara.9.a: "Expropriate Russian industry."
bukhara.9.b: "Just increase taxes for them even more."

bukhara.10.t: "Filling the Coffers"
bukhara.10.d: "For the first time since the Civil War, our treasury is facing a sudden emptiness and needs urgent replenishment. However, circumstances are such that it is almost impossible to find finances now, unless one takes this money from the beneficiaries of our economy. The most obvious option here would be to tax foreigners, first and foremost Russian businesses. Qoshbegi, for his part, proposes taxing the elites, promising them the temporary nature of such measures. After all, if the Emir does not want to offend anyone, he can invest the treasury himself out of his own pocket."
bukhara.10.a: "Our elites will pay."
bukhara.10.b: "Emir shall share his own wealth."
bukhara.10.c: "The Russians will pay."

bukhara.11.t: "Ethnic Tensions"
bukhara.11.d: "According to the ethnographic composition, the population of the Bukhara Emirate is divided into two parts, of which the first belonged to the peoples of the Turkic generation, and the second to the peoples of the Iranian generation. Between the Turkic peoples in the first place are the Uzbeks, the dominant people in whose hands power is concentrated. The Uzbeks are divided into clans, living in different parts of the Emirate, and clan origin plays a significant role in their life. The Turkic nationalities also include Turkmens, who are divided into several clans.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned main nationalities of Bukhara Emirate, a small number of Jews, Afghans, Persians, Arabs, Roma, Armenians, and others live in it. The Arabs roam near Wardanzi and are engaged in cattle-raising. The Jews live in the towns and are engaged in crafts and trade, and the Hindus in trade and usury.\n\nIn general, the population of Bukhara Emirate consists of very different, hostile elements, the connecting link of which is, to some extent, religion. Almost the entire population of the Emirate professes Islam, and the Turkic nationalities are exclusively Sunni Muslims, while the Iranian ones, outwardly recognizing the Sunnah, in reality remain ardent Shiites."
bukhara.11.a: "We should reconsider our position towards minorities."

bukhara.12.t: "25th Anniversary of Emir’s Rule"
bukhara.12.d: "Soon Bukhara and a number of other major cities in the Emirate will host celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of Alim Khan's rule. In the cities are expected festivities and festive bazaars, during which dekhkans will be able to honor the power and majesty of the \"Garden of the Universe\", the majestic Bukhara and its Emir, who brought peace and prosperity to these lands."
bukhara.12.a: "We hope that the festivities will go off without a hitch"

bukhara.13.t: "Unrest in Bukhara"
bukhara.13.d: "Today marks the 25th anniversary of His Highness' ascension to the throne, and it commenced in a festive manner. A sumptuous table was laid out for the Emir and his esteemed guests, and there was no indication in the capital city of any impending turmoil.\n\nHowever, as the day progressed and the sun began to set, eyewitness accounts suggest that several opposition leaders arrived from New Bukhara, bringing with them a sense of discontent. They declared the dominance of Russian capitalism, the rampant corruption within governmental circles, and the extravagance of the palace as 'A Feast in Time of Plague'. Their words were soon met with support from the most impoverished segments of the population, who took to smashing bazaars and shouting slogans for reform.\n\nUpon becoming aware of the situation, [ROOT.GetLeader] dispatched his loyal guard and the Mujahideen garrisons to Bukhara with orders to restore order on the streets. However, it was too late. The city had already descended into chaos, and the Jadidist leaders, who had enraged the populace, had vanished. The agitated crowd refused to calm down, demanding that the Emir himself appear before them.\n\nThe royal guards and Mujahideens could not tolerate such insolence from the crowd, and armed clashes erupted, resulting in numerous casualties. A bloodshed on the festival day in the sacred city.\n\nSergei Vissarionovich Chirkov, the Russian Resident, and several Beys close to the Emir urged him to listen to some of the demonstrators' demands and pledge to implement even modest reforms. Otherwise, further bloodshed would be inevitable."
bukhara.13.a: "The manifestation is drowned in blood..."
bukhara.13.b: "Emir issues the Majestic Ordinance of Reform..."

bukhara.14.t: "The Otaliq"
bukhara.14.d: "Otaliq of Bukhara, or the Great Otaliq, is a title that corresponds to the position of Vizier and highest dignitary, traditionally bestowed upon particularly honorable and respected individuals. After our ruling dynasty assumed power, the title of Otaliq, previously denoting an authorized ruler and considered a rank above the Khan, lost significance in the 19th century, yielding to the position of Qoshbegi. In 1887, Astanakul Bey was the last individual to receive the exalted title of Otaliq, carrying it with honor and distinction until his passing in 1906. Thereafter, no one within the emirate held such a position.\n\nIn Bukhara, a country on the brink of chaos, some advisers to the Emir believe that it is essential not only to restore the title of Otaliq, the individual who will guide Bukhara's future and ensure its progress, but that this individual is undoubtedly Qaraulbegi Ibragim Bey. On the other hand, Qoshbegi is convinced that these proposals are merely an attempt at a power grab and that these well-intentioned councils are simply a ploy by Qaraulbegi to remove Qoshbegi from his position."
bukhara.14.a: "The glorious Mujahid Ibrohim bey shall be granted a title of Otaliq."
bukhara.14.b: "We should not restore a good old tradition."

bukhara.15.t: "Violence in New Bukhara!"
bukhara.15.t2: "Emir Killed in Terror Attack!"
bukhara.15.d: "During Emir's visit to Qarshi he stopped in New Bukhara - a growing and urbanizing city to the east of our capital, which is known to be a center of Jadidism and Russian-owned companies. The majority of the area had been under influence of Westernization and Jadidism, who still carry out their deeds and missions underground and out of sight throughout the region. Most of them were rural proletariat and bandits in Emir’s eyes. With our repressions against revolutionaries, they had renewed their propaganda on dehkans, merchants and proletariat.\n\nDuring the Emir's stay in the city, the radicals kept their promises to bring “consequences”, which have taken the form of a massive protest in the city. The Mujahideen struggled to keep the protesters back as they advanced towards the railway station, shouting demands for the Emir to abdicate. The Emir has not yet budged, and still has a force of guards ready to disperse the crowd, by force if necessary. As night broke over the city, the opposition's leaders sent a messenger to Alim Khan, giving the Emir one last chance to abdicate and be spared before the march on the palace began..."
bukhara.15.d2: "During Emir's visit to Qarshi he stopped in New Bukhara - a growing and urbanizing city to the east of our capital, which is known to be a center of Jadidism and Russian-owned companies. The majority of the area had been under influence of Westernization and Jadidism, who still carry out their deeds and missions underground and out of sight throughout the region. Most of them were rural proletariat and bandits in Emir’s eyes. With our repressions against revolutionaries, they had renewed their propaganda on dehkans, merchants and proletariat.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotbed of liberal evil turned out to be too cruel. As the royal motorcade with Emir passed through the main street of the city, there was an explosion... Seconds later, after a rather powerful blast, the citizens were faced with a terrible sight. A burnt-out motorcade, broken windows, and Emir... lying in a pool of his own blood. Before anyone had time to regain their senses, the dehkans, armed with sabers, ran out of the crowd and carried out a lynching of the badly wounded Emir. The carnage began when the Mujahideen swooped in on the terrorists."

bukhara.16.t: "Mecca of Central Asia"
bukhara.16.d: "With the representation of Bukhara as Mecca of Central Asia, thousands of Muslim pilgrims are welcomed in our Garden of the Universe. With a restless flood of people arriving in the Emirate, our coffers are filling with money and Bukhara is slowly recovering from the recent economic turmoils."
bukhara.16.a: "We welcome our Muslim brothers to Bukhara"

bukhara.17.t: "The Future of the Bukharan Tanga"
bukhara.17.d: "The Emirate of Bukhara has been under the financial hegemony of Russia for a long time. Since the late 19th century, our economic development has been closely linked to Russia's monetary policies, beginning with the forced devaluation of the Tanga in 1890.\n\nThe prohibition on minting Tenge without Russian authorization, coupled with limitations on its circulation, have rendered our treasury and markets vulnerable to the fluctuations of the Ruble. Even in the aftermath of the tumultuous events of the Russian Civil War, Russia's continued influence through its Residency and economic policies continues to channel our resources northward. Nonetheless, there is room for change.\n\nThe first proposal put forth by the Vizier of Finance envisions the reintroduction of the Bukharan Tanga as the sole currency, effectively severing ties with the Russian ruble. Such a move would necessitate extensive economic reforms and modernisation, potentially leading to short-term turbulence. However, this decision could have a detrimental impact on our already fragile economic landscape and provoke retaliation from Russia, which continues to exert influence over crucial sectors of our trade and infrastructure. Alternatively, the second option entails linking the value of the tanga to the Ottoman lira, aiming to mitigate our reliance on the ruble and stabilise our currency. Nevertheless, the long-term viability of this approach remains uncertain.\n\nFinally, a third option is available, which would avoid overly antagonizing our Russian counterparts. We could negotiate with Russia regarding the minting of a tenge, while allowing for limited control and collaboration in monetary policy. Such an approach would prevent immediate retaliatory economic measures from [RUS.Capital.GetName] and maintain some stability in our trading relations. However, this course of action would definetely align Bukhara with Russian interests."
bukhara.17.a: "Indepedent monetary policy is absolutely necessary."
bukhara.17.b: "Turn our eyes to the Ottoman Lira."
bukhara.17.c: "Find an agreement with Russians."

bukhara.18.t: "Honoring Sholomo Moussaieeff"
bukhara.18.d: "Bukhara is a busy city, and it's in the narrow streets and bustling bazaars that the legacy of Sholomo Moussaieeff, a revered figure among the Bukharan Jewish community, is most evident. Moussaieeff was born in 1852 and hails from this city, and his life story is one of devotion, enterprise, and unwavering commitment to his faith. As a kid, Moussaieeff got his education from some pretty impressive rabbis. He learned about Jewish law and tradition. He also started making money as a merchant, selling tea and real estate. He was a great businessman and helped the local economy a lot.\n\nMoussaieeff was motivated by his deep religious convictions and in 1888 he made the move to Palestine, becoming one of the pioneers behind the establishment of the Bukharan Jewish neighborhood of Rehovot HaBukharim in Jerusalem. He was a generous man and his philanthropy knew no bounds, as he built apartments for impoverished families and erected synagogues to foster a sense of community and worship. Moussaieeff's stewardship of the Bukharim quarter saw it flourish as a thriving hub of commerce and culture, thanks to the industrious spirit of its Bukharan Jewish inhabitants. Even though the neighborhood is not in its best shape ever since the onset of Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War.\n\nOf course, this story is not a secret to the Bukharan Jews. Today the Bukharan Jewish community is honoring the memory of Sholomo Moussaieeff, a great inspiration and example of resilience. In recognition of his significant contributions, the community is proposing to name a street in Bukhara after him, ensuring that his legacy will be celebrated for generations to come."
bukhara.18.a: "The Bukharan Jews are still Bukharans, even if of different faith."
bukhara.18.b: "Reject their rather strange initiative."

bukhara.19.t: "Russian Residency"
bukhara.19.d: "Initially founded in 1885 to represent the political and economic interests of Russia in Bukhara, the Political Agency by its name was supposed to show the Emir of Bukhara that in the eyes of the Empire he was above the vassal, but below the independent ruler, because the political agency was more than a general consulate, but it was not an embassy in a sovereign state. The political agent was an official representative of the Russian Empire and was in constant communication with the Qoshbegi.\n\nHowever, the political agency gradually turned into an institution, which carried out only colonization measures in relation to the emirate. After the February Revolution, the name was changed to the Russian Residency. Political agent Alexander Miller in March 1917 became the initiator and leader of the project of reforms in the Bukhara Emirate, not violating the status of its political autonomy, but as a result of the suppression of the Young Bukhara in April, he was removed from office. Bukhara was rapidly moving toward independence and the termination of the Residency was a matter of time.\n\nHowever, already in 1921, as a result of the Hissar Accords, relations between the new Russia and Bukhara were restored. One of the conditions of the agreement was the restoration of the Residency, and Sergei Chirkin became the new political agent. The influence of the Residency is far from what it was before 1917, but all communications still go through it, as do issues of an economic nature. "
bukhara.19.a: "Just a spirit of colonialism..."

bukhara.20.t: "Fate of the Russian Residency"
bukhara.20.d: "Today, almost simultaneously, the structures of the Russian Residency in Bukhara and New Bukhara have been closed at the behest of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] authorities. The property has been seized, and the premises sealed.\n\nOf course, this was not a sudden development, as these structures were essentially functioning as Russian embassies. Prior to this, the government had conveyed a diplomatic note to the envoys, informing them of their impending departure from the country. In response, [RUS.GetName] promptly recalled the personnel of the mission, including the political agent and their families."
bukhara.20.d2: "$bukhara.20.d$\n\nNonetheless, not all returned to Russia. According to our sources, Sergey Vissarionovich Chirkin, who has served as a Russian Resident in Bukhara for the past two decades, departed in the exact opposite direction — towards [PER.GetName], obviously seeking the way to find a safe spot for him and his family."
bukhara.20.a: "Russian Residency is over."
bukhara.20.b: "Just an embassy, we should not touch it."

bukhara.21.t: "Bukhara Disbands Russian Residency"
bukhara.21.d: "The Russia Residency, located in Bukhara, which had significant influence on the local Bukharan government has now been completely disbanded. While it acted also as an embassy, we can only see this actions as a threat to a peaceful co-existence between our countries!"
bukhara.21.a: "We have no other choice but to cut all ties!"
bukhara.21.b: "Declare war on these traitorous Uzbeks!"

bukhara.22.t: "Severance of Diplomatic Relations"
bukhara.22.d: "Russian government has condemned our actions and severed all diplomatic relations between our countries!"
bukhara.22.a: "We don't care now."

bukhara.23.t: "Ibrohim Bey's Ambitions"
bukhara.23.d: "Ibrohim Bey, the great jigit who liberated Samarqand from the Bolshevik monsters and thereby earned himself a place at court. But what did he do for Bukhara itself? His warriors, the Lokai from Hissar, are the most experienced and reckless fighters of the Bukhara army, but the ambitions of Ibrohim Bey himself, who became Qaraulbegi and claims to be Otaliq or Qoshbegi, are at least incomprehensible.\n\nThe Emir is under the influence of Ibrohim Bey, but this must be stopped. The reformist wing could lobby for the appointment to the Council of Eshon Babahan ibn Abdulmahijan, a prominent preacher, scholar of theology and jurisprudence. More importantly, he is a supporter of Jadidism, and his influence could be significant on the state of affairs in the Council"
bukhara.23.a: "Appoint Eshon Babakhan to the Council."
bukhara.23.b: "The position of Ibrohim Bey is secured."

bukhara.24.t: "Tajik-Uzbek Tensions"
bukhara.24.d: "Located at the intersection of important trade routes, Bukhara has become a country with a rich culture, mainly Persian, Uzbek and Jewish. Ethnic tensions are quite high here, especially between the Shiite and Sunni populations. Religious intolerance has already led to riots and clashes, as in 1910, when thousands of people were killed in the capital. Now Bukhara is a city with a predominantly Tajik population, despite the predominance of Uzbeks. But the situation is much worse in eastern Bukhara, the western Pamirs and Hissar, where Uzbeks and Tajiks have lived side by side for centuries, and tribal hostility has hardly subsided. The propaganda of \"united Turkestan\" spread by the Jadidists among the rabble has nothing to do with reality, because Turkestan is divided like never before. Nevertheless, it is the so-called \"Turks\" from among the Jadidists who are now spreading moral panic about the alleged repetition of 1910.\n\nOur advisers, in order to reassure the people, recommend taking such a step as appointing the culprit of those tragic events, former Qoshbegi, and now Bey of Ziyovuddin and Hatirchi, back to the Council of Viziers. Ostonaqul, an ethnic Tajik, will be a good example of religious and ethnic tolerance in the state, although the Emir is personally against such an appointment."
bukhara.24.a: "Get out of my sight!"
bukhara.24.b: "We can tolerate him if this calms the Shiites."

bukhara.25.t: "Muslim Unity"
bukhara.25.d: "Muslim brothers should not live in discord, strife, and constant enmity. In our unity is strength, and for our multinational emirate this should be the natural conclusion of all inter-ethnic and religious discord.\n\nBy the Greatest decree of the Emirate, the protection of the population of every confession and ethnicity has become a fact. Now the courts must side with the victim, regardless of his denomination. By achieving internal stability and getting rid of ethnic tensions, we will open the way to the future for Bukhara and its people."
bukhara.25.a: "A great step forward."

bukhara.26.t: "Drafting the Constitution"
bukhara.26.d: "Ever since the Manifesto of April 1917 was stifled in its infancy, the liberal elements in Bukhara have been advocating for the enactment of a constitution aimed at bolstering democratic processes and ensuring fundamental safeguards for the citizens of the Emirate. The Young Bukharans, in their aspirations, had envisioned that with the backing of the liberal government of Russia, they could navigate the passage of the Constitution through the state apparatus. However, with each passing year under the reign of the Emir, these aspirations were gradually fading.\n\nHowever, in the wake of the Majestic Ordinance of Reform, to which the Emir consented at the behest of Russian advisors, work commenced on drafts for the so-called \"Constitution\" in the country. Of course, instead of the God-defying Jadid name, the document would be titled \"The Code of Basic Laws of the State of Bukhara\" heavily influenced by the eponymous legislation of the Russian Empire.\n\nDespite the Court's initial skepticism, the reformists led by Ibrohim Bey aspire to take the lead in drafting this crucial document, which is designed not to grant the Emirate's subjects fundamental rights and liberties, but rather to solidify the Emir's unconditional autocratic power.\n\nThe conflict within the Council of Viziers tasked with drafting this document has intensified, with both the traditionalist Qoshbegi and the reformist Qaraulbegi vying for control over the document and seeking to undermine the influence of their opponents."
bukhara.26.a: "Is this the last hope for Bukhara?"

bukhara.27.t: "The Bloody Night in Bukhara"
bukhara.27.d: "It all began rather quickly and unexpectedly, both for the Emir and for the Qoshbegi. In the morning, a delegation from the Lokai Mujahideen arrived at the palace of the Emir in New Bukhara for an audience. According to their account, it was an urgent matter of national significance, and they presented themselves as messengers from Otaliq Ibrohim Bey. The Emir was alarmed by this development and immediately set out for Bukhara, accompanied by the Qoshbegi who was equally concerned.\n\nA couple of days ago, Bukhara was a calm city when the Emir and the Qoshbegi left. It reminded very little of the January riots that occurred there. Upon their return, they discovered that something serious had happened. Otaliq, with his armed forces, was waiting for them in the Arc.\n\nIbrahim Bey informed the Emir that due to his absence, riots had started in the city initiated by Young Bukharans who demanded a more liberal constitution. Thankfully, Otaliq was present in the capital and managed to restore order. Under his leadership, the uprising was quelled in its early stages and those who instigated the unrest were quickly arrested for treason. Otaliq also criticized the inaction of the Council of Ministers who, in the absence of the Qoshbegi, failed to mobilize city guards to suppress the riots and, instead, hindered the efforts of the Mujahideen in maintaining order.\n\nThe Emir was incensed by what had occurred, and it appears that any need for a \"constitution\" is no longer relevant. He has no intention of relinquishing power, as these God-defiant Jadids demand. The Emir instructed that all work on the Code of Basic Laws cease immediately, and, in fact, granted Otaliq carte blanche. The very next day, the Emir requested that Qoshbegi resign, an offer which obviously could not be declined, and appointed him Bey of Charjui, his native province."
bukhara.27.a: "Koshbegi surmised that all this was but a ruse, yet there was no remedy."

bukhara.28.t: "The End of Reformist Movement"
bukhara.28.d: "The palace guards, acting on the order of Nizomiddin Urganji have seized the moment and couped the reformist council. With a clear aim to destroy 'Jadidist herecy', they have arrested all key reformist ministers and prevented our nation from adoption a liberal Constitution."
bukhara.28.a: "Emir’s reluctance to change will ruin the state."

bukhara.29.t: "The Beyliks of the Emirate"
bukhara.29.d: "The Emirate is divided into seventeen Beyliks, each of which is governed by either a relative of the Emir or a person enjoying his special confidence. Until the late XIX century, there even existed autonomous Shakhdoms within the Emirate, such as Karategin and Darwaz Traditionally, the Beyliks enjoyed considerable autonomy, albeit within the confines of the Emir's policy. However, under the influence of Qoshbegi Nizomiddin Urganji, there was a push towards centralizing power around the Emir and the Council of Ministers. In recent years, the Emirate has seen a decline in autonomy, with corruption becoming rife.\n\nQaraulbegi Ibrohim Bey, hailing from the Lokai tribe of Hissar, expressed concern that this trend would erode the traditional foundation of Bukhara. He warned that it would not only endanger mahalla communities but also increase the burden on an already overburdened bureaucracy that desperately needs decentralization. Therefore, Ibrohim Bey suggested unraveling this intricate web of bureaucracy and initiating a degree of autonomy for the Beyliks — specifically, the restoration of the Karategin and Darvaz Shakhomds. According to him, this would also contribute to more efficient efforts in military modernization.\n\nOf course, Qoshbegi opposes any initiative from Ibrohim Bey, accusing those advocating autonomy in absentia of appeasing Young Bukharans. Nonetheless, he acknowledges the necessity of engaging with the bureaucracy — but with the assistance of Russian experts who, in his view, can establish effective government and enterprise operations."
bukhara.29.a: "Qoshbegi is right."
bukhara.29.b: "Listen to Qaraulbegi's plan."

bukhara.30.t: "The New Qoshbegi"
bukhara.30.d: "The time has come for our mighty Emir to appoint a new Qoshbegi for the Emirate. From two main candidates, Ibrohim-Bey has recently increased his influence in the Court, but whether it will be enough to become 'heir apparent' to the Vizier position is unknown. His main opponent and current Qoshbegi, Nizomiddin Urganji took root in his chair long ago."
bukhara.30.a: "Nizomiddin Urganji has proven his loyalty"
bukhara.30.b: "Ibrohim Bey's talents are in higher demand"

bukhara.31.t: "Ibrohim Bey Returns to Hissar"
bukhara.31.d: "Following Qoshbegi's apparent triumph, Ibrohim Bey was stripped of his exalted positions and effectively dispatched to Hisar Beylik, where he assumed the role of head of that municipality. While it is true that with his departure, it would be unreasonable to anticipate such a formidable leadership from the Bukhara Army, there is also no longer any threat from the radical elements to the council of ministers. Undoubtedly, Ibrohim Bey will demonstrate his prowess on the battlefield, yet his political trajectory is now evidently at an end."
bukhara.31.a: "He won't be missed"

bukhara.32.t: "Revolution in Bukhara"
bukhara.32.d: "There is a rebellion of Jadidists and other dissidents taking place in the Bukhara Emirate, and, according to our information, the previous government does not have full control over western Bukhara, including Charjui city and its environs. It has been proposed to immediately seize the entire valley of the Amu Darya river up to the Afghan border, as not only are these lands inhabited by Turkmen, but also controlling them would allow us to monitor shipping and a crucial railway hub."
bukhara.32.a: "Seize control of Charju immediately!"

bukhara.34.t: "The Otaliq's Conspiracy"
bukhara.34.d: "The most contentious discussions within the Council of Viziers during the process of drafting the fundamental laws of the Emirate centered around the question of who would serve as the head of the government.\n\nTaking advantage of the favor of the Emir, Ibrohim Bey, who had recently been elevated to the position of the Great Otaliq of Bukhara, demanded that the entire Council of Ministers submit to his authority as the highest-ranking dignitary and rightful Vizier of the state. The sudden rise of this fiery and zealous Uzbek leader from the Lokai clan to this influential role threatened to disrupt the carefully crafted and meticulously balanced state apparatus of the Qoshbegi.\n\nThe question at hand is who should be the head of the Council of Ministers and occupying the position of highest dignitary."
bukhara.34.a: "By no doubt, Otaliq's role is only informal."
bukhara.34.b: "Otaliq's argument is persuasive enough to concede that he is correct."

bukhara.36.t: "The Bukharan Constitution, Part 2"
bukhara.36.d: "Chapter Four (Articles 44–47) concerns the relationship of the Emirate to the various religions professed by its subjects. The Sunni Islamic faith is declared the exalted state religion, and the Emir is required to profess that religion. Those practicing other denominations of Islam, as well as Jews, Christians, and heathens, are promised religious liberty.\n\nChapter Five (Articles 48–58) concerns the rights and obligations of male Turkestani citizens. Citizens are guaranteed protection from arbitrary arrest and illegal search and seizure, guaranteed a limited right to travel and the right to own private property, freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and freedom of religion. Military service and the payment of taxes is mandatory for all male subjects.\n\nChapter Six (Articles 59–68) concerns the promulgation of laws. Article 55 requires the approval of the Emir, the Council of Ministers, and the Communal Majlis for all laws, while Article 56 permits the Emir and his cabinet to issue binding decrees when the Majlis is not meeting, though these decrees lose their validity if not approved by the Majlis within a year of their introduction. The Emir is prohibited from using decrees to change the Constitution.\n\nChapter Seven (Articles 69–87) regulates the operation of the Majlis (Council of Ministers and Communal Council). Both are required to meet at least once each year. The Emir may appoint up to one-half of the Council of Ministers, while members of the Communal Council are elected for a five-year term using a system of indirect voting where local divisions of five-hundred to eight-hundred male citizens nominate a delegate to vote on their behalf. Both houses possessed the right to propose legislation, save for amendments to the constitution which can only be proposed by the Emir. The budgetary powers invested in the Council of Ministers cannot be used to refuse requests of funding or manpower from the Army without the approval of the Emir. Only the Emir can remove members of the Council of Ministers, and regulations, instructions, and orders from this body cannot contradict existing law."
bukhara.36.d2: "Chapter Three (Articles 51-54) delves into the Emirate's stance on the religious diversity among its subjects. The highest state religion is declared to be Sunni Islam, with the Emir being obligated to practice it.\n\nIn Chapter Four (Articles 55-61) the rights and responsibilities of male citizens in Bukhara are explored. Citizens are afforded protection against arbitrary arrest, illegal searches and seizures, and they enjoy limited freedom of movement and the right to own personal property. However, in times of emergency, the Emir can temporarily suspend these rights for individuals suspected of supporting revolutionary activities. Military service is mandatory for all males, and taxation is also imposed on all subjects.\n\nChapter Five (Articles 62-70) governs the operations of the Cabinet of Ministers and legislative processes. The Emir has the authority to directly appoint up to one-half of the members of the Cabinet, while the remaining half is selected by Beys, Ulemma, and local Diwan-Beys.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers is empowered to propose legislation, which must be subsequently approved by both the Emir and his Otaliq. The Emir retains the prerogative to issue executive edicts, albeit those amendments to the Constitution require the endorsement of the Cabinet. Otaliq, in turn, is vested with the fiscal authority to allocate resources for the maintenance and expansion of the military as deemed necessary."
bukhara.36.a: "To a pious and stable future under the Qoshbegi!"
bukhara.36.b: "To a pious and stable future under the Otaliq!"


bukhara.38.t: "The Liberation of Bukhara"
bukhara.38.d: "It transpired that the revolutionaries could only resort to acts of terror and clumsy ambushes. They were incapable of confronting their adversaries head-on. Following the capture of Qarshi, the defences of the Young Bukharans, if they ever existed, crumbled. The Mujahideen forces marched victoriously towards Bukhara, restoring order, and managed to seize the city with minimal resistance — without encountering a single leader of the corrupt organisation within its walls.\n\nThe liberation of New Bukhara proved slightly more challenging, with the proletarian populace staging strikes. However, a few gunshots were all it took for the crowd to disperse, resulting in the city's swift fall.\n\nOrder is being restored in Bukhara, and while we have failed to apprehend the Young Bukharan insurgents, the revolt has been completely quelled, and it is unlikely that they will find the opportunity to launch another coup. Nonetheless, the struggle against the revolutionary factions will escalate significantly, and we shall not be taken by surprise this time."
bukhara.38.a: "Long live [ROOT.GetLeader]!"

bukhara.39.t: "Sadriddin Ayni's Execution"
bukhara.39.d: "As tensions continue to rise within the Emirate of Bukhara, the ruling authorities have stepped up their crackdown on dissenting voices and perceived threats to their power. In the latest wave of repressions, one of the most prominent figures of the Jadidist movement, Sadriddin Ayni, has fallen victim to the regime's ruthless measures.\n\nAyni was known for being outspoken about reform and social justice. He rose to prominence as a leading voice among the Jadidists and a key figure within the Young Bukhara movement. His literary works, which were often critical of the Emir's autocratic rule and championing the ideals of modernization and progress, earned him widespread admiration and support among the people. However, the Emir's regime saw Ayni's influence as a threat to their traditional authority and tried to silence him and his followers. In a quick and secret trial, Ayni was accused of sedition, conspiracy against the state, and spreading subversive ideas. In a chilling display of state brutality, Sadriddin Ayni was executed by hanging."
bukhara.39.a: "The repressions intensify"

bukhara.40.t: "Radical Wing of Young Bukhara"
bukhara.40.d: "The killing of Sadriddin Ayni has caused a huge outcry among the Young Bukhara movement. Many members were outraged by the brutal repression and the continued tyranny of the Emir's regime. After Ayni was killed, the socialist wing of the Young Bukhara movement, led by Fayzulla Hojaev, took advantage of the growing discontent to try to influence the party. With all this radicalism going on, tensions within the Young Bukhara movement have reached a boiling point. Former leader Abdulvohid Burhonov, who wanted to take a more moderate approach to reform, is being pushed out of the Central Committee of the party. He's been under pressure from the socialist faction, and he's finally agreed to step down from his leadership position, handing over power to Hojaev and his allies.\n\nNow, under Hojaev's leadership, the party vows to intensify its struggle against the oppressive Emir's regime and promise to lead a people's revolution against tyranny."
bukhara.40.a: "Turmoil in the serpent's bundle"

bukhara.41.t: "Constitution of Bukhara"
bukhara.41.d: "The dark ages have ended and Bukhara emerges from the shadows a new and modern state! The source of authority will now be people of our fine lands. People of different religions, political views, ethnicities, and cultures shall all be united under one single banner - the flag of Bukhara. This is a monumental and historic step for our people and our hallowed states towards the future and modernity!."
bukhara.41.a: "We the People have the say, finally."

bukhara.42.t: "The Question of Electoral Alternatives"
bukhara.42.d: "While Young Bukhara currently remains the only operating party in the country, its leaders are divided and insist that the new, democratic Bukhara, will be far from one-party state. On the left, there are Pan-Turkists, led by Usmon Hoja - a socialist wing, closely associated with the ERK party of Turkestan. On the right, there are Moderates, led by Sadriddin Ayni, while still radically Jadidists, they put more emphasis on the capitalist and market mechanisms, than their counterparts in the center, the Progressives, as Abdulvohid Burhonov calls themselves."
bukhara.42.a: "People will vote for candidates, rather than parties."

bukhara.46.t: "The All-Bukharan Majlis"
bukhara.46.d: "Today, for the first time in history, a free and democratic parliament of Bukhara is being convened. The elections are over and finally the nation has elected its first Majlis."
bukhara.46.a: "Pan-Turkists gain the upper hand."
bukhara.46.b: "Progressives win a landslide victory."
bukhara.46.c: "Moderates win by a narrow margin."

bukhara.47.t: "The [GetYear] [ROOT.GetAdjective] Elections"
bukhara.47.d: "With the term of the first All-Bukharan Majlis coming to an end, it is time to elect a new parliament. "
bukhara.47.a: "Moderate Progressives win a landslide victory."
bukhara.47.b: "Nationalists managed to seize the initiative"

bukhara.48.t: "New Face Among Opposition"
bukhara.48.d: "With the unification of Turkestan, the “Young Bukhara” movement took power into its own hands. For most former Turkestan democrats, the regime now only resembles democracy. As the power of “Young Bukhara” spreads, so does the influence and authority of Bukhara merchants and businessmen. This is why opposition to our rule has finally emerged. Led by Vali Qayum, a young Uzbek in his 30s, the new movement is gathering supporters throughout Turkestan. It seems like the movement has received a lot of support from Mustafa Shokai, the former president of Turkestan, who has also joined the movement and is said to be a close associate of Vali Qayum. Vali Qayum also says his movement is nationalist, pan-Turkist, and follows Mustafa Shokay's ideas. Some think the movement is just a way for Shokay to get back in power."
bukhara.48.a: "Shokayite Pan-Turkists?!"

bukhara.49.t: "Socialist Party of Bukhara"
bukhara.49.d: "With our country slowly turning to a democratic republic, the left wing of the Young Bukhara party, led by Fayzulla Hojaev, has been criticizing our government for moderate reforms and not decisive fight against Beks and Mullahs. Rallying the Dehkans behind him, the socialists of Hojaev, have decided to proclaim their own party, as they have no significant voice among the Young Bukharans. The new party, receiving name of Socialist Party of Bukhara, plans to participate in the next elections."
bukhara.49.a: "A new party with old faces."

bukhara.50.t: "Emir Killed in Terror Attack!"
bukhara.50.d: "During Emir's visit to Karshi he stopped in New Bukhara - a growing and urbanizing city to the east of our capital, which is known to be a center of Jadidism and Russian-owned companies. The majority of the area had been under influence of Westernization and Jadidists, who still carry out their deeds and missions underground and out of sight throughout the region. Most of them were rural proletariat and bandits in Emir’s eyes. With our repressions against Jadidists, they had renewed their propaganda on dehkans, merchants and proletariat.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotbed of liberal evil turned out to be too cruel. As the royal motorcade with Emir passed through the main street of the city, there was an explosion...\n\nSeconds later, after a rather powerful blast, the citizens were faced with a terrible sight. A burnt-out motorcade, broken windows, and Emir... lying in a pool of his own blood. Before anyone had time to regain their senses, the dehqan, armed with sabers, ran out of the crowd and carried out a lynching of the badly wounded Emir. The carnage began when the Mujahideen swooped in on the terrorists. This day will go down in history forever - instead of his murdered father his successor immediately ascended the throne of Bukhara, the Crown Prince Shahmurad Alim Khan"
bukhara.50.a: "The Emir's death sparkled great instability in the country!"

bukhara.51.t: "New Bukhara Seized by Revolutionaries!"
bukhara.51.d: "The Young Bukharan brigands have established a foothold in New Bukhara, and in the absence of our authority in the capital, there has been unrest in some parts of the noble city. The Young Bukharan revolutionaries have gathered a militia of rebellious Dehkans and discontented proletarians, capturing our most prosperous city. We must respond swiftly and with great strength to suppress these brigands who continue to destabilise our country.\n\nHowever, this will not be an easy task due to the current circumstances. Currently, all of Eastern Bukhara is under our control, including Qarshi, the largest oasis, and the Pamir ranges. We must prepare to defend Karshi, as the revolutionaries are already preparing their forces for an offensive. Nonetheless, the mujahideen in the Pamirs, fighting on our side, suggest retreating into the mountains, believing that the Young Bukarians are attempting to lure us into the open and defeat us.. In any case, it is imperative to make a decision in favour of suppressing the nascent revolutionaries before they grow too powerful."
bukhara.51.a: "Protect Qarshi."
bukhara.51.b: "Listen to the Kurbashi and flee to the Pamirs."

bukhara.52.t: "Socialists Captured Qarshi"
bukhara.52.d: "The latest intelligence that has come to hand is that all the western Beyliks have fallen under the sway of the Young Bukharans. In the capital of the Emirate, the revolutionaries are already flying new banners, celebrating our demise. Almost all railways in Bukhara have also come under the control of the revolution. Despite appearances of disarray, their forces are not yet as professional as those of our loyal mujahideen. By withdrawing from Qarshi, we have effectively ceded the city to them without a fight, but it has allowed us to establish a stronghold in the mountainous valleys, where our support is strongest."
bukhara.52.a: "Prepare for guerrilla warfare in the valleys, while we prepare our army."
bukhara.52.b: "Do not wait — attack these timorous individuals and mete out harsh retribution."

bukhara.53.t: "The Struggle for Qarshi"
bukhara.53.d: "Regrettably, our efforts proved insufficient to safeguard Qarshi against the insurgents. Our troops were expelled from the city, with many of the mujahideen unable to withstand the determined Dehkans. Moreover, a significant number of city guardsmen defected to the side of the rebels, rendering our forces disheartened and depleted. We were compelled to retreat into the mountainous terrain."
bukhara.53.a: "Fall back to protect Pamir."

bukhara.54.t: "Proclamation of the Republic!"
bukhara.54.t2: "Intervention of the British!"
bukhara.54.d: "Following the defeat of the mujahideen at Qarshi, remnants of their forces scattered across the rugged valleys of the Pamir mountains, ultimately concentrating near the Afghan border. Due to Young Bukharans' ability to somewhat organize their insurgent forces and establish active contacts with Tajik communities in the region, the revolutionaries quickly gained control over the Hisar Valley — the birthplace of Ibrohim Bey.\n\nThe Lokais, along with other local Kurbashi, were compelled to retreat to the Afghan border, leaving most of the former emirate under our control. In the capital of Bukhara, a republic was officially proclaimed, marking the end of the tyrannical emir who had subjected his people to years of oppression."
bukhara.54.d2: "Following the defeat of the mujahideen near Qarshi, what remained of their forces scattered across the rugged valleys of the Pamirs, eventually consolidating near the Afghan border. It would appear that the revolutionaries have triumphed, but this was not the case!\n\nNonetheless, the situation was not as straightforward for the newly established socialist government. The British Mission, which initially observed events with neutrality, chose to intervene. Their colonial forces, supported from Afghanistan, crossed the Amu Darya River to assist their counterparts stationed in Bukhara before the Young Bukharans could arrive. Wilfrid Malleson, a prominent general during the Ashgabat Campaign during the Russian Civil War and the head of the British Mission, liberated one city after another until, after minor urban skirmishes in Bukhara, he seized the sacred capital of the Emirate. The British declared their temporary control until stability was restored."
bukhara.54.a: "Glory to the Revolution!"
bukhara.54.b: "Let us hope their control will be really temporary."

bukhara.55.t: "Socialists Crushed in Qarshi"
bukhara.55.d: "It was a grave miscalculation on the part of the Young Bukharans to attempt to confront the well-equipped Mujahideen force. Under the capable leadership of [ROOT.GetLeader], we were successful in repelling their aggressive assault on Qarshi. The terrified dehkans retreated, and our commander has already declared a triumphant march towards Bukhara.."
bukhara.55.a: "They fled the pit like rats."

bukhara.57.t: "The Bukharan Communist Party"
bukhara.57.d: "Once, the Communists of Bukhara were part of the Jadidist movement and belonged to the Young Bukharans, but with the failure of the revolution in Bukhara, some of the members, led by A. Yakubov, split and organized the Communist Party - in hope that the Red Army will soon liberate their homeland from greedy Emir. While the Communists were also in exile in Turkestan, our contacts with them were very much limited. With the establishment of a new, socialist republic, Communists are trying to actively participate in the governance on all levels.\n\nSome members of our party believe that Communists should have no voice at all in our state as they tried to betray the revolution and become subjects of the Red Army."
bukhara.57.a: "Invite them into the government!"
bukhara.57.b: "They are traitors of our independence!"

bukhara.58.t: "Usmon Hoja's Pan-Turkist Faction"
bukhara.58.d: "Once a significant leader of the Revolutionary wing of Young Bukhara, Usmon Hoja is closely cooperating with the ERK Central Committee and is a Pan-Turkist socialist. On the other hand, Fayzulla Hojaev is closely aligned to the ERK opposition, mainly RevCom leaders, such as Nazir Toraqulov. Some believe that Usmon Hoja's faction of our party is under-represented in the government, and his goals are more aligned with ours."
bukhara.58.a: "Our final goal is to unite Turkestan!"
bukhara.58.b: "We should not rely on opposition to our rule."

bukhara.59.t: "The Council of People's Nazirs"
bukhara.59.d: "Soon after the revolution, a provisional committee was established to navigate the state affairs. Today, finally, this provisional committee was dissolved and the new socialist government finally formed. Receiving the name of the Council of People's Nazirs, the ministers will work tirelessly to make Bukhara a truly socialist nation."
bukhara.59.a: "Finally, a stable government!"

bukhara.60.t: "Socialist Constitution"
bukhara.60.d: "After weeks of drafts, negotiations and public discussions, the Council of People's Nazirs has finalized its work on the new Constitution of Bukhara. Finally, working people of our country will have their rights and duties written down and respected by the law."
bukhara.60.a: "For the liberated Dehkans of Bukhara!"

bukhara.61.t: "Nationalization of Cattle"
bukhara.61.d: "One of the most important questions in such country as Bukhara is the nationalization of cattle. According to our economists, the cattle should be owned by all people of our state, and therefore, nationalized. However, this could lead to an unrest of more wealthy dehkans, who have the cattle for food and survival. Perhaps, we should not take away cattle from our people and allow private ownership of bovine animals."
bukhara.61.a: "We need this for our state's survival."
bukhara.61.b: "We can't deprive our peasants from their sources of food"

bukhara.62.t: "The Emir Is Dead!"
bukhara.62.t.republic: "Exiled Emir Is Dead"
bukhara.62.d: "Sayyid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan, the Emir of Bukhara and grand Head of State of the Islamic Federation of Turkestan, has passed away today due to natural causes. The Emir's son, Crown Prince Shahmurad will inherit his father's position."
bukhara.62.d.republic: "Sayyid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan, the former Emir of Bukhara, has passed away today due to natural causes."
bukhara.62.a: "Crown Prince Shahmurad assumes power."
bukhara.62.b: "This tyran won't be ever missed!"

bukhara.63.t: "Military Mission in Bukhara?"
bukhara.63.d: "With our conquest of Afghanistan, we opened a new round of the Great Game. On the other side of the Panj and Amu Darya, lies the Bukharan State, which, according to our intelligence, has recently kicked all the Russian capitalists out, nationalizing their resources and cutting ties with the Bear in the North. \n\nIn 1918 a British military mission was sent to the Trans-Caspian region with the task of organizing resistance to the expected German-Turkish offensive after the fall of Baku. On August 19, 1918, a formal agreement was concluded with the Trans-Caspian Provisional Government, which helped in the organization of the armed forces, the so-called Turkestan Army. Shortly thereafter, the mission moved to Ashkhabad, where it remained until the beginning of the Afghan war. However, the mission soon had to be terminated. The mission was commanded by Major General Wilfrid Malleson, head of British intelligence in India, retired since 1920.\n\nNow, the retired general appealed directly to the King and the House of Princes to lead a new mission to Turkestan, to troubled Bukhara, where revolutionary events were brewing to take control of the country. Despite his offer, a final decision had not yet been made, for the Canadian government was now concentrating on preparations for a landing in the British Isles, and to compete with Russia for power over the region might not be in the interests of the Crown and the Empire."
bukhara.63.a: "Mission approved. The Great Game is renewed."
bukhara.63.b: "Reject these plans. Is Malleson crazy?"

bukhara.64.t: "British Military Mission?"
bukhara.64.d: "With the British conquest of Afghanistan, the Entente was firmly entrenched in the region, and now, the governments of the Empire and India formally offered assistance to us as well.\n\nHeaded by Wilfrid Malleson, of Ashgabat fame in 1918, the British mission would include primarily military assistance, but the Crown was prepared to consider economic assistance as well, if necessary. Obviously, if we agree, we will anger Russia, but, on the other hand, we will receive reliable protection against its aggression."
bukhara.64.a: "That's a great idea."
bukhara.64.b: "We'd better maintain our neutrality."

bukhara.65.t: "Success of Mission to Bukhara"
bukhara.65.d: "The Bukharan government has willingly accepted our terms and allowed its mission on their territory."
bukhara.65.a: "God Save the King!"

bukhara.66.t: "Failure of the Negotiations"
bukhara.66.d: "Unfortunately, the Bukharan government has rejected our terms and it seems that our interest in Turkestan will eventually end forever."
bukhara.66.a: "Fools gonna be eaten by the Russians!"

bukhara.67.t: "The Viceroyalty"
bukhara.67.d: "In order to establish peace and order in the state of Bukhara, the British military mission has intervened. At the conference in Delhi it was decided that Bukhara should become a viceroyalty of the British Crown. Among the colonial government there was no doubt that Wilfrid Malleson should lead the new state, and represent the Crown in all affairs."
bukhara.67.a: "Malleson becomes the 1st Viceroy of Bukhara"

bukhara.68.t: "Ibrohim Bey and the Mujahideen"
bukhara.68.d: "Ibrohim Bey, a great warrior, and a former Qaraulbegi in Emir's government, is a person of great influence among the locals. He lost some of his loyal men and reputation after the unsuccessful fight against the local 'Bolsheviks', but he'd better be on our side. Despite his growing ambitions, he's still a men of the people, most importantly, the local people of Hissar - the Lokai tribes. As the great law of politics say - Divide and Conquer, and this is the strategy we should attach to.\n\nAs the Viceroy suggests, we should establish a fiefdom for Ibrohim Bey to rule as long as he and his Mujahideen stay loyal to us. This fiefdom should be organized similar to the 'Princely states' in India, so nominally a sovereign entity, but a subject to the suzerainty of the British crown."
bukhara.68.a: "At least we will earn their loyalty."

bukhara.69.t: "A System That Has Proven to Be Effective"
bukhara.69.d: "Along with the consolidation of British rule in Bukhara, Viceroy Malleson stressed the need to bring civilization to this wild and uncultured land--namely, to reform the Emir's backward system of government.\n\nAs an alternative, the viceroy proposed a system similar to that in British India. The basis of the parliamentary system would be a 56-member Legislative Assembly. Elections to local governments would be by curiae, depending on religious or ethnic affiliation.\n\nAlthough the Bukhara Government Act provoked much discontent, particularly among liberals who criticized it for being insufficiently representative, one party, the Young Bukharans, is expected to take over the next parliamentary elections, with the majority of seats going to nonpartisan pro-British candidates from the Viceroy's mandate list."
bukhara.69.a: "A great advancement for the peoples of Bukhara"

bukhara.70.t: "Battle for Bukhara"
bukhara.70.d: "In the aftermath of the revolution in Bukhara, Emir and his loyalists were forced to flee the capital, but they managed to settle in East Bukhara, far away from bustle of the industrialized regions. The army of the Mujahideen under the command of Emir and Ibrohim-Bey have led the faithful to reclaim the throne for the Emir. Reinforced and ready they managed to start the siege of the old capital. After days of siege the city dwellers began to understand who their real enemy is and, with the help of local Mullas have openly revolted against the revolutionaries. The gates to the city were opened and the Emir was restored to his legitimate throne. The Jadidist filth is to be fully erased. With Ibrohim-Bey claiming this victory as his personal, he has taken power in the Emirate in order to restore stability and order."
bukhara.70.a: "Victory!"

bukhara.71.t: "Hojaev Demands Reorganization of the Government"
bukhara.71.d: "Fayzulla Hojaev, the other leader of the revolutionary wing of our party has demanded that our government include true revolutionaries into the state apparatus. Furthermore, he has demanded to reorganize the government on councilist foundation, establishing the Council of People's Nazirs and transformation to a socialist republic. The danger of the socialist revolution greatly increases and we must be ready to repel its attack."
bukhara.71.a: "Include Hojaevites into the government."
bukhara.71.b: "We won't allow them to seize power."

bukhara.72.t: "Fayzulla Coups the Government"
bukhara.72.d: "Fayzulla Hojaev has gathered his loyalists and demanded our government to be dissolved and replaced by the new, truly people's, government. While initially he faced resistance, a lot of Dehkans have joined his putsch and, combined, with the complete loyalty to the revolutionary cause from our armed forces, he was quick to succeed."
bukhara.72.a: "Long live Dehkans of Bukhara!"
bukhara.72.b: "In a surprising turn of events, the British seize control!"

bukhara.73.t: "British Military in Bukhara"
bukhara.73.d: "We have received information that soon after the British victory in Afghanistan, their gaze fell on neighboring Bukhara. Even more surprisingly, despite our presence, our Political Agent Chirkin was informed that a British military mission was now also stationed in the country to ensure security. This situation cannot but strain us, or rather, it directly contradicts our strategic interests. We have the opportunity to influence Bukhara diplomatically and convince it to abandon the British, but we understand that this will actually lead to discontent and also to a deterioration of the situation. It seems that the choice remains small, since the British were able to beat us in this Great Game. There is only one thing left for us to do - to sever diplomatic ties with Bukhara and impose serious sanctions on it in response to their betrayal.."
bukhara.73.a: "This situation is unprecented! Threaten Bukhara with curtail subsidies!"
bukhara.73.b: "Another treason of unloyal subjects!"


bukhara.74.t: "Our Special Relationship"
bukhara.74.d: "With the seemingly impossible achieved and all of Turkestan united under the Crown, Viceroy Malleson has fully asserted himself over every functional government apparatus in Turkestan. Now that our triumph is at hand, we must now decide the relationship between our Dominion and the Delhi government. While the Dominion of Delhi has been of great help towards restoring order in Turkestan, their current government might be in conflict with our own aims and subsequently betray the very ideals of the Empire. Nonetheless, shall we continue to further cooperate with our gallant allies back in Delhi, or shall we declare our loyalty to the Crown only as the Dominion of the British Empire?"
bukhara.74.a: "We are loyal to India and the Empire!"
bukhara.74.b: "We are only loyal to the British Crown."


bukhara.82.t: "Alliance With [FROM.GetName]?"
bukhara.82.d: "After the Bukharan monarchy was consolidated, [FROM.GetLeader] has approached our government with a request to form once a great alliance between our nations. While they want to join us as equals, retaining all their current lands, we can possibly force them into a protectorate form of Imperial autonomy, once already forced against them."
bukhara.82.a: "Accept them as equals."
bukhara.82.b: "They should accept our Monarch's protectorate!"
bukhara.82.c: "Outright refuse alliance!"

bukhara.83.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Protectorate!"
bukhara.83.d: "Surprisingly, the Imperial government has offered us a different scenario - we must once again become their protectorate, as in pre-war times. Furthermore, we must give them back all the lands, that they had annexed from us in the good old days."
bukhara.83.a: "Reject!"
bukhara.83.b: "Our glorious Emirate shall thrive under the Russians!"

bukhara.84.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts Protectorate!"
bukhara.84.d: "Surprisingly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our demands and will join us as a protectorate."
bukhara.84.a: "Great!"

bukhara.85.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects Protectorate!"
bukhara.85.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused our demands."
bukhara.85.a: "They will pay for their betrayal!"

bukhara.86.t: "Turkmen Unrest in Charjuy"
bukhara.86.d: "Today it has become known that the local Turkmen population around Charjuy and Amu Darya has revolted against our rule. While the opposition and our enemies claim that the revolt was caused by the recent policies of ensuring Uzbek dominance in all internal and external affairs, we are sure that the [KHI.GetName] stands behind this revolt, initiating it and sponsoring the rebels with weapons and propaganda. We must not stand and watch how our nation is being torn apart by our neighbors and must react."
bukhara.86.a: "Crackdown on this revolt!"
bukhara.86.b: "We must rethink our policies towards minorities."

bukhara.87.t: "Turkmen Unrest in Charjuy"
bukhara.87.d: "Today it has become known that the local Turkmen population around Charjuy and Amu Darya in Bukhara has revolted against the rule of Bukhara. Possibly caused by the recent policies of ensuring Uzbek dominance in all internal and external affairs, the Turkmen revolts openly asks our state to help them in their struggle. Especially, after we received information that Bukhara wants to forcefully crack down on the revolt. If we intervene, a war can break out between our nations."
bukhara.87.a: "We are too weak, we should not intervene."
bukhara.87.b: "Seize Turkmen-majority territory, we won't leave our people!"

bukhara.88.t: "[FROM.GetName] Intervenes in Charjuy!"
bukhara.88.d: "Our fears have been realized and [FROM.GetName] has intervened on behalf of 'Turkmen people' into Charjuy, seizing not only the left-bank of Amu-Darya, but also the right bank, now their troops are standing close to our capital. This is an act of war and we must not close our eyes on it."
bukhara.88.a: "We are too weak, we should not respond!"
bukhara.88.b: "Declare war on their state!"

bukhara.89.t: "[FROM.GetName] Backs Down!"
bukhara.89.d: "The weak Bukharan government has refused to answer. We have now consolidated our control over the left and right banks of Amu Darya and the local leaders are very much grateful."
bukhara.89.a: "Great!"

bukhara.90.t: "Russian Coup in Bukhara"
bukhara.90.d: "Unfortunately, the direst apprehensions were borne out: over the course of time, the Russian Residency had established agents and networks in Bukhara, and once it became known that Russian forces were advancing on Bukhara, these clandestine agents emerged. The Bukhara branch of the Turkestan Military Organisation, with the direct support of the Residency and some prominent Russian enterprises, assumed control of the arsenal in Bukhara and marched towards the capital.\n\nThis sudden assault went unnoticed by the dispersed detachments of the Mujahideen, who did not have sufficient time to rally before Bukhara and New Bukhara were occupied. The remnants of loyalists retreated to the Pamirs, with some seeking refuge in Afghanistan, but in one way or another, our influence over the nation diminished — the Russian flag flew in Bukhara, and Sergey Chirkin, a political agent, was appointed interim governor of Bukhara."
bukhara.90.a: "Catastrophic!"

bukhara.91.t: "Russian Coup in Bukhara"
bukhara.91.d: "Thanks to the meticulously planned efforts of the Russian Residency in Bukhara, it was possible to establish an efficient apparatus and clandestine network of pro-Russian sympathizers prior to the outbreak of hostilities. The Bukhara branch of the Turkestan Military Organization, with the full support of the Residency and several prominent Russian enterprises, seized control of the arsenal and swiftly advanced towards the capital. Within a matter of hours, the government of Bukhara was brought down.\n\nIn the interim, Sergey Chirkin, the Resident in Bukhara, was appointed as the acting governor until our full authority over the region is consolidated."
bukhara.91.a: "Great!"


bukhara.110.t: "United Turkestan"
bukhara.110.d: "With [GetRulingParty] finally declaring the all-Turkestan national government and successfully liberating Bukhara and Fergana, the government is struggling with overextended bureacracy and administration. The remnants of both Jadidist and socialist organisations in former independent countries are now trying to fully integrate into the new system, while somewhat similar, but still different.\n\nWith our Jadidist party at helm, the most important question arises is what to do with the socialist opposition - the ERK, which for a long time advocated united Turkestan ideology and their leadership claiming to be the only legitimate government of Turkestan. Last, but not the least problem is the existence of other various Jadidist liberal groups, that demand representation and restructuring of our Bukhara-centered apparatus."
bukhara.110.a: "We must find solutions."

bukhara.111.t: "Fate of the ERK"
bukhara.111.d: "The ERK party, or Socialist Party of Turkestan, was one of the main proponents of Pan-Turkism and socialism in our region, having various factions and branches. In Bukhara, they were mainly represented by revolutionary wing of our own party and its leaders, Fayzulla Hojaev and Usmon Hoja. With the liberation of all Turkestan, the question now arises, whether we should allow the ERK movement to exist, as they are highly opposed to our rule."
bukhara.111.a: "ERK should be banned!"
bukhara.111.b: "We respect democratic opposition."

bukhara.112.t: "Integration With Jadidist Parties"
bukhara.112.d: "While it was believed that the Turkestan's Milliy Ittihod movement would be the uniting force of all Jadidist movement, as they long provided shelter to the exiled Young Khivans and Young Bukharans, eventually it was us, who liberated the region from conservatism and decay. Some of our ministers believe that we should be the only benefactors from this and found a new movement to represent all Jadidists in Turkestan. The others, however, suggest that we should not absorb the other parties and leave them be as local organisations in their respected regions."
bukhara.112.a: "Found a unifying force of Jadidists."
bukhara.112.b: "The Young Bukharans were behind liberation!"

bukhara.113.t: "Restoration of Ittifoqi Muslimin"
bukhara.113.d: "After the unification of Turkestan under our rule, the Qadimists have re-united into Ittifoqi Muslimin in order to confront Jadidist rule. While they are very unorganized and scattered, they pose no serious opposition, however."
bukhara.113.a: "Interesting."

bukhara.114.t: "Extraordinary Elections"
bukhara.114.d: "The government has decided that considering unification of Turkestan, it would be wise to hold new elections in the Majlis, in order to form a new government that would represent all population of our country. The elections are to be held in 2 months."
bukhara.114.a: "Wise decision."

bukhara.120.t: "Trouble with the Smallholders"
bukhara.120.d: "While the vast majority of plantations and agricultural land in our country belong to a select group of wealthy landowners, there are a number of well-to-do Dehkans who are struggling to survive in the face of competition from the trading elite and Russian companies. While the situation may be improving for large farmers and their friends in the Emir's administration, for many farmers, another crop failure or a drop in prices will cause them to lose control of their lands due to foreign creditors or even the meager savings they have accumulated. These dehkans have recently begun coordinating with each other to pool their resources and bail each other out of debt, and this project is largely supported by the agrarian socialist wing of the Young Bukharian Party. Our friends from the plantations have asked us to step in before this new movement gets out of control - after all, these small-time Dehkans are collaborating with radical socialists and using communal methods to undermine the positions of our allies. Insiders in the court assure us that the arrest of the gang leader on corruption charges will quickly bring the others to obedience. However, these brave Dehkans are one of the last remnants of our state, untouched by the power of [RUS.Capital.GetName], and we should think twice before sacrificing them for the happiness of our friends."
bukhara.120.a: "Nip these communists in the bud."
bukhara.120.b: "Leave these farmers be."

bukhara.121.t: "Emergency Meeting of the Viziers"
bukhara.121.d: "Following the devastation caused by the Black Monday disaster, the Emir and his Qoshbegi convened a series of meetings with the entire Council of Ministers aimed at tightening their belts and recovering from the economic downturn. Few common ground has been found, as individual ministers are more concerned with supporting the plans proposed by their patrons rather than making compromises and determining the best course of action. Qoshbegi Nizomiddin Urganji insisted on the forced decommissioning of some of the most expensive military toys, as well as those bigwigs who insisted on their introduction. He believes that although the emir is unlikely to support military spending cuts, temporary setbacks and potential emergencies can be overcome through closer coordination with Russia, which will give us more revenue to inject into an economy in free fall. Qaraulbegi Ibrohim Bey and his mujahideen are vehemently opposed to him, who instead proposed a fierce campaign against government corruption in order to regain the financial initiative, while maintaining the might of the armed forces to protect against increasingly aggressive actions from our neighbors. Of course, even he understands that money for economic recovery will not just grow out of the ground, but he strongly opposes further dependence on Russian aid. Instead, he believes that investing in the armed forces will create jobs for the unemployed, while increasing the emir's ability to enforce his taxes and force corrupt officials to comply. The Russians, for their part, suggested that none of the factions in the Council of Ministers had a viable plan to rebuild the emirate. Instead, their patron ministers proposed giving an \"independent\" committee of technocrats and experts broad powers to reform the Bukhara economy. Of course, most of these technocrats will be Russians, and this fact is difficult for most Bukharians, including the emir, to accept."
bukhara.121.a: "We must bulk up our military!"
bukhara.121.b: "Cut red tape and tighten our belt."
bukhara.121.c: "Turn to the Russian advisory."

bukhara.122.t: "Issues with the Officers"
bukhara.122.d: "Despite the fact that our armed forces bear traces of Ottoman and British influences, they are largely shaped by our Russian allies, who have imprinted their mark on regular army units that are increasingly becoming a source of pride for the emir.\n\nOn the other hand, irregular tribal formations, which have constituted the backbone of our military since the civil war, are deeply rooted in the territories of Ibrohim Bey, an ardent anti-Russian mujahid who steadfastly resists any genuine influence from [RUS.Capital.GetName] over these units. With Ibrohim Bey's ascension as the Qaraulbegi of the Emirate, he has attempted to wrest control over the Sarboz standing army units from Russian observers and instructors, to no avail.. However, the recent resolution to hold a display of these formations has become yet another battlefield between two opposing factions within the Bukhara military establishment. As a result, Russia's advocate, Qoshbegi Nizomiddin Urganji, once again found himself tasked with persuading the Emir to rein in his favourite attack dog.\n\nIbrahim bey insisted that no Russian national participate in the forthcoming parade, nor sit beside the Emir as he watches this display of national powert. Naturally, Qoshbegi cautioned that such actions would constitute a grave affront to our closest allies and, furthermore, could lead to issues regarding the removal of our less proficient units from their trained Russian commanders — after all, we do not wish anyone to begin marching in the incorrect direction."
bukhara.122.a: "Keep the Russian advisors and guests in the mix"
bukhara.122.b: "This is a celebration of Bukharan might, not Russian control!"

bukhara.123.t: "Qaraulbegi Alleges Corruption"
bukhara.123.d: "As far as the Qoshbegi Nizomiddin Urganji is concerned, even a broken clock is right twice a day. While he shares little in common with Qaraulbegi Ibrohim Bek, even he agrees that significant elements of the royal court are incredibly corrupt. Of course, his own friends and family who have become outrageously wealthy since his elevation as Qoshbegi are just lucky - there is no way that the Emir's most trusted advisor could be corrupt.\n\nUnfortunately, Ibrohim Bey has recently focused his attention upon the Minister of Finance and our Chief Zakotchi (The Supreme Collector of Zakat).\n\nDespite the fact that many would argue that Mirza Salimbek ibn Muhammad Rahim, a retired divanbegi and a veteran of the Bukharan–Bolshevik war, is too old to handle financial matters in his age, Qaraulbegi directly accused the aged vizier of engaging in corrupt practices and favouring Russian interests. In response, Karaul Beg proposed a contentious solution: to appoint one of his confidants, Davlatmandbek Kamoliddinbek, as Kurbashi. If Kurbashi is permitted to appoint his own representative, it would further consolidate his power."
bukhara.123.a: "Allow Ibrohim Bek to run wild."
bukhara.123.b: "Discard this allegiations."

bukhara.124.t: "The Qaraulbegi Demands Action"
bukhara.124.d: "As tensions rise in Central Asia, more and more voices have begun clamouring for a committed push by our government to properly equip and prepare a fighting force which could hold its own against Turkestani, Persian, or Afghani prodding. The foremost voice in this camp has been the Qaraulbegi, who has pushed hard for reforms to our militias, army, and quartermasters.\n\nOf course, most of these proposed changes just so happen to place more power into the hands of the Qaraulbegi and his allies, but he is not alone in his sense of urgency and low opinion of our current prospects. The Russians have also begun prodding the Emir, hoping that with tensions rising in the west, they can devote less attention to our region by relying more on a capable autonomous Bukharan military. While there is little friendship or coordination between the Russians and Qaraulbegi, their voices combined have begun to put considerable pressure on the Emir and his Qoshbegi."
bukhara.124.a: "I suppose we will try our best!"

bukhara.125.t.normal: "The Reformists Demand Reform"
bukhara.125.t.complete: "Reformists Commend our Reforms"
bukhara.125.d.normal: "When it comes to reform movements, one often thinks of democratic and liberal organizations such as the \"Young Bukharans\", which, of course, does not enjoy official status in governmental circles. In fact, their presence within the Emirate borders could potentially cost them their lives.\n\nHowever, despite their lack of formal political influence, these instigators make up for it with their extensive network of underground contacts within the local population and administrative structures. They have recently intensified their efforts to implement significant institutional reforms, employing carefully crafted criticism that bypasses our censorship mechanisms and is widely disseminated through both printed media and word-of-mouth. While we may choose to simply disregard these nuisances, it is evident that they anticipate a response from us... To compound the situation, their appeals for \"disentangling the bureaucratic maze\" were also seized upon by supporters of Ibrohim Bey, who have long espoused the cause of decentralization — albeit in his own self-interest and in the interests of the revitalized Bukhara Army."
bukhara.125.d.complete: "When it comes to reform movements, one often thinks of democratic and liberal organizations such as the \"Young Bukharans\", which, of course, does not enjoy official status in governmental circles. In fact, their presence within the Emirate borders could potentially cost them their lives.\n\nDespite the fact that these instigators seldom express their appreciation for our government, our recent endeavours aimed at reforming the central bureaucracy of the Emirate have garnered the attention of numerous prominent figures within their movement. The liberal media, which is often characterized by a degree of ambiguity, with criticism often concealed behind enthusiastic expressions of support for the Emir, have wholeheartedly expressed their interest in and support for our recent initiatives to restructure and optimize the overburdened bureaucracy."
bukhara.125.a: "Try not to ignore them."
bukhara.125.b: "Nice!"

bukhara.126.t: "Poor Quality Uniforms"
bukhara.126.d: "In many ways, the prestige of a kingdom is its most valuable currency. When the trappings of the monarchy are lacking, it is only a matter of time before subjects start to question the righteousness of their station. Nowhere is this more important than in the ranks of the Emirate's armies, whose soldiers are dressed in a motley hodge-podge of uniforms. In the past few years, attempts have been made to unify the dress of our soldiers, but each attempt has been stymied by syphoned resources and mixed priorities.\n\nA recent parade, meant to celebrate the anniversary of our wonderful Emir's birthday and rise to his position as ruler of Bukhara, ended in embarrassment, as we were unable to find suitably well dressed men to supplement the ranks, leaving the parade a display of our failures.This disaster  has once again brought this issue to the forefront among a number of our military leaders, who have requested that we pursue a concerted effort to produce a single universal Bukharan uniform of acceptable quality, at least for those men expected to march in annual holiday parades!"
bukhara.126.a: "Replace these rags!"
bukhara.126.b: "Looks are not everything..."

bukhara.127.t: "Flight of the Barons"
bukhara.127.d: "In the wake of the recent economic collapse, some of even the most insulated and loyal Russian plantation owners are leaving the Emirate to seek their fortunes back in the mother country. According to some of our informants, the grumbling actually began before the recent downturn, as more and more capitalists saw their days numbered with the rising star of Qaraulbegi Ibrohim Bey, who has long and loudly called for the 'death of all heathen foreign devils' and the 'destruction of the godless cotton fields.'\n\nWhile obviously Ibrohim Bey does not rule Bukhara, he has increasingly captured the Emir's attention, leaving many Russians wondering when their time in Bukhara may be cut short. Of course, the vast majority of the large landowners have stayed, and our loyal Qoshbegi Nizomiddin Urganji has made a circuit of the major plantations, assuring these loyal entrepreneurs that we remain committed to their prosperity and well being, especially when we are in desperate need of their cash."
bukhara.127.a: "We are sorry to see them go."

bukhara.128.t: "Grumbling Among the Officers"
bukhara.128.d: "We have recently received a petition from several of our senior officers, requesting that we award their subordinates with the sweeping medals and citations we promised them only a month earlier. These promotions were offered as a consolation for snubbing some of the old windbags, and it appears that many staked their reputation with the junior soldiery on the awards and cash prizes to come. Do they not see that we are in the midst of economic ruin? It is the fault of the officer who makes grand promises of treasure and glory to his junior officers, not that of the state, when these promises do not come true. These parade generals will need to swallow their pride, a dubious prospect at best. Instead, it is likely that they will poison the ears of the rank and file and complain to Ibrohim Bey, whose hatred of the Qoshbegi and the financial officers is fertile ground for the sad tales of the old windbags. Regardless, there is literally nothing we can do, short of hamstringing our recovery from ruin in favor of stoking these egos."
bukhara.128.a: "They will just have to swallow their pride"

bukhara.129.t: "[GetMonth]'s Quartermaster Report"
bukhara.129.d: "Our recent reexamination of our preparedness for an armed conflict against our neighbours has determined that we are woefully unready to engage in an open war. Many stockpiles, listed in dusty tomes and marked on maps, lie empty, aside from the weapons held by guards patrolling a fictitious arsenal. Those units who are armed often present a motley visage, with mismatched uniforms and armaments, some wielding modern surplus weaponry while others are stuck using matchlock rifles and crude spears.\n\nTo counteract these shortfalls, officers and quartermasters alike have demanded a new infusion of cash to purchase foreign surplus rifles to better bring our soldiers up to speed. Unfortunately, most of these officers and quartermasters are incredibly corrupt, and there are questions whether a significant portion of any bags of money given to them will make it to gun markets, or whether any crates of guns will actually find their way into the hands of our warriors or to fill stockpiles."
bukhara.129.a: "Give these officers what they need."
bukhara.129.b: "We simply cannot afford it."

bukhara.130.t: "Meet with the Eastern Chiefs"
bukhara.130.d: "The Lokai are the third largest tribe of Uzbeks in eastern Bukhara, a collection of small family clans which have relentlessly fought to secure a position of power and prominence in the Emirate. On the way, they managed to make enemies of their neighbours and the late Emir, developing a reputation as reckless and wild troublemakers who would do anything to increase their power and secure their position. For a brief moment, it appeared that the Emir would move to crush the Lokai and put down these troublemakers, but the violence of the Russian Civil War made the fiercely fundamentalist Lokai tribesmen a much sought after commodity.\n\nIn the years following, the Lokai chieftain found the ear of the young Emir, becoming a leading advisor and military figure before recently being elevated into the position of Qaraulbegi of the Emirate. Since then, the Lokai clans have run wild over their neighbours, pushing the boundaries of tradition and ignoring unfavorable rulings from local Qazis. The aggrieved tribal leaders have trickled into the capital, seeking the ear of the Qoshbegi and the Emir to settle a number of their more minor complaints. They have gathered together, promising significant contributions from their brethren to the national cause should the Emir lease his dog, but his majesty is in no rush to chastise Ibrohim Bey, and it would take serious prodding from the Qoshbegi and others to force him to hear out these beleaguered elders."
bukhara.130.a: "The support of the minor tribes is too valuable"
bukhara.130.b: "The enemy of my friend is my enemy"

bukhara.131.t: "Handling the 'Miller Qazis'"
bukhara.131.d: "Historically, the power to grant seals of office is a significant boon, one which gives said organ of government sweeping control over the makeup of the office. With regard to the Qazis, magistrates, or judges of our nation's Sharia courts, who additionally serve as mediators, guardians of orphans, educators, and supervisors of public works, the seals of office have traditionally been bestowed by the Emir himself, through his ministers and with the guidance of the Ulama.\n\nWhile the 1917 April Manifesto envisaged a fundamental overhaul of the Qazi system that allowed some Qazi judges to be selected by local councils, in practice, the election of Qazis has not been implemented, as there was no body that could distribute these figures' seals. Regardless, there are still a number of currently practising judges, so to speak, with a \"Jadid\" inclination, who frequently interpret Fiqh more liberally than the conservative Ulama. They often draw upon tribal law, Sufi mysticism, and local customs in their rulings. The Ulama have persistently urged us to revoke the seals of several of these most unorthodox Qazis. However, there is little legal precedent to support such an action."
bukhara.131.a: "They are dangerous heretics."
bukhara.131.b: "They have served us reasonably."

bukhara.132.t: "Shuffling the Parvanchi and Toqsababashi?"
bukhara.132.d: "The Parvanchi (Master of ceremonies) and Toqsababashi (Chief of the Standard) are some of the junior officials appointed by the Emir to serve at his court, who mostly handle minor matters related to tapestries, pomp, and furnishings. In recent years, these positions have been more or less "sold" to wealthy patrons of the crown, with the most recent pair being a pair of well-known Uzbek merchants who used their newfound positions, bought with generous gifts to the emir, to encourage their business partners in the textile trade. Although their corruption is obvious, these people have friends all over the emirate, among bureaucrats, the nobility, and even outside the state, where many of their fellow merchants demand the overthrow of our divine absolutism. Their abolition may be unpopular, but the emir can easily be convinced of the benefits once he sees what it costs the treasury each year."
bukhara.132.a: "Rid ourselves of these corrupt parasites"
bukhara.132.b: "They have too many allies!"

bukhara.133.t: "Removing the Mir Akhor?"
bukhara.133.d: "The Mir Akhor, or Master of the Horse, is a position of great honor in the Emirate, even as modern times call into question the modern role of the most noble of creatures in warfare. The modern role has been modelled in part after that of the Russian Konyushy, with similar responsibilities over the Emir's stables and the breeding of military steeds. The central treasury awards this position with significant sums of gold to purchase and outfit the Emir's horse with harnesses, horse armor, and to procure breeding studs, meaning that the role has become lucrative as well as honorable for more unscrupulous appointees. The current Mir Akhor is a former Bey from one of the eastern Uzbek tribes, well respected by the traditionalists and the Emir, but uncontestedly unfit for his role. Under his tenure, the stables have fallen into disrepair, leading to the Qoshbegi to move for his replacement."
bukhara.133.a: "Cast out this ancient Mir Akhor!"
bukhara.133.b: "The traditionalists would be furious..."

bukhara.134.t: "Replacing the Mirzabashi?"
bukhara.134.d: "The Mirzabashi, or Chief Secretary, is a vital element of our day to day governance. With their hand in all levels of government, and coordination with the various Ministers, the Russian Resident Sergey Chirkin, and even the Qaraulbegi, the Mirzabashi has a unique position to affect government policy. While our current Mirzabashi is certainly effective, he is increasingly seen as a pawn of Sergey Chirkin and his team of Russian advisors, who are worryingly involved in the maintenance of our administration. Some of our spies have seen him meeting with the Russians outside of the bounds of the Ark, potentially scheming for the removal of the Emir or his most loyal Qoshbegi, and his replacement with a more pliable figure to [RUS.Capital.GetName]. Already, Chirkin has moved to remove Qoshbegi Nizomiddin Urganji in the years following the conclusion of the Russian Civil War, and there is no love lost between the two men. By creating some creative proof of the Mirzabashi's involvement in a conspiracy, and then disseminating this evidence to the Emir, we would be justified in removing him, but it is likely that the Russians themselves would see through this ruse, potentially spoiling whatever working relationship we have built with them."
bukhara.134.a: "Remove this Muscovite puppet!"
bukhara.134.b: "We cannot afford to upset our Russian guests"

It is a Russophile current that seeks to centralize the Emirate, to hold on to the Emir’s absolute power, in other words, the status quo. The second is the rather young reformist Mujahideen movement, which arose out of the popularity of Qaraulbegi, §FIbrahim Bey§!. They strive for the complete sovereignty of Bukhara from the Russian influence, and are intoxicated with the ideas of modernization of Bukhara through decentralization and unification of the tribes. After the brutal repression of the Jadidists and their transition to predominantly republican positions, the §lYoung Bukharans§! were forced to flee the country, but their influence on the people is still a necessary balancing element so that the Emirate does not plunge into revolution.\n\nTo tell the truth, the §gCouncil of Ministers§! is not quite effective, it is mired in conceit and corruption, and the soonest renewal of it is felt not only among the reformists, but even by the Emir Himself.[GetBukharaDecentralizations][CheckBukharaKushbegiInfluence][CheckBukharaKaraulbegiInfluence][CheckBukharaRussianInfluence][CheckBukharaReformistInfluence]"

Russian capital and machinery have brought technological advancements, such as railroads, gold mines and cotton plantations, yet the lion's share of profits flows back to Russian owners, leaving us with a meager portion derived from our own lands and resources."

UZB_stagnant_government_bureaucracy: "Stagnant Government Bureaucracy"
UZB_stagnant_government_bureaucracy_desc: "Tensions brew among the emirate's government branches. Emir Alim Khan's direct interference and favoritism towards loyalists have paralyzed the once-efficient state machinery. The feud between Qoshbegi Nizomiddin Urganji and Qaraulbegi Ibrohim Bey threatens bureaucratic collapse. Reformists fear a complete breakdown, while conservatives criticize the system as weakened and fractured by reform attempts."
UZB_antiquated_army: "Dilapidated Military"
UZB_antiquated_army_desc: "Despite Emir Alim Khan's education at Russian military academies and assistance from Russian advisors, our efforts to modernize the Bukhara army face continuous challenges with limited success. Much of our fighting force remains a tribal levy drafted in crises, slow to adapt to modern equipment and tactics. Urgent reforms are needed to avoid vulnerability in potential conflicts."
UZB_wind_of_changes: "Wind of Changes"
UZB_wind_of_changes_desc: "The 25th anniversary of Emir's rule was overshadowed by mass demonstrations initiated by Young Baharans and riots in the capital. Instead of the promised popular festivities and lavish treats, people received scandal and violence. Reformers among those close to the emir persuaded Alim Khan to announce reforms, a decree that became known as the January Promises, which spoke of rapid reforms in the emirate. As long as the January Promises are valid and their memory is fresh, any action we take to strengthen the Emir's power will provoke a violent reaction."

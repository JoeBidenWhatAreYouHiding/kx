### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HEINRICH_GOLDBERG_DESC:0 "Heinrich Goldberg first came to prominence as the leader of a small anarchist commune on the outskirts of Berlin during the Weltkrieg and subsequent flight from the country to the then newly established Commune of France. While in France, his views became increasingly coloured by French orthodox syndicalism, and upon his departure for the Dominican Republic in 1928, he had become a fervent supporter of Emile Pouget\nIn the Dominican Republic, his early efforts to promote syndicalism were mostly ineffective, but he managed to cultivate a small and devoted following, becoming the face of the Syndicalist movement in his adopted country."
POLITICS_PERDRO_HENRIQUEZ_URENA_DESC:0 "While slandered by political opponents for his marriage to the sister of Mexican Syndicalist, Vicente Lombardo Toledano, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, son of former president Francisco Henríquez Carvajal, returned to the Dominican Republic after years abroad to a great degree of fanfare. Despite comparisons to his radical brother-in-law, however, Henríquez is by no means a syndicalist; the principled writer, is however, more than willing to work any across the political spectrum who subscribe to the view that the Dominican Republic, and indeed all of Latin America, should be entirely free of imperialist influence, and able to fully choose their own destiny."
POLITICS_JUAN_JIMENES_GRULLON_DESC:0 "Juan Jimenes Grullón, son of former president Juan Jimenes Pereyra, despite the decline of progressivism in the Dominican Republic during the American occupation, is a true believer of the ideals of his father's Jimenistas. The younger Jimenes entered politics soon after returning to the Dominican Republic in 1929 from Germany, and soon established a small but devoted following."
POLITICS_ESTRELLA_URENA_DESC:0 "Rafael Estrella Ureña, while ideologically a social and economic reformist, gained a great deal of infamy even before the American occupation for his seemingly endless ambition and lust for political power. Since the end of the occupation, Estrella's name has only become further tainted by his willingness to work closely with both the military and members of the nation's economic elite."
POLITICS_MARTINEZ_REYNA_DESC:0 "Virgilio Martínez Reyna was essential to the 1924 election of Horacio Vásquez Lajara as the Dominican Republic's first president since the American Occupation. In his own presidential tenure, he has been equally central to the nation's incessant political turmoil. While popular and far less corrupt than his predecessors, Martínez's failure to quell discontent amongst the nation's economic elite and even begin to address the political power of the Army precipitated the nation's political direction thereafter.\nIdeologically, Martínez draws heavily on a uniquely populous Catholic corporatism, and while indeed not entirely authoritarian, is more than willing to undermine the foundations of Dominican democracy if need be."
POLITICS_MANUEL_CONCHA_DESC:0 "Manuel Troncoso Concha, once a small-time corporate lawyer, came to public prominence through connections to General Rafael Trujillo. Often accused of being little more than a puppet for Trujillo, Troncoso's fate, despite his denial of such accusations, has become inexorably linked to that of the general."
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TRUJILLO_DESC:0 "A young Rafael Trujillo so impressed the occupying American Marine Corps. that he was hastily promoted to in the occupation Dominican Army. Trujillo used his position to amass warlordlike control over much of the country. So great was his power and ambition that the various administrations which followed the nation's independence in 1924 that each based much of its decisionmaking on preventing him from making a grab for power. Now in full control of the country as he has so long desired, Trujillo works closely with organized crime to line his pockets and strengthen quell descent. He also seeks to bring the tumultuous western border fully under control and eliminate the threat posed by Haitians there once and for all."
POLITICS_ERNESTO_BONETTI_DESC:0 "An aspiring lawyer, skilled baseball player, and the sport's most prolific patron in the Dominican Republic, despite his young age, Pilindo Bonetti threw his lot in with Trujillo early, proclaiming his support for the general before fawning crowds on multiple occasions. Now, after winning a presidential election that made few illusions to being fair or free, Bonetti does the general's bidding as little more than a puppet, doing his best to create the illusion of democracy in the Dominican Republic."
POLITICS_RAMON_VASQUEZ_DESC:0 "An early ally of Trujillo, General Ramon Vasquez Rivera is perhaps the most politically ambitious of The Chief's closest confidants. General Rivera was quick to seize the opportunity for political ascendence and now rules in the image of Trujillo."

### Focuses ###
DOM_election:0 "Presidential Election"
DOM_election_desc:0 "In a controversial move, President Martínez had the constitution modified to allow him to run for a consecutive term. He faces bitter opposition from Estrella and the Republicanos as well as the Dominican military in a race that is sure to shape the future of our nation."
DOM_rojo_victory:0 "Rojo Victory"
DOM_rojo_victory_desc:0 "The Rojos of President Martínez have won the Presidential election."
DOM_rojo_victory_1:0 "Through Work, Dignity"
DOM_rojo_victory_1_desc:0 "The Partido Rojo has always stood for morality above all; rampant unemployment is surely both a blight on our economy and as detrimental to popular dignity as any other form of moral decay. The unemployed should thus be organised into labour brigades tasked with public works projects. As well, they should be made to attend religious functions to ensure rehabilitation."
DOM_rojo_victory_1_2:0 "Principled Development"
DOM_rojo_victory_1_2_desc:0 "Morality must be built into the very fabric of a nation. As we pursue that which makes all countries prosper, industrialisation, we must never lose sight of that truth. We must have monuments to what is upright and proper along with factories and mills and indeed even places of industry must instill that truth in their workforce; our labour brigades would be well suited for this task."
DOM_rojo_victory_2:0 "Call Constitutional Convention"
DOM_rojo_victory_2_desc:0 "While President Martinez has long sought to drastically amend the constitution, he has lacked the political capital to push for all but the most minor changes to the document. With the resounding victory of the Rojos in the 1936 election, however, the constitutional assembly can be properly convened."
DOM_rojo_victory_2_1:0 "The New Republic"
DOM_rojo_victory_2_1_desc:0 "The Constitution of 1924 was born from the American Occupation and is insufficient as the foundational document of a true democracy. A new document entirely has been drafted and now must be implemented."
DOM_rojo_victory_2_2:0 "If It Ain't Broke..."
DOM_rojo_victory_2_2_desc:0 "The Constitutional Assembly has reaffirmed the 1924 Constitution and our democracy will undoubtedly carry on as before."
DOM_rojo_victory_2_3:0 "Fight Judicial Discrimination"
DOM_rojo_victory_2_3_desc:0 "The judiciary has always been slow to take to reforms, and despite renewed political impetus from the Constitutional Convention, lower courts will surely continue to arbitrarily discriminate against vast swaths of the population. We must do all in our power to begin to change this."
DOM_rojo_victory_3:0 "The Trial"
DOM_rojo_victory_3_desc:0 "Our nation has been betrayed and as those responsible prepare to stand before their fellow Dominicans and the nation's courts, all await with outcome with trepidation."
DOM_rojo_victory_3_1:0 "Reform Military Districts"
DOM_rojo_victory_3_1_desc:0 "The system of military districts established by the Americans during the occupation naturally encourages a sort of warlordism that allowed Trujillo and other military strongmen to thrive; it must be reformed."
DOM_rojo_victory_2_4:0 "Land Reform"
DOM_rojo_victory_2_4_desc:0 "The bountiful lands of our republic are held hostage by corrupt absentee landowners. These lands must be redistributed to both individuals and companies with a clear track-record of responsibility and profitability."
DOM_rojo_victory_2_5:0 "Responsible Bureaucracy"
DOM_rojo_victory_2_5_desc:0 "The bureaucracy has become bloated and ineffective. To curb frivolous expense, we must introduce rigid fiscal responsibility rules and hold bureaucrats accountable to the people and elected government."
DOM_rojo_victory_2_6:0 "The Phoenix"
DOM_rojo_victory_2_6_desc:0 "The Dominican Republic has been conquered again and again - Spaniard or Haitian or American, it matters not, for our valiant nation shall always rise from the ashes like a phoenix reborn. With political turmoil at an end, it seems we have again arisen."
DOM_post_elec_1:0 "Root Out Traitors"
DOM_post_elec_1_desc:0 "Those in the military who remain disloyal will prove to be a nuisance if left alone. Every officer with but a hint of suspicion about him but be dismissed and a replacement prepared."
DOM_post_elec_2:0 "Military Reapprochement"
DOM_post_elec_2_desc:0 "While certainly the treasonous influence of Trujillo and others still stains our armed forces, it would be foolish to not offer some degree of clemency. We must work to reintegrate tainted officers and soldiers alike."
DOM_post_elec_3:0 "Empower Loyal Officers"
DOM_post_elec_3_desc:0 "The extent of disloyalty in the armed forces has become clear and slowly but surely, soldiers and officers alike have come to serve our country rather than their officers. As well, some officers, especially junior officers, have entirely cleared of traitorous affiliations. They must be retrained for higher offices and promoted to truly ensure the loyalty of the military."
DOM_post_elec_4:0 "Departamento de Seguridad"
DOM_post_elec_4_desc:0 "The difficulty of controlling the military has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that democracy will never be safe from threats within and without. As such, to preserve our liberty, we must actively protect it. The Department of Security is a proposed executive office dedicated to the gathering of intelligence independent of the armed forces and the suppression of extra-legal opposition."
DOM_post_elec_5:0 "Las Lechuzas"
DOM_post_elec_5_desc:0 "As our party has ingratiated itself with elements of society considered by some to be immoral, we have become reliant on these connections to keep a finger on the daily activities of our rivals. To ensure that no group may ever threaten our government, these agents should be more formally under our party's control and properly equipped to eliminate dissent."
DOM_republicano_victory:0 "Republicano Victory"
DOM_republicano_victory_desc:0 "The Republicanos of Rafael Estrella Ureña have emerged victorious."
DOM_republicano_victory_1:0 "Old Friends, New Enemies"
DOM_republicano_victory_1_desc:0 "Trujillo and his supporters will always pose a threat to the stability of our government unless decisively dealt with. While some may lament such dealings outside the purview of the courts as 'injustice', we know that it is necessary."
DOM_republicano_victory_1_1:0 "Friends In Low Places"
DOM_republicano_victory_1_1_desc:0 "As our ties with the military have been fully severed, our party requires a new constituency to ingratiate itself to. In the dregs of society, we have such a group. Long forgotten and even condemned by the Rojos and the parties of before the occupation, those who work in fields others consider immoral, should be the focus of our outreach."
DOM_republicano_victory_2:0 "The Most Dangerous Game"
DOM_republicano_victory_2_desc:0 "In dealing with those who know only how to give orders and not to receive them, with those who believe themselves king of their own little sliver of our nation, we must exercise caution. The promises we made in the past to the nation's elite must not be either honored or fully disregarded."
DOM_republicano_victory_2_1:0 "Respect Our Obligations"
DOM_republicano_victory_2_1_desc:0 "We would be foolish to throw away the support of those with the most ability to influence our nation's politics. We must respect promises made to our nation's wealthy, even where such may cause economic harm."
DOM_republicano_victory_2_2:0 "Assert Authority"
DOM_republicano_victory_2_2_desc:0 "While the upper classes form a key constituency for our party, we cannot afford to make concessions to them. We must instead move to eliminate their political and economic influence."
DOM_republicano_victory_2_3:0 "As Within, So Without"
DOM_republicano_victory_2_3_desc:0 "Backroom dealings and under-the-table handshakes have been the hallmark of our party's rise to power. This strategy is as valid in governing or foreign policy as in securing power, yet the skill set needed to successfully conduct this sort of diplomacy is difficult to learn. Such dealings must be normalised and encouraged."
DOM_republicano_victory_2_4:0 "Great Minds Think Alike"
DOM_republicano_victory_2_4_desc:0 "The individual drive to succeed is undoubtedly the most powerful driver of economic prosperity. While our country may be poor, surely with so much conflict and repression in the world, by fully opening our nation to skilled immigrants, we will find many clambering at our shores."
DOM_republicano_victory_2_5:0 "Trim The Fat"
DOM_republicano_victory_2_5_desc:0 "The bureaucracy is bloated and much of what our government has taken to administering amounts purely to expense without much benefit. To preserve that which is worthwhile, the bureaucracy must be streamlined."
DOM_republicano_victory_3:0 "Sowing The Seeds Of Prosperity"
DOM_republicano_victory_3_desc:0 "We are undeniably an agricultural and export-oriented nation. We lack the facilities necessary however, to create even basic finished goods. Cannot companies cut their cane or roll their tobacco at least in part domestically? We must subsidise the creation of facilities to do just that."
DOM_republicano_victory_3_1:0 "Retrofit Ports"
DOM_republicano_victory_3_1_desc:0 "Our exports, while now processed much more effectively, are stifled by aging domestic port infrastructure. Let us retrofit and expand these facilities and allow our economy room to grow."
DOM_republicano_victory_2_6:0 "The New Normal"
DOM_republicano_victory_2_6_desc:0 "Politics is no longer the quagmire it once was and with political stability has also come a degree of economic prosperity. People have begun to adjust to this state of affairs and their outlook on the future is brighter than ever."
DOM_post_elec_research:0 "Sponsored Research"
DOM_post_elec_research_desc:0 "With a precedent of funding clandestine organisations established and our political situation stabilised, an interesting proposal has been put on our President's desk. That being to discreetly offer substantial research grants to various industrial concerns to conduct priority research."

DOM_coup:0 "Coup"
DOM_coup_desc:0 "Insidious forces conspire to overthrow President Martínez. If the military and Estrella manage to reach an agreement, perhaps such a plot will be put into action."
DOM_consolpower:0 "Consolidating Power"
DOM_consolpower_desc:0 "Estrella and Martínez alike no longer stand in Trujillo's path to power. Viva Trujillo!"
DOM_formalgov:0 "Formalize New Regime"
DOM_formalgov_desc:0 "To continue to govern as a provision regime would be not only detrimental to our power, but also reflect poorly on us internationally. We must establish a true civilian government."
DOM_coup4:0 "Militarized Bureaucracy"
DOM_coup4_desc:0 "The bureaucracy, already notoriously slow to change, is rife with dissidents and enemies of the state, slowly but surely undermining our regime. The entire rotten thing must be split open and sewn back together with a new spirit and staffers."
DOM_coup5:0 "Engage Elites"
DOM_coup5_desc:0 "To lose all control must be a dreadful feeling indeed. Perhaps though, those who once were the brokers of power could still be of some use; their fate must be decided."
DOM_coup6:0 "Entrench The Party"
DOM_coup6_desc:0 "Our glorious party is ultimately the only redoubt of unwavering loyalty. To set society on the path to a similar outlook, the influence of the party must be greatly expanded. Though, how to go about that is hotly debated."
DOM_coup7:0 "Modernisation Campaign"
DOM_coup7_desc:0 "So much of our nation lacks modern utilities like electrical power, and some economically important city centres have not been renovated in decades. Before the economy can truly heal, these problems must be dealt with."
DOM_coup8:0 "Guided Democracy"
DOM_coup8_desc:0 "Our people expect democracy, and rightfully so. Democracy, however, cannot carry on as it did before our party swept into power. Such weakness would be our downfall. A more complete democracy must have a firm hand upon it."
DOM_coup9:0 "Maintain the Status-Quo"
DOM_coup9_desc:0 "While Trujillo has pushed to secure more and more power for himself, and indeed his leadership is righteous, constructive pushback from both the military and purely civilian allies has limited his control. While outsiders may slander us with words like 'junta', we know that our course is correct."
DOM_coup10:0 "Dios en Cielo, Trujillo en Tierra"
DOM_coup10_desc:0 "'God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth'; there does not exist a more apt expression than that. While already undeniably at the forefront of the government, Trujillo has only grown in power as our regime has cemented itself, sidelining all other major figures within the military in the process. The people and the nation now look to him for guidance as we navigate an uncertain future."
DOM_coup11:0 "Ex Uno Plura"
DOM_coup11_desc:0 "From one, many. Perhaps a bit-in-cheek, this reversal of the motto of the United States suits our government well. It is only with assured political unity that liberty and democracy can truly thrive."
DOM_coup12:0 "Call Special Election"
DOM_coup12_desc:0 "Elections, the hallmark of democracy. While our last election was indeed something of a farce, the need then to begin to consolidate our regime more than justifies such a move. Now, at last, we can return democracy to the people, and the question of which of our carefully selected candidates will win has the entire country holding its breath in anticipation."
DOM_coup13:0 "Control the Legislature"
DOM_coup13_desc:0 "With a taste of power, those who once swore allegiance only to their betters would seek to undermine all that we have built for their own gain. While we must maintain a legislative body to carry out the passage and implementation of legislation for the mundane, and indeed, it also provides legitimacy, the actions of the legislature must be systematically controlled."
DOM_coup14:0 "Political Vigilance"
DOM_coup14_desc:0 "A government such as ours can only be maintained if the populace reflects the values of such a regime. The people must never forget the virtues of martial prowess and constant political vigilance and will."
DOM_coup15:0 "Viva El Jefe!"
DOM_coup15_desc:0 "Trujillo, our leader, our chief, shall protect our nation now and forever. Long may he be both the sword and the shield of our people!"

DOM_tackle_depression:0 "The New Economy"
DOM_tackle_depression_desc:0 "Our nation's economy is changing rapidly and traditional sectors and economic thinking cannot assure the depression's end. We must look to the future for the sake of the present."
DOM_tourist:0 "Encourage Tourism"
DOM_tourist_desc:0 "Leisure travel has boomed with the advent of commercial aviation and the proliferation of purpose-built cruise liners. Our pristine shores are naturally a perfect destination for tourism. We must work closely with companies offering leisure travel to promote such travel to our country."
DOM_lux_hotels:0 "Construct Luxury Hotels"
DOM_lux_hotels_desc:0 "Though tourism is already booming, that success has been muted thanks mostly to a lack of luxury accommodations even in the most developed localities in our country. We must subsidise the construction of grand beach-front hotels with seemingly endless amenities. The palaces of pleasure will surely attract an even greater crowd."
DOM_resources:0 "Resource Exploration"
DOM_resources_desc:0 "Various American companies invested in resource exploration throughout our land during the occupation. None of these attempts to assess our natural wealth amounted to anything, however. Let us pick up where they left off, surely this bountiful land holds even greater treasure beneath it."
DOM_bauxite:0 "Establish Bauxite Mines"
DOM_bauxite_desc:0 "While Bauxite deposits were known to be present on our island, until recently the mines were largely unexploited. As some small mining operations have cropped up following our nation's push to assess its mineral wealth, there presents an opportunity to begin to truly exploit our nation's bauxite."
DOM_precious:0 "Encourage Precious Metal Mining"
DOM_precious_desc:0 "Our land has always produced a small but steady bounty of gold. However, our gold deposits are not truly exploited and mining operations quite limited. Surely, however, if we provided subsidies for gold exploration and exploitation, that could quickly change."
DOM_plantations:0 "Connect The Plantations"
DOM_plantations_desc:0 "Transporting goods from rural plantations and farms is time consuming and economically harmful, not to mention stifling for those who toil so far from the cities. We should construct roads and light rail between agricultural areas and our existing infrastructural network."
DOM_mills:0 "Local Mills"
DOM_mills_desc:0 "Each plantation has at least some of the tools and manpower necessary to begin small scale production of more industrial goods. Wherever possible, we should encourage and incentivise plantations to pursue the construction of small industrial mills."
DOM_fight_corruption:0 "Fight Corruption"
DOM_fight_corruption_desc:0 "Bribery and graft, on both a local and national level and in both the public and private sectors, abound. All of our reforms may well come to nothing if such insidious behaviour undermines them. We should actively attempt to root our corrupt businessmen and officials and impose strong legal penalties on them."
DOM_fight_corruption_2:0 "Economic Norms"
DOM_fight_corruption_2_desc:0 "A prosperous people must not only be free from the oppressive influence of corruption, but also accustomed to economic practices which benefit all individually and collectively. These positive norms must be encouraged both in the public and private sectors."

DOM_the_incident:0 "The Monte Cristi Affair"
DOM_the_incident_desc:0 "While not strictly speaking part of the borderland, the town of Monte Cristi has become home to a large number of Haitian migrants. One night, amidst rising tensions between these Haitians and local security forces, all hell broke loose."
DOM_rampup:0 "Militarise the Border"
DOM_rampup_desc:0 "War with Haiti now seems imminent. We must pour whatever resources we can into the creation of makeshift defenses along the border in case the worst is to come."
DOM_corte:0 "El Corte"
DOM_corte_desc:0 "'El Corte', The Cutting: with a bilateral solution seemingly beyond reach, we must take drastic action to cut away the most worrisome groups of foreign malcontents."
DOM_eternal_enemy:0 "Our Eternal Enemy"
DOM_eternal_enemy_desc:0 "Our fair Republic has always clashed with our neighbour to the west. From the time we arose from their subjugation with God Himself at our backs to today, Haiti has always shown disregard for our people and our nation's sovereignty. Let us put them in their place."
DOM_fate_haiti:0 "The Fate of Haiti"
DOM_fate_haiti_desc:0 "Haiti has been crushed beneath us, let us now decide what to do with them."
DOM_deescalate:0 "De-escalation"
DOM_deescalate_desc:0 "In spite of it all, and the once looming spectre of war, tensions of the border have begun to calm. Let us work with the Haitians towards a limit settlement, finalising the certain areas of the border while leaving other issues unaddressed."
DOM_aggressive_diplo:0 "Aggressive Diplomacy"
DOM_aggressive_diplo_desc:0 "Talks with Haiti to permanently end the turmoil in the borderland and settle territorial disputes in the Artibonite valley have stalled. With further effort, a aggressive rhetoric, and a small show of military might, perhaps they could be made more agreeable."
DOM_joint_assessment:0 "Joint Population Assessment"
DOM_joint_assessment_desc:0 "The population of the borderland has been infamously hard to assess for both our own nation and Haiti. As we have agreed, we must conduct a thorough joint assessment in preparation of a potential population exchange."
DOM_haiti_exchange:0 "The Exchange"
DOM_haiti_exchange_desc:0 "With the population of the borderlands properly assessed, let us exchange agreed upon settlements of importance and prepare to fully solve our mutual border dispute."
DOM_USwarmed:0 "American Mediation"
DOM_USwarmed_desc:0 "With the undeniable hegemon of both of our nations involved in settling the dispute, surely a solution can be reached."
DOM_border_treaty:0 "Settle Border Disputes"
DOM_border_treaty_desc:0 "The disputed territories along the Artibonite valley have been redrawn to our and Haiti's mutual satisfaction, let us formally exchange the land and put this whole nasty business behind us."

DOM_continue_modernization:0 "Continue Modernisation"
DOM_continue_modernization_desc:0 "After the end of the American Occupation, our nation began an ambitious army modernisation program. Unfortunately, that effort was cut short by the Great Depression. Let us at last bring our army into the modern age."
DOM_update_command_structure:0 "Update Command Structure"
DOM_update_command_structure_desc:0 "The Army's structure and role in society has evolved greatly since the end of our occupation, yet it still lacks many hallmarks of a modern military hierarchy and any comprehensive doctrine. If our army is to stand any chance in the field, we must begin to change this."
DOM_further_infequip_update:0 "Renewed Equipment Overhaul"
DOM_further_infequip_update_desc:0 "Our army still largely relies on Weltkrieg and American surplus for almost all of its equipment. The time to update has come."
DOM_conscription_debacle:0 "The Conscription Debacle"
DOM_conscription_debacle_desc:0 "Our nation is one of only handful in the world without conscription of any kind. This state of affairs has made our people complacent, and while they may at first be hesitant to see conscription implemented, surely like a doctor gives a patient vile medicine, this change is in the best interests of our nation."
DOM_specialized_army:0 "Martial Refinement"
DOM_specialized_army_desc:0 "As a small nation, we must always value military quality over quantity; commandos are the tip of the well-maintained sword that our army must strive to be, let us produce the most proficient commandos possible."
DOM_new_army:0 "A New Army"
DOM_new_army_desc:0 "The army can at last be expanded. While we still have momentum from our previous reforms, we should focus on training new divisions."
DOM_nco_reform:0 "Improved NCO Training"
DOM_nco_reform_desc:0 "Non-commissioned officers are very different in Europe than in our own country. The European model of professional and tactically proficient NCOs, while certainly difficult to attain is a standard we must nonetheless seek to emulate."
DOM_auxillary_forces:0 "Auxiliary Forces"
DOM_auxillary_forces_desc:0 "A great many of our people, while not suited to combat, could still be of use in war; we need not dedicate precious manpower to field hospitals or logistics when such people could easily fill those roles. Let us organise an auxiliary force specifically for such positions."
DOM_domestic_arms_industry:0 "Domestic Arms Industry"
DOM_domestic_arms_industry_desc:0 "In recent years, Dominican companies have made various forays into domestic arms development and with that, our nation has learned to produce sophisticated machine tools needed for arms production. These facilities should be put to work for the nation."
DOM_flexible_command:0 "Flexible Command"
DOM_flexible_command_desc:0 "Famously, German General Helmuth von Moltke the Elder wrote that 'No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.' This is no different in modern warfare; our command structure should always be capable of remaining intact despite setbacks and our plans always subject to refinement."
DOM_preemptive_capacity:0 "Preemptive Strike Capacity"
DOM_preemptive_capacity_desc:0 "The force which takes the initiative will always have upper hand. As our nation cannot afford to give ground in defence, initiative is even more important. Using modern technology, such as RADAR, our army can always be aware of an enemy's location and stand ready to attack."
DOM_modern_army:0 "Modern Army"
DOM_modern_army_desc:0 "The army has taken to our reforms well and operates more effectively and efficiently than ever before. At last, our nation has a truly modern army at its disposal."

DOM_naval_funding:0 "Naval Funding"
DOM_naval_funding_desc:0 "If the American Occupation proved anything, it is that our country is vulnerable by the sea. However, the navy has always played second fiddle to army and made do with minimal funding, even after the occupation's end. No more! The navy must have appropriate funding."
DOM_true_admirality:0 "A True Admiralty"
DOM_true_admirality_desc:0 "While the great naval powers of Europe have well developed admiralties and unique chains of command, our own navy relies mainly on army officers without any experience at the helm of a ship. We must completely reinvent our naval structure."
DOM_naval_infrastructure:0 "Naval Infrastructure"
DOM_naval_infrastructure_desc:0 "Warships require special facilities for their construction and upkeep, yet our own coastal cities have only civilian dockyards. We should build basic military naval facilities and infrastructure to supply them."
DOM_commission_flagship:0 "Commission Flagship"
DOM_commission_flagship_desc:0 "While we lack the industrial capacity to produce capital ships in significant number, many large ships have been recently decommissioned or are soon to meet that fate. Perhaps we could acquire one of these aging behemoths and completely retrofit it to serve as the pride of our own small navy."
DOM_retrofit:0 "Anti-Air Retrofitting"
DOM_retrofit_desc:0 "Aircraft have come to play an increasingly important role in naval combat, and all we have invested in our navy could be erased with a well-placed torpedo or bomb. Ships old and new must be equipped with sufficient anti-air armaments to guarantee their continued survival."
DOM_improve_interior_conditions:0 "Improve Sailor Conditions"
DOM_improve_interior_conditions_desc:0 "A happy sailor is a fighty sailor! Our men should not be confined to rusted bunk beds and horrid sanitation. The cabins of regular sailors must afford an agreeable standard of living or else be renovated."
DOM_integrate_merchants:0 "Integrate Merchant Ships"
DOM_integrate_merchants_desc:0 "In case of war, merchant ships would become the target of enemy air and naval attacks. All merchant ships flying under our flag must register with our navy and in times of war be directed by the naval administration to ensure both their safety and that of the navy."
DOM_fortify_shore:0 "Fortify Shoreline"
DOM_fortify_shore_desc:0 "On Hispaniola, we share but a single border, a single avenue for invasion; it is against this threat that most of our forces are dedicated. From the sea, however, our vulnerable gut is exposed to world. Our shores must be reinforced"
DOM_naval_research:0 "Maritime Research Institute"
DOM_naval_research_desc:0 "We must make a concerted effort to technologically 'catch-up' with the navies of the world. to accomplish this, we should found a central maritime research institute."
DOM_modern_PT:0 "Torpedo Boats"
DOM_modern_PT_desc:0 "From Europe, a new design has emerged. While most torpedo boats are small and operate close to shore, some navies have begun to field large torpedo boats equipped with anti-Submarine weapons. While larger than typical torpedo boats, these ships are still small and are easily produced. We should adopt such a design."
DOM_further_doctrine:0 "Further Our Doctrine"
DOM_further_doctrine_desc:0 "The navy has grown and to fully exploit its enlarged potential, we must further its doctrine."
DOM_new_generation:0 "New Blood"
DOM_new_generation_desc:0 "With greater funding and rapid expansion, the navy has at last endeared itself to the people. A new generation of children idolize the men who brave the seas for their country and interest in joining the navy has skyrocketed. In spite of this, naval recruitment remains tied to that of the army. We must do away with harmful state of affairs give the navy to new blood."

DOM_air_begin:0 "Aviation Overhaul"
DOM_air_begin_desc:0 "The air corps is new and novel, and its simple existence was enough to make military leaders rest on their laurels, assured things will progress on their own. In reality, it remains neglected and we have no more capacity to take the fight to the air than before its creation. It would be prudent to begin to work on expanding the air corps."
DOM_basing_advice:0 "Market Basing Rights"
DOM_basing_advice_desc:0 "We lack for understanding of aerial warfare, however an innovative idea has been proposed eliminate that issue. We could offer to whichever nations may wish to, basing rights for unarmed aircraft, and in exchange, nations agreeing to such would need only send a small attaché to help improve our air corps."
DOM_reorganize_air:0 "Reorganize The Air Corps"
DOM_reorganize_air_desc:0 "The Air Corps was established without proper understanding of how a new is established and lacks any direction to its operations. We must begin to reorganise and 'fine-tune' it."
DOM_combat_readiness:0 "Improve Readiness"
DOM_combat_readiness_desc:0 "An attack could come from anywhere and at any time. If we are not always prepared to take to the skies to meet an enemy as soon as they appear on the horizon, that war could be lost before it ever truly started. We should emulate the great powers of the world and always keep a number of planes armed, fueled, and on a rotating standby."
DOM_recon_aircraft:0 "Light Scout Craft"
DOM_recon_aircraft_desc:0 "From the air, enemy movements and positions are laid bare. With the support of small reconnaissance aircraft developed from retrofitted civilian planes, our soldiers on the ground will never be taken off guard."
DOM_air_academy:0 "Found Air Academy"
DOM_air_academy_desc:0 "The air corps currently must send most of its officer candidates abroad for education and training. While some nations might be content with this state of affairs, and indeed it is not abnormal, if we are ever to truly be in control of our own destiny, we must establish our own military aviation academy."
DOM_domestic_development:0 "Domestic Air Designs"

DOM_integration:0 "Unified Command Structure"
DOM_integration_desc:0 "The actions of one group of air corps officers are often disjointed and directly at odds with the actions of others. This disjointed mess prevents full coordination. Officers who refuse orders from higher-ups must not be given clemency any longer."
DOM_assure_aviation_fuel:0 "Assure Aviation Fuel Supply"
DOM_assure_aviation_fuel_desc:0 "The fuel used in aircraft is different from that of other vehicles and substantially more expensive to produce or acquire. As our nation has no domestic oil supply, we should look into both creating synthetic plane fuel and ensuring that our pilots are trained to conserve as much fuel as possible."
DOM_improve_anti_air:0 "Anti-Air Emplacements"
DOM_improve_anti_air_desc:0 "As our own air corps have expanded, the extent to which aircraft can affect the battlefield has become all too clear. We must never allow our skies to be stolen by an enemy; we need to invest in new anti-aircraft guns and emplacements."
DOM_seaplanes:0 "Seaplanes"
DOM_seaplanes_desc:0 "Even small ships are able to carry seaplanes to serve as reconnaissance craft which can locate enemy fleets and identify otherwise undetectable submarines. Any ship with the capacity should be retrofitted to carry such reconnaissance planes."
DOM_rule_the_skies:0 "Rule The Skies"
DOM_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The air corps has come far from its humble beginnings. While we may never be one of the preeminent powers of the world, at least, the skies above our nation are ours alone."

### Events ###
domrep.0.t:0 "A Troubling Time"
domrep.0.d:0 "From 1916 to 1924, the Dominican Republic was occupied by the United States. While the occupation was less severe than in neighbouring Haiti, the country was nonetheless transformed. The old political establishment was turned on its head and the centre-left completely destroyed; much power was granted by the occupiers to power-hungry military leaders, especially the ambitious Rafael Trujillo.\nA new democratic constitution was drafted in 1924 and the nation regained its independence soon after, with full financial control being returned by the Americans a few years later. Initially, the new nation prospered and its institutions were rebuilt; however, this would not last for long. President Horacio Vásquez attempted to change the constitution for his own gain, and while he was narrowly forced out by Vice President Federico Velázquez, the nation's democracy was forever weakened. After several lackluster presidencies from the ranks of the Red party, the conservative populist Virgilio Martínez Reyna defeated the pro-business Rafael Estrella Ureña in a campaign which would shatter the Red party and further hindered the recovery of national stability. While President Martínez is popular with the lower classes, his steady centralisation of power and willingness to change the constitution, eerily similar to the actions of Vásquez himself, have alienated the wealthy. With the next election rapidly approaching, perhaps desperation could precipitate upheaval."
domrep.0.a:0 "Onwards!"

domrep.1.t:0 "A Clandestine Meeting"
domrep.1.d:0 "In a nondescript building on the edge of Santo Domingo, two of the most powerful men in the Dominican Republic sit around a table. Rafael Estrella Ureña, candidate in the upcoming Presidential Election and head of the Republicano party, and Rafael Trujillo Molina, Chief of the Armed Forces - both seeking the same increasingly scarce commodity: power. The two men have entirely different visions for the country, however, and in the short time since the meeting began, Estrella has become increasingly wary of Trujillo and the role that is demanded of him should they endeavour to take power together."
domrep.1.a:0 "Estrella Storms Out."
domrep.1.b:0 "A Deal Is Reached."

domrep.2.t:0 "Republicano Coup"
domrep.2.d:0 "Today in Santo Domingo, what many had feared has become reality. Fanatic armed supporters of Estrella have entered the city and occupied many government buildings. Meanwhile, the army under Rafael Trujillo has refused to leave their barracks, with Trujillo treasonously claiming to be 'neutral' in regards to the attempted coup. Some of the city's police force, however, and many supporters of President Reyna have also come out in droves to fight the coup."
domrep.2.a:0 "The Instigators Are Dispersed."
domrep.2.b:0 "The Capital Is Occupied."

domrep.3.t:0 "Presidential Election"
domrep.3.d_1:0 "At last, the long awaited Presidential Election has arrived, ballots have been cast across the nation and results are already being counted. While some feared that Martínez may attempt to undermine the integrity of the election with his authority, the process so far seems to be entirely valid. Now the only question is who the winner shall be."
domrep.3.d_2:0 "With the failure of Estrella and the Republicanos' attempted coup, Martínez now commands an insurmountable lead over the only other candidate with any substantial following, Manuel Troncoso Concha, who is widely considered to be a puppet of General Rafael Trujillo Molina, himself having fallen out of popular favour and reduced in political significance as a result of his refusal to quell the attempted coup - an act for which many demand Trujillo be tried before a court of law."
domrep.3.a:0 "Martínez Secures Another Term."
domrep.3.b:0 "Estrella Takes It."

domrep.4.t:0 "Estrella's Dilemma"
domrep.4.d:0 "Though at first smitten with his newfound power, President Estrella quickly found General Trujillo to be an even more aggravating ally than Martínez was an enemy. Beyond that, Trujillo has all but confirmed that he intends to partially renege on the agreement which precipitated the coup. Namely, he intends not to allow Estrella to stand for the next (entirely rigged) Presidential election. While Trujillo may now hold much political power, Estrella's supporters have likewise grown in strength and it may be feasible for Estrella to attempt to resist Trujillo and take control of the country himself."
domrep.4.a:0 "Estrella Resists."
domrep.4.b:0 "Estrella Gives In."

domrep.5.t:0 "Estrella's Term At An End"
domrep.5.d:0 "Rafael Estrella Ureña's time as provisional President is now at an end. A show election has been held where Trujillo's handpicked candidate, Manuel Troncoso Concha, was the only option on the ballot. While Estrella may have had some degree of independence from Trujillo, Troncoso is considered to be but a mere puppet, with all political power now lying in the hands of either Trujillo himself or the military in general."
domrep.5.a:0 "Trujillo is Now President in All But Name."

domrep.6.t:0 "Estrella Replaces Trujillo's Appointees"
domrep.6.d:0 "Convinced that he can indeed defeat Trujillo in a power struggle, President Estrella has dismissed figures within his cabinet originally appointed at Trujillo's behest. Trujillo will certainly respond to this slight, though the extent to which he will reprimand Estrella is yet to be seen."
domrep.6.a:0 "So It Begins."

domrep.7.t:0 "Allies No Longer"
domrep.7.d:0 "During a sizable rally of Republicano supporters, mostly from the upper classes, the small police contingent supervising the event suddenly found itself inundated with belligerent soldiers clearly loyal to Trujillo. It became clear soon thereafter that those soldiers were but a small contingent of the many that had entered the city to take control over the civilian government. Just as when Martínez was unceremoniously ejected from the from government, city workers including police, remain largely loyal to the civilian administration and popular opinion is firmly against Trujillo's latest power grab."
domrep.7.a:0 "The Soldiers Disperse."
domrep.7.b:0 "Trujillo Takes The Government."

domrep.8.t:0 "Black Monday in the Dominican Republic"
domrep.8.d:0 "Our nation's tentative recovery from the American Great Depression has fallen apart with the collapse of the German Economy following Black Monday. It seems our country is in for yet more economic hardship."
domrep.8.a:0 "Surely the Economy Cannot Get Even Worse?"

domrep.9.t:0 "The Constitutional Assembly Convenes"
domrep.9.d:0 "The Constitutional Assembly is often considered by outside observers to be the upper-house of the supposedly bicameral legislature of the country, and indeed the Assembly does approve or reject legislation passed by the lower-house known as the 'Congress'. It's role, however, is much greater than that. Upon a Presidential decree, the Assembly can be convened to amend the Constitution or even replace it entirely.\nNow, with President Martínez's decree and the agenda for this special session of the Assembly finalised, the Assembly has convened. The order of the day is to overhaul the Dominican Constitution. To what degree the document will be modified, or if it will even be replaced entirely remains to be seen.\nWhile so far small changes have been agreed to, one particular issue has caused much disagreement among the members of the Assembly. That being that given the political manoeuvring of the military, whether or not the military should be moved to a so-called Constitutional Department. Such a move would place the actions of the military under constant review by the Assembly in the future to assure that all of its actions, no matter how small, agree in full with the Constitution. While obviously doing so would restrain the military, it would also add a new layer of bureaucracy to it and possibly prevent decisive action in times of crisis."
domrep.9.a:0 "The Armed Forces Must Be Independent."
domrep.9.b:0 "The Military Should Be Constrained."

domrep.10.t:0 "Constitutional Convention Issue Two"
domrep.10.d:0 "With pressure mounting and no clear successor having emerged, President Martínez with the shaky approval of the Constitutional Assembly was allowed to run for a second term following the narrow passage of a new amendment. Many Assemblymen and citizens alike wish to see this change undone and a new amendment passed specifying that the one term limit is immutable. Others believe that the potential for re-election should remain and itself be more fully written into the constitution. This divide has stalled the constitutional convention yet again and could be narrowly resolved in either direction."

domrep.11.t:0 "Constitutional Convention Issue Three"
domrep.11.d:0 "Just as the convention seemed all but concluded, yet another contentious issue arose. In other countries, the executive is almost the sole fiduciary of the state, wielding great power to direct the nation financially. In our own country, however, the financial duties of the President are quite limited. Many argue that this exacerbated the Great Depression and stalled our response to the devastating hurricane of 1930. Should the financial powers of the President be expanded?"

domrep.12.t:0 "The Trial"
domrep.12.d_1:0 "While the rumors of a potential coup attempt prior to the election were unfounded, evidence of General Trujillo's disloyalty abounds. Today, after a week of detention by forces loyal only to the President himself, Trujillo has been brought before a criminal court in Santo Domingo on charges of treason. While some would like to see Trujillo rot in prison for the remainder of his life, others argue that the whole affair is so transparently farcical and he should only be stripped of his command and nothing more."
domrep.12.d_2:0 "The coup failed, but the country is still rife with supporters of Trujillo and those among the elite who would still back Estrella. As the two men were dragged before a court in Santo Domingo today, the president himself seemed consumed by anxiety over whether to intervene in the trial. While the court will surely sentence both men harshly, their supporters may only become dangerously desperate in that case. Perhaps, with presidential intervention, the men could be given lighter sentence and avoid such turmoil."

domrep.13.t:0 "Righting The Betrayal"
domrep.13.d_1:0 "Following the failure of his attempted coup, General Trujillo fled into the borderlands along with his most loyal followers. A small number of his lieutenant had reached out to our government shortly after the flight offering to deliver Trujillo to us for his inevitable execution in return for clemency. Today, he is to meet his fate."
domrep.13.d_2:0 "Through winning the presidential election, President Estrella now must confront the man with whom he once plotted a coup. Surely, Estrella reasons, if Trujillo would attempt to orchestrate one coup, he would definitely do so twice, despite the collapse of the first. An assassin's bullet will surely do the trick."

domrep.14.t:0 "A Winning Move?"
domrep.14.d:0 "President Estrella's connections to the nation's economic elite allowed him to seriously challenge his rivals within the Rojo party, and eventually break away entirely. Since his rise to power, his former backers have become increasingly angry with their not seeing any support from the new administration. Unwilling to make good on his promises of deep economic concessions, Estrella has been searching for a way out of his predicament. Like a game of chess, he has begun to mobilise all his pieces, all those who are loyal strictly to him, for one decisive move to corner his opponents."
domrep.14.a:0 "Offer A Draw."
domrep.14.b:0 "Checkmate."

domrep.15.t:0 "The New Regime"
domrep.15.d:0 "Since Estrella's departure from the presidency, our nation's political structure has become increasingly convoluted, with various aspects of the civilian government being sufficiently, but not entirely, subverted by the military. From this, a peculiar situation has developed, where, in spite of Trujillo's dominant position, other military leaders have begun to act like warlords in the military districts in which they operate, with Trujillo becoming akin to a crime boss, loosely lording over them. General Trujillo has recognised that this sorry state of affairs must come to an end; where there is jurisdictional overlap, some must be dismissed from their posts, where some commanders grow too big for their britches, they must be forcibly removed, and the Presidency can no longer be simply provisional. Whether Troncoso should continue to serve, or Trujillo should simply assume the position earlier than previously planned, is still a matter of debate, however."
domrep.15.a:0 "Keep Manuel Troncoso."
domrep.15.b:0 "Appoint Trujillo Early."

domrep.16.t:0 "A Diligent Bureaucracy"
domrep.16.d:0 "Disloyalty from those in the bureaucracy has already become an administrative burden, and the issue is sure to only grow if nothing is done. While those in our government have agreed on what to do to combat the problem, that being the creation of a new state security agency to root out troublemakers, the method of implementation is far more contentious. On one hand, some, especially those civilians who have thrown their lot in with the military, argue that the new agency should be a formal bureaucratic department, those within the military are split over whether to create a similar agency under the auspices of the armed forces alone, or to formalise Trujillo's already established 42 agency."

domrep.17.d:0 "Disillusionment from within is an unfortunate reality of politics. Of course, such people, who are ultimately good but have gone astray, are pitied. The question is then, how can they be righted again? It is clear that the solution is institutional and should come with our reforms of the bureaucracy. To that, we could either attempt to aggressively promote the just nature of our government through mandatory re-education whenever necessary, simply rely on redoubled martial discipline, or task our new security service with bringing such people into line."

domrep.17.b:0 "Further Improve Discipline."
domrep.17.c:0 "Use The Security Service."

domrep.18.t:0 "A Militarised Economy?"
domrep.18.d:0 "The armed forces are remarkably good at eliminating waste through discipline, similarly, many within the armed forces, including General Trujillo argue that the country as a whole should be run in a similar way. That being, regulation should focus not on individual economic issues, nor should the economic bureaucracy attempt to control minutia, indeed such only causes economic harm, rather the basic economic behaviour of society and individuals must be aggressively molded. The same all-encompassing hierarchy with its order and rigid discipline must be reflected across the entire nation."
domrep.18.a:0 "This Is A Bad Idea."
domrep.18.b:0 "Do It."

domrep.19.t:0 "Reorganising the Foreign Ministry"
domrep.19.d:0 "Diplomats abroad have so far largely been unaffected by our regime's ascendance, and many undoubtedly are sympathetic to our opposition. While the need to replace most of these diplomats is apparent, how this should be done is a matter of debate. Some argue that the transition should be gradual, with promises made to our diplomats ensuring the security of their positions and asking only for loyalty and that they faithfully carry out their duties. Others suggest that the entire diplomatic core should be reorganised so as to elevate those whose loyalties are assured and marginalise those suspected of harbouring dissenting ideas. Trujillo and his supporters suggest that nothing less than total loyalty is acceptable and any and all diplomats with murky loyalties should be dismissed and their country of residence petitioned for their extradition."

domrep.20.t:0 "Finding a Solution"
domrep.20.d:0 "Many of the nation's most prominent families and individuals remain staunchly opposed to our government, especially given our treatment of Estrella, a man deeply in their pockets. Indeed, military men are cut from a different cloth than the country's traditional ruling class, and they will not stand to be unceremoniously replaced. Some, however, are open to collaboration with our regime, and indeed, many prominent lawyers and businessmen do owe our regime their loyalty already. What approach should be taken in settling this issue?"
domrep.20.a:0 "Reconciliation."
domrep.20.b:0 "Degradation."
domrep.20.c:0 "Annihilation."

domrep.21.t:0 "Entrench the Party"

domrep.21.c:0 "Institutionalise It."

domrep.22.t:0 "Awash With Light"
domrep.22.d:0 "Our nation sorely lags behind the rest of the world in electrification. As emerging technologies and industries rely heavily on electrical power, it is pertinent that the gap be closed immediately. While Trujillo has argued for substantial state investment in the process, the sheer cost of such an endeavour has thrown many others for a loop. Alternative proposals to cut costs by working with various industrial concerns throughout the country to create a privatised electric grid, or to focus on electrifying military installations and state-owned industries first have been made in response."
domrep.22.a:0 "Side With Business Interests."
domrep.22.b:0 "The Military Comes First."
domrep.22.c:0 "Trujillo Makes A Good Point."

domrep.23.t:0 "Electrification Finished"
domrep.23.d_1:0 "Through generous incentive packages, backroom meetings, and shady informal cash transfers, the nation's industrial concerns were made to immediately shift their focus to the construction of a new electrical grid. The new privatised system, while cost effective, cannot be fully utilised by the state. Regardless, the new electrical grid has already been a boon to the state, the people, and private enterprise alike."
domrep.23.d_2:0 "The military must always come first, and today, the grandest monument to that dominance has been completed. A new electrical grid was hastily constructed by bands of army work brigades, linking various military installations and government buildings throughout the country. Many rural areas, however, remain entirely without power as the cost was simply to great."
domrep.23.d_3:0 "Due largely to our sizable financial commitment, the electrification process was a total success, finishing on schedule and to the satisfaction of all levels of society. The cost was steep, but it seems to have been fully worth the investment."

domrep.27.d_1:0 "Without some degree of democracy, the people are sure to become increasingly unruly. To avoid that inevitability, even the highest office must be elected. Any candidate, however, must not just be acceptable, but drawn from the highest ranks of the party. To that end, two candidates have been approved for the election, Pilindo Bonetti Burgos, a lawyer and cultural icon, and General Ramon Vasquez Rivera, both under the banner of the Dominican Party."
domrep.27.d_2:0 "While some proposed to do away with the often troublesome legislative branch and perhaps any semblance of democracy entirely, the cost of such a move was simply too great. To lend legitimacy to our government, elections for the Presidency have been organised. While originally, General Ramon Vasquez Rivera was to run unopposed with Trujillo's consent, Trujillo, soon thereafter decided to announce his own candidacy, much to the chagrin of other officers wary of his still somewhat dominant positions both in civilian and military affairs."

To avoid a new occupation, we need a navy able to go toe to toe, for a short time at least, with the great powers and hold its own. To accomplish this, we could, as has been advocated by many in our growing navy, to build a flagship from the husk of whatever outdated behemoth we can acquire to retrofit as the lynchpin of the new fleet, a dreadnought of our own. This, however, while enticing, idea would undoubtedly be extremely costly and require our entire economic apparatus to pivot, and potentially have long-lasting financial effects."

While Haiti has yet to respond to the incident, information will surely reach them in a matter of days, possibly less, and how we treat the men who committed these acts will have diplomatic repercussions. President Martínez, while like any self-respecting Dominican wary of Haiti and its people, wishes to discipline the men and attempt to discourage similar incidents in the future, however, national pride and the advice to the contrary from those within his party and cabinet have caused in him a great deal of indecision."

While the Dominican proposed exchange of populations is simply unfeasible without the full cooperation of both nations on the island, we can either choose to support those migrants already in the Dominican Republic and force the Dominicans to pay reparations for the Monte Cristi affair, or instead or Haiti to work to stop the flow of migrants."

To them, and to the Dominicans as well, mere condemnation will be as good as having backed down from the conflict entirely.

domrep.97.t:0 "Preparations Completed"
domrep.97.d:0 "With our intent to declare war upon the Dominican Republic declared, our nation set to work to secretly begin preparations for a full scale invasion of the Dominican Republic. These preparations were completed and the rebels in the Dominican Republic given word to wait for an official declaration of war to begin their uprising. Today, that declaration has been issued. We must act fast, however, as the element of surprise has been lost and our carefully prepared invasion plan may quickly become useless as the Dominicans strengthen their defenses."

domrep.98.t:0 "Costa Rica Declares War"
domrep.98.d:0 "The lack of a Costa Rican response to our attempt on President Ferrer's life had puzzled many in our regime, but most had begun to write it off as simply good fortune. Unfortunately, Costa Rica has now responded, and by war declaration at that. Had Costa Rica's declaration of war been the only bad news to reach the capital today, that would have been more than enough to set our government into a panic, but worse still, it seems that a force of rebels has risen in conjunction with their announcement, pledging loyalty to President Ferrer against our supposedly 'tyrannical' regime."
domrep.98.a:0 "Horrid!"

domrep.99.t:0 "Costa Rica Declares War"
domrep.99.d_1:0 "As part of its crusade against supposed 'dictators' throughout Central America and the Caribbean, Costa Rica had become increasingly hostile to our diplomatic efforts. While word of their intent to declare war had reached Santo Domingo days ago, the reports were dismissed as unfounded rumors. Surely that fool Ferrer would not attempt such a thing? Alas, today a declaration of war has been issued, our nation is now in open conflict with Costa Rica."
domrep.99.d_2:0 "While Costa Rica never responded with outrage at the attempt on President Ferrer's life as many had feared, it seems that particular impasse was not forgiven. Costa Rica has issued a declaration of war against our nation, citing both the assassination attempt and despotic nature of our regime. Had Costa Rica's declaration of war been the only bad news to reach the capital today, that would have been more than enough to set our government into a panic, but worse still, it seems that a force of rebels have risen in conjunction with their announcement, pledging loyalty to President Ferrer against our supposedly 'tyrannical' regime."

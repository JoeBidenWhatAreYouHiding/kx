### Events ###

uga.1.t:0 "Uganda Breaks off"
uga.1.d:0 "The traitorous dogs to the south in Uganda have stabbed us in the back today with their declaration of secession from the joint Kenya-Ugandan colonial experiment. The dogs in Kampala have decided to go their own way in the wake of growing instability and the imminent collapse of Mittelafrika. Though their future is far from certain, the government in Kampala has declared that a future they can decide is a far better future than the alternative, which would be licking the German boot like the snakes in Nairobi. The great union of Kenyans and Ugandans dissolves today, and with it, the north of Mittelafrika falls into chaos."
uga.1.a:0 "Traitors!"

uga.2.t:0 "Rothschild Takes over Uganda"
uga.2.d:0 "With Uganda’s recent secession from their former brothers in Kenya, a peculiar turn of events has transpired. Under the direction of family patriarch Lionel de Rothschild, the affluent and infamous Rothschild family has stepped into the newly freed state, seeking to carve out a new Jewish homeland on the Dark Continent. Renaming the region as the “State of Israel-Uganda,” the Rothschilds are poised to create a new Promised Land for God’s Chosen. As the caustic cauldron of Mittelafrika threatens to boil over, whether or not this odd little state survives the brewing chaos remains to be seen, but under Lionel de Rothschild’s guiding hand, the future of both Ugandans and Jews seem brighter than ever before in this new Land of Milk and Honey."
uga.2.a:0 "For the Rothschilds!"
uga.2.b:0 "The Rothschilds are pushed back and the Kingdom of Buganda Survives!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_LEONIDAS_MATOS_DESC:0 "Leônidas Antero de Mattos is a native of Cuiabá, born in 1894 and as all so usual for the upper class then, graduated in law school before moving into politics, while his brother João Antero de Mattos joined the military. A staple figure in state governments of Mato Grosso since the Interstate War, he has been awarded many varying stations and administrative positions, some say all the while lining his pockets. While the role of leading the newly founded Republic of Goyaz is an unpleasant one, especially with the powerful Caiado family jostling for power constantly, Leonidas certainly believes that cooperation, at least for now, is the best way to ensure the prosperity of his home."
POLITICS_RAMIRO_NORONHA_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "While a relatively low ranking officer before the beginning of hostilities, Ramiro Noronha has since established himself as one of the most well known service men in the lands now controlled by Goyaz. As to seek a quick pacification of the hinterlands, his expertise as many times garrison leader and interventor in the region is now at the service of the newly founded republic, in a role that he certainly did not predict when he enrolled into military service as a young man. Now having to deal with grumbling oligarchs and syndicalist protests, Noronha himself fears he may not be entirely qualified to the task laid before him, but is determined to establish order first, before any reconsidering of strategic options."
POLITICS_JARI_GOMES_GOY_DESC:0 "Born in 1913 in the riverine city of Corumbá, Jari Gomes graduated in medical school, but has been more active as a poet and politician since then. After following the all to familiar climb of city councillor, state and then federal representative, Jari is one of the most influential politicians in what is now the Goyaz Republic, and has been chosen as it's first president, in a move some claim is a direct attempt to curtail the influence of the Caiado family in regional politics. The stage is set for a new chapter in the ever changing landscape of this land's politics, and few can predict if President Jari will come out on top internally, but his foreign backing certainly has most oppositors moving cautiously."
POLITICS_TOTO_CAIADO_DESC:0 "The recent political history of the state, and then the Republic of Goyaz is almost entirely the history of the extremely wealthy and powerful Caiado family, and those few and brave enough to oppose their immense political power. Even as it transitioned into an independent nation, Antônio José Caiado, also known as Totó, is by far the most powerful man in the land, as the head of the family and all its properties and influence. While some could call dealing with foreign occupiers dubious, there are few things the family would not do to maintain its grip on local politics, which has admittedly weakened ever since the democratic reforms in the wake of the interstate war. Now assuming direct control of government and with powerful foreign backers, few can even see a future where the Caiados don't rule Goyaz."
POLITICS_CANDIDO_RONDON_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "Almost a living legend in Goyaz's northern reaches, and all of the former Brazilian lands as a whole, Candido Rondon is a die hard republican who spent decades of effort to connect, explore and map the large western reaches of Brazil. Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon knows these lands better than any man ever has in history, and he will not give up the fight for his republican values, even in the dire situation all of former Brazil finds itself in. Some, however, claim him to be broken and tired man, that gave up his fighting spirit for the safety of the people in the region."
POLITICS_CHICO_AQUINO_GOY_DESC:0 "His Revered Excellency Francisco de Aquino Correia was born in 1885 in Cuiabá, and is the chief religious authority and intellectual in the region. Having dabbled in politics since 1917, Francisco knows that the role of the church in the hinterlands is more than a spiritual one, but one of guidance and guard against the ever present threats of the material world, such as the temptation of atheism and discrimination. While he was at a point had something of a common cause with integralists in Brazil, his relative lack of enthusiasm for the monarchist movement caused him to fall into the wayside of that movement, but has since admitted that dealing with those radicals was a mistake borne of fears of a rise in syndicalism. While he is respected among both the people and his peers, he will have much to endeavour in stabilizing the newly established republic, especially when it comes to curbing the ever growing influence of the Caiado family of the capital."
POLITICS_PEDRO_LUDOVICO_GOY_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Goyaz, Pedro Ludovico Teixeira completed his studies in Rio de Janeiro before returning to his home, where quickly began a political career, positioning himself against the state oligarchs, the Caiado family. While initially left leaning politically, the failures of the ED and the street violence that even reached his city during the 1936 elections have drifted him towards a more liberal-democratic point of view. His main goal while at the helm of the republic is one that has defined his political career, his long standing desire for a better and more developed Goyaz, even if his ideas on how to reach said goal have changed quite a bit over the years. As he now takes the helm of an independent and free Goyaz, he can finally set his development plans into motion, and while some powerful families will likely stand in his way, naturally including the Caiado, he has confidence that his foreign backing gives him a secure position to negotiate."
POLITICS_PONCE_ARRUDA_GOY_DESC:0 "A civil engineer by trade, João Ponce de Arruda is not exactly the kind of man who typically takes on the protagonist role in socialist states. While he always was a left winger, he never saw himself as a radical, but as a moderate, and this position and his influence in the region have allowed himself to present himself as the best possible head for a transitional government as the newly established republic gets back on its feet, as the war demolished what little infrastructure remained. Born in Cuiabá in 1904, he also both blood and friendship ties to many of the states notables, and seeks to ensure a stable transition; but many of the powerful families in the region still believe themselves in a position above the new government, which is bound to cause issues for the young nation."
POLITICS_APOLLONIO_GOY_DESC:0 "Apolônio de Carvalho is one of the most notable military servicemen to have joined political life in the left wing, having had a long and distinguished career in the Brazilian military after he left his home in Corumbá to serve. He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. With the war that devastated the former nation now in the past, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left-leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country must be done in a swift and decisive fashion, and not doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the newborn republic. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army. As a military man, he also believes in a proactive foreign policy to safeguard the interests of world revolution."
POLITICS_HEITOR_LIMA_GOY_DESC:0 "Heitor Ferreira Lima was born in the city of Corumbá in Mato Grosso, but he moved to Rio de Janeiro while still relatively young, in 1922. He started working as a tailor and joined the local syndicalist movements, and became one of the three youngsters chosen there to study in Paris under the auspices of the Third Internationale. There he turned into a true scholar of economic and social theory, and has since dedicated his life for the workers of the world. Now tasked with the role of leading his birthplace to a better future, he has to face off not only against the elements, but the quasi-feudal resistance against any kind of modernization efforts that is well entrenched within the newly formed state. However, the internationalist nature of the man means he will not hesitate to call in foreign help to deal with any open unrest, a fact the wisest members of the opposition to the communard government recently established have to always keep in mind."

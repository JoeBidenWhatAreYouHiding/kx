### Sub-ideologies ###

BAT_social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "The Baltic German Democratic Party follows the ideological thought of Paul Schiemann, which can best be described as meritocratic liberalism. It worships the inherent human rights of the individual and equality of opportunity no matter one's religion, nationality or social standing. However, this does not equate to equality of outcome, nor equal political rights - the right to rule should be reserved to those who have the merit and ability to rule, and educated individuals should have inherently more political rights than the uneducated lower masses. Meritocratic liberalism seeks to establish a corporatist, meritocratic political system where the government is composed of delegates from all social groups and political professionals, and it believes in the enlightening mission of the government - its goal should be to create a free, educated, culturally enlightened society, and thus give anyone the ability to rise through the meritocratic ranks."
BAT_national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "The Baltic Brotherhood follows its own firebrand ideology, an eclectic mutation of radical Christianity and Baltic German exceptionalism. It is a millenarian religious movement which proclaims a new reading of the Bible and calls for a restoration of Christian morality across all of Europe. In the Baltic German nation, it sees a history of religious warfare and stalwart faith, and so believes that their purpose is to champion this rebirth of Christianity in the face of Eastern and Syndicalist onslaught. Fanatically loyal to pan-Germanism, the Brotherhood believes that Germany's role should be to lead Europe in this crusade, and so its goal is to turn the Baltics into a model province for the 'National Revival', from where the flame can be brought to Germany. In practice, its regime is totalitarian, fanatically dedicated to Christian ideals, and heavily militaristic."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ADOLF_FRIEDRICH_DESC:0 "Once could hardly find a place in the world which Adolf Friedrich, the first and only Duke of the United Baltic Duchy, has not seen. An erudite, veteran of the Prussian Cuirassiers, a passionate hunter and an avid car racer, he's undertaken personal pilgrimages to the Middle East, East Asia and Africa, travelling thousands of kilometers on foot and horseback, throughout most of his life. Africa and its lush wildlife hold a special place in his heart, however - he's crossed Africa from east to west, left his name upon a volcano in Tanganyika, and ultimately landed a job as the Governor of Togoland before the Weltkrieg. While definitely not a soft administrator, Adolf Friedrich displayed great interest in the lives and culture of the Togolese natives, even taking the time to learn the Ewe language. \n\nAt the end of the Weltkrieg, his experience as a colonial governor and great prestige among the German upper class led to Adolf von Pilchau's Regency Council offering the throne of the United Baltic Duchy to him. Adolf Friedrich agreed and arrived to Riga in spring of 1919, where he announced that he shall safeguard the ancient rights and privileges of the Baltic nobility and do everything in his power to be a good ruler. For the most part, Duke Adolf Friedrich is a passive monarch who dedicates his institution to patronage of the arts, sciences, and sports. He's been recognized as the best racecar driver in the entire Duchy, surpassing all of his fellow fans of the sport. Years of experience have given him plenty of political acumen, however, and, recognizing the weakness of his new realm, he's begun to speak out more often, expressing the need for reform."

POLITICS_WILHELM_MUNTER_DESC:0 "Gotthard Wilhelm Nikolai Munter was born to a mixed Estonian-Baltic German middle class family in Riga, and grew up during the last days of the Russian Empire. Alongside the rest of the Riga Polytechnic, he was evacuated to Russia, and later recruited into the Imperial Russian Army. Inducted into the Cadet Corps, Munter was among the first to resist the October Revolution in Petrograd, but the sheer numbers of the revolutionaries proved too much to resist. The German soldier was imprisoned, but managed to escape through connections and escape to the Baltics, where he returned to German-occupied Riga. There, having finally found rest, Munter completed his studies in chemistry and applied to join the foreign office of the United Baltic Duchy. Throughout the post-Weltkrieg period, he became increasingly drawn to the Democratic Party and its reformist ideals, and though he never officially became a member, he became regarded as the leader of its liberal coalition in Riga.\n\nPersonality wise, Munter has been almost universally regarded as ambitious, unprincipled, and with an affinity towards intrigue. Lacking social tact and softness, he often considers sentiment to be foreign to him. To Munter, emotional people are weak, insignificant dreamers and everyone he meets can only be classified into two categories - those who are useful and those who are useless. His opponents are numerous, but even those who know him well doubt he has any friends at all."
POLITICS_SCHEUBNER_RICHTER_DESC:0 "Ludwig Maximilian Erwin Richter was born to a German musician in Riga, and added the second last name "Scheubner" after marrying into a family of Baltic German nobility and getting adopted by one of his wife's relatives, in an old German form of having one's lineage ennobled. Though he first lived in Russia, Scheubner-Richter ended up moving to Munich to complete his chemistry studies, and volunteered for the army of his new homeland when the Weltkrieg began. However, he did not serve on the front lines for long - once his superiors caught note of his Russian fluency, Scheubner-Richter was removed from the front and sent to the Ottoman Empire for a secret mission to infiltrate the Russian oil fields, under the guise of a consulate in Erzurum. Though the infiltration never took off, Scheubner-Richter witnessed the Armenian Genocide instead, and became one of the first to report about the atrocities, which he described as "a policy of annihilation fueled by racial hatred".\n\nScheubner-Richter returned to the Baltics a lieutenant and an officer in the Baltische Landeswehr, and retired from service in 1920 to settle in Riga, where he found work in the city press and maintained contact with his connections to both German and Baltic nationalists. To the dismay of his classmate Otto von Kursell, Scheubner-Richter did not end up involved in the Baltic Brotherhood, but the wartime years had turned him into just as much of a nationalist regardless. A conservative and a monarchist dismissive of democracy and vehemently against socialism, Scheubner-Richter calls in his "Deutschen Manifest" for the birth of a "new nationalism", one which is based upon the interest of the national community and one which will unite all Germans into one pan-Germanic state."
POLITICS_HELMUTH_STEGMAN_DESC:0 "Born to a former senior surveyor of the city of Riga, firmly in the urban middle class of the Baltic German nation, Helmuth Stegman acquired an education in law during the dying days of the Russian Empire and worked as a civil servant in his home town during the German occupation. The foundation of the United Baltic Duchy did little to affect his career - he acquired the lawyer's license he wanted, worked both as a lawyer and a judge, and advanced to the Riga City Council. A political party gathered itself around him, the Baltic German State Party, a legalistic conservative movement limited to the city of Riga, yet mobilizing a large portion of the upper and middle class electorate there - eventually, it propelled him to the position of Mayor, a position he's held for the past several years.\n\nA legalistic mind, Stegman believed in thorough reform to the Baltic Duchy according to the rule of law - throughout the years, he has submitted several projects for a constitution to the Duchy, and though none of them were approved, Riga would serve as the ground for experimentation. He reformed the horrific landscape of the Rigan legal system, ushered in a sense of stability and brought greater popular representation to the Rigaer Rat, granting him the respect of the people and allowing Riga to course through the collapse of the Duchy in one piece. A besieged, isolated Riga is something he could not predict, however - and as the greatest challenge to the Baltic German nation arises, the Mayor is forced to put on a stern frown and guide its remnant, promising a bright tomorrow despite the fear in his heart."
POLITICS_RUDIGER_VON_DER_GOLTZ_LEADER_DESC:0 "The Graf von der Goltz is the most powerful a non-Baltic German has ever managed to become in the United Baltic Duchy, arguably even greater than Duke Adolf Friedrich himself. A descendant of a honored Prussian noble family with a history of military officers, von der Goltz had a long and bountiful career in the Imperial German Army even before the Weltkrieg, during which he was a division commander respected on the Western and Eastern Fronts alike. In 1918, he became the General Staff's primary asset in relations with its Eastern regions - early that year, he was sent to Finland as a representative of the German forces and promptly took control of the state as a dictator. When that became untenable, he was reassigned to the Baltic Duchy, where he laid down the foundations for the Baltische Landeswehr. The army of the Duchy owes everything to von der Goltz, and he knows that. \n\nAn aristocrat by blood and personality, the Graf has little patience for democracy and the squabbling liberals in the Landtag. While many of his fellow German veterans who helped found the Baltische Landeswehr ultimately returned to Germany, von der Goltz stayed, knowing that not only will the Duchy require his services yet again, but that he will be able to take advantage of the situation and finally rise beyond a mere chief of staff of the Landeswehr."

He continued to rapidly rise through the ranks of the military in the following years, becoming a trusted accomplice of Graf von der Goltz and a respected commander in his own right.

After fighting in the Weltkrieg, he returned to the family estate in Estonia in 1917, only to be swept up by the Estonian War of Independence. von Weiss volunteered for the Landeswehr and commanded forces against the Estonians during the last months of the war, then decided to stay in the army a little longer.

Upon the breakout of the Weltkrieg, he, a student in Heidelberg, Germany, chose to enroll for the Imperial German Army, despite his nation's allegiance to Russia at the time, and achieved the rank of Lieutenant in the Bavarian Uhlans. Thanks to this experience and clear loyalty to the German cause, he became one of the first members of the General Staff of the Baltische Landeswehr in November of 1918. An active, reckless leader, he commanded an elite unit of Weltkrieg veterans against the Estonian and Latvian rebellions, often leading his men from the front lines without an ounce of hesitation. \n\nBy the end of the war, Manteuffel's prestige among the Baltic Germans was untold and his status as a war hero cemented. Manteuffel himself took a lunge towards the far right, however. Invited by his brother Georg, a member of the organization's inner circle, he was inducted into the Baltic Brotherhood, and turned into a devout follower of its nationalist, pan-German, and reactionary beliefs. To the Brotherhood, he is an example of the legacy of Teutonic knighthood remaining to this day, a real hero on the battlefield. It remains to be seen whether Manteuffel gets to propel his Brothers into the power they always desired..."

KRBAT.1.t:0 "The United Baltic Duchy"
KRBAT.1.d:0 "Standing on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, the United Baltic Duchy is the easternmost Germanic state in Europe, formed in 1918 with the initiative of the local Baltic German population. Though initially imagined as a new member state of the German Empire, these hopes were eventually dashed, as the geopolitical realities of post-Weltkrieg Europe and the overwhelming Latvian and Estonian majority population made such a project impossible - not that the Baltic Germans themselves hardly wanted to lose their identity to the Heimat. Having successfully suppressed the Estonian War of Independence and prevented a similar uprising in Latvia thanks to the fractures within the Latvian nationalist movement, the Duchy established itself and now counts almost twenty years of history. \n\nThe United Baltic Duchy is, first and foremost, rooted in tradition. It inherits Provincial Ostsee Law, the system of representation through Landtags, and the institutional role of the Baltic Knighthoods from the times of the Livonian Confederation, and these traditions make up a large part of Baltic German identity. Even the poorest Baltic noble is proud of living in a community which listens to the concerns of each and every landowner, and holds the knightly traditions of the nobility in utmost respect. In practice, however, this means that the Duchy is a barely functional state with a byzantine system of government, completely unprepared for the challenges facing ahead..."

KRBAT.2.t:0 "Convent of von Samson-Himmelstjerna"
KRBAT.2.d:0 "The current Chairman of the Land Colleges, and thus head of the Convent of the Land Administrators, the executive government of the Duchy, is Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna, a former member of the Ducal Regency Council and member of the Baltic German Democratic Party. \n\nFollowing a succession of several conservative governments controlled by the Baltic Knighthoods, the pressure for reform within the United Baltic Duchy eventually became too hard to bear. A strengthening Baltic German middle class, traditionally reluctantly allied with the conservative nobility, started to sway to the other side, joining forces with reformist and Baltic nationalist groups if it meant that any reform to the byzantine, antiquated system is introduced. Though by no means a liberal reformist, eventually Duke Adolf Friedrich himself had to intervene. Using the powers of royal prerogative, he dismissed the previous Chairman of the Land Colleges and cooperated with the liberal reformist Democratic Party to help forge an alliance of liberal and modrate parties. \n\nThe true power behind the throne, however, is Paul Schiemann, the leader of the DbDP. A liberal reformist, he could not assume any position in the Landratskollegium because of his non-noble birth, but nevertheless serves as the guide of the incumbent government from his lowly position. An idealistic visionary, Paul Schiemann envisions a liberal, pluralistic Baltic Federation with an established modern constitution, free, universal and democratic elections, equality between the Baltic Germans and the native Balts, and a system of social welfare. Believing his vision to be superior to the reaction of the Knighthoods, he is supported by the representatives of native Balts and the German middle class in the Landtag, and has the reluctant acquiescence of the moderate conservative DbRP. The Duke also sees his program as a step in the right direction, even if he disagrees with some of the tenets."

KRBAT.3:0 "Government Structure of the Duchy"
KRBAT.3.t:0 "Government Structure of the Duchy"
KRBAT.3.d:0 "The United Baltic Duchy can best be described as a federal oligarchic semi-constitutional monarchy. It is devolved into six Cantons, each one with their own Landtags and Land Colleges, and the autonomous City of Riga. This division of powers is replicated in the federal government, which is composed of the Landtag of the United Baltic Duchy and the Convent of the Land Administrators. The Baltic Landtag is a parliamentary body, elected by the inhabitants of the Duchy with the Prussian three-house electoral system, and is headed by the Land Marshal. The Land Colleges and the Convent are appointed by the four Baltic Knighthoods - corporations of the Baltic German nobility. Above both stands the Duke, who has the power of judicial and executive appointment, and other powers of royal prerogative.\n\nWhile it is easy to assume that the Landtag is the legislature and the Convent is the executive, the truth is far more complicated than that. The Convent is not made up of ministries, but is rather a body of 18 Land Administrators who collectively manage the day to day matters of the state in cooperation with the Knighthoods and the Landtag. They have the features of an upper house - they attend Landtag sessions and cannot propose laws, but review them, and their stated purpose is "vigilant, paternal care for the upholding of the rights, legality, institutions, and fixed customs of the nobility". The Convent does not have permanent ministries, only temporary offices they can form to manage issues once they arise and which fall under their purview. Meanwhile, the Landtag can form its own executive offices and institutions with majority vote, something which the Convent is unable to prevent, nor can they propose laws, so their ability to rule the state is completely at the mercy of the Landtag and whatever it wishes. But the Landtag is at the mercy of the Convent, too, however, as the role of the Baltic Knighthoods to manage the state is institutional and cannot simply be removed.\n\nThis wasn't a problem in the 16th century, when the Knighthoods and Landtag were just a large group of nobles, but things have changed..."

KRBAT.4.t:0 "Political Concerns"
KRBAT.4.d:0 "The coalition orchestrated by the Baltic German Democratic Party may have a noble goal to reform the Duchy to the modern age, but their enemies are plentiful. The Baltic Knighthoods, noble corporations which unite the Baltic German nobility, holds no good will towards the liberal constitutionalist project espoused by Paul Schiemann, seeing it as a threat to the historical traditions of the lands they are supposed to protect. A major thorn in the side of the incumbent Convent is the fact that the Knighthoods have their own man in the government - Baron Rolf von Ungern-Sternberg, Land Marshal of the Ducal Landtag. While by no means a reactionary, von Ungern-Sternberg is a conservative landowner and definitely does not sympathize with the liberal Democratic Party - and should the situation decay, his complacency may break at last.\n\nTwo decades of political decay and infighting have left quite a few Baltic nobles, especially younger ambitious ones, disappointed with the entire system. Both the liberal Baltic Federation project and the reaction of the Baltic Knighthoods disappoint them, the former for surrendering to the inferior natives and the latter for failing to restore the greatness of the Baltic state. Their salvation is the Baltic Brotherhood, a clandestine religious and Pan-Germanic nationalist order, operating in brotherly circles in cities and towns and exerting their power through influence within Baltic German nobles. Its goal is the renewal of the Teutonic spirit of the Baltic Germans and a deep union with the German Empire, and their mission is to resurrect the medieval idea of Drang Nach Osten, a crusade to the East in the name of Germanic supremacy. Due to the Baltic Brotherhood's ambition to centralize the state, both the Duke and Landtag are adamantly incompatible and can never cooperate. \n\nThe Latvians and Estonians have never fully accepted their subordination in the Baltic Duchy. Their nationalist movements lost strength after the failed uprisings of 1918, but rebuilt it by the early 1930s. The government in exile of the Republic of Estonia in Stockholm and the Latvian National Council in Petrograd advocate for the independence of their respective nations, and groups of partisans within the forests and hills are forming in preparation for the final struggle for liberation..."

As the budget for the fiscal year of 1936 has been approved and given the Convent's stamp of approval, the rest of the two-week session has been largely passive and devoid of conflict. The closing statement of the Landtag session has raised a bit of a ruckus, however. Whilst tradition requires the captains of the Four Baltic Knighthoods to make the closing statement and wish the gathered Baltic nobility a good year, Chairman of the Land Colleges Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna instead invited Paul Schiemann, the head of the Democratic Party, to leave the departing Landtag members on a good note. \n\nAlbeit sickly and elderly, Schiemann has managed to fulfill the duties requested, and spoke for half an hour about the envisioned reforms of him, his party, and the government of the Duchy - on the other hand, however, he avoided getting into verbal conflict with the Knighthoods, mentioning them and affirming that 'good men such as these are necessary in times of change, and I sincerely hope that they will lend their support to the cause of reforms'. While this was not going to amend the rift between him and Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau, the Knight-Captain of the Livonian Knighthood and by extension the most powerful of the four Knighthood leaders... the inclusive nature of his speech has dissuaded the fears of many conservatives."

In the first week of debates, no solution has been found, as even the Liberal coalition itself disagrees on what response should be taken. Representatives of the mercantile classes and the moderate conservatives under the Reform Party and Progressive Party, allied with the Democratic Party out of circumstance, vehemently disagree with Paul Schiemann's proposal on a social market economy. He and Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna believe that the Duchy's economic downturn was caused by unbridled free market activity and a compassionate social service system must arise in its place. Moderates such as Edwin Magnus and Werner Hasselblatt have delivered scathing criticism of this proposal in the Landtag, however, despite being ostensibly in the same coalition.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democratic Bloc, a social democratic alliance of Latvian and Estonian representatives in the Landtag, declares that the proposal does not go far enough. Pauls Kalniņš, the leader of the Democratic Bloc faction in the legislature, has delivered a report on the exploitation of native Baltic workers by German business firms in Reval and Riga, descriptions of sharp poverty among the peasant population, and demanded the government to act. All plans for constitutional reforms have to be put to rest when the coalition is struggling to survive."

The Reform Party which von Ungern-Sternberg represents has crossed benches and formed a majority with the DbVP and representatives of the Knighthoods, denying the Liberal coalition legislative power as well.\n\nInstead of resigning and allowing the Four Knighthoods to appoint a new Convent, Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna has chosen to fight.

To this end, several key members of the Party have begun reaching out to the business community within the Duchy, offering them concessions in exchange for support.

The raids of the Forest Brothers have only taken a turn for the more severe, and the frequency at which they assault our outposts, encampments, supply depots, and German-populated villages has only led to their power increasing and more innocent blood being spilt. \n\nIn response to these ever-radicalizing Batltic terrorists, the Batltic Brotherhood has increasingly whispered in the ear of our administration to take far more drastic action against these bandits and murderers. This knightly order calls for swift and total military force to be applied wholesale against the Forest Brothers, burning these rats out from their dens and slaughtering them as they flee. To take such drastic action would surely harshen our image in the face of many, but it would be a sure blow against the rebels. \nAnd are rumors the Baltic Brotherhood are plotting something."

Cooperating with Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau, the Duke has released a decree ordering the incumbent Convent to resign and allow the Four Knighthoods to form a new administration. \n\nFaced with the Duke's insistence, von Samson-Himmelstjerna has finally resigned, and the Baltic Knighthoods have pushed through an aristocratic, conservative government headed by Freiherr Axel von Freytagh-Loringhoven. Finding approval from the conservative People's Party and moderate Reform Party in the Landtag, von Freytagh-Loringhoven has filled out his Land Administrator seats with conservative nobles. In a speech in the Landtag, he has sworn to revert the destructive liberal reforms of the Democratic Party and strengthen the Duchy by maintaining the current course. \n\nPaul Schiemann spoke in the Landtag last, where he stated that he accepts the change in government despite being utterly dismayed at the Duke's betrayal - and asserts that the flame of liberalism will eventually rise again, under a new generation."

The Landtag assembled today to vote on no confidence in the incumbent Land Marshal, a vote which has narrowly passed, to the dismay of the conservatives and the reactionaries. However, lacking sufficient support in the parliament, and finding no help in the politically neutral Duke, they could only complain and mutter between themselves. \n\nIn his departing speech, Land Marshal von Ungern-Sternberg asserted that this political purge will not take off the restraits from Schiemann and his party - the Four Knighthoods, the Courts and the Duke will have to carry the torch of moderation and tradition from here on out.

I've already gotten away with a lot, and what says I can't continue?"\n\n"Graf Goltz will stop you, eventually. He is a loyal monarchist, not... whatever your people are. He will witness the horrors you pursue and put you down."\n\n"Goltz is a senile buffoon. Stuck in a world which has already passed away, pursuing glory which modernity will never provide. He is a fine commander and an excellent figurehead, but a cunning leader he is not. He needs glorious parades, a patriotic vocabulary, and a few assurances, and he will watch the National Revival content."\n\nKursell arose from his seat, allowing the former Duke to retreat to his thoughts. "You're not here because I, or the Inner Circle, hate you - but only because you are not like Graf Goltz."."

The Protocol of 1919 is an anti-semitic text supposedly found in the pocket of a dead Bolshevik soldier during the Russian Civil War. It is a barely coherent fabricated 'report' which gloats over reducing the Russian people to slaves, declares that the revolutions in Russia and France were instigated by a so-called 'International Israelite League', and that it should be used to buy up gold and government bonds across the world in order to build power and influence. Published during the Estonian War of Independence, it has since been picked up by anti-semites and even added as an addendum to later releases of the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion'.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood has released a statement endorsing this decision by the Riga am Sonntag, however, using this as a chance to denounce so-called 'international Jewish conspiracies' and approve the publication of more anti-Semitic material in the following months."

The entire nation is in mourning - the elderly and noble general, having seized control of the nation with the help of the Baltische Landeswehr and the Baltic Brotherhood, saved it from the clutches of collapse and has helped lead it to a new era. For these achievements, he has even receives the honorary title Führer, 'Leader', in reference to his persona, much like many other right wing nationalist regimes which the Baltic State has emulated.\n\nThough he was a famed leader in trying times, von der Goltz did not consolidate power around a loyal clique nor did he manage to win the political battles taking place in the shadows of the government. During his reign, the power of the Baltic Brotherhood continued to rise without anything to halt them, and now that Goltz has passed, the only remaining roadblock to their absolute rule has vanished as well. The Landeswehr is ideologically charged and loyal, Baltic society transformed according to their ideals, and its politics orchestrated according to their whim. It is no surprise that Otto von Kursell and the Brotherhood have seized the apparatus of the state in the aftermath."

While many of the Baltic Germans make their way to Riga, other have chosen to head straight to Germany. Many of them are fearing for their lives and have little belongings with them, and these refugees have flooded our ports in the Baltic Sea. \n\nAmong them are numerous soldiers and officers of the Baltische Landeswehr, including several generals, who now offer their services to the Imperial German Army. There is no doubting their loyalty to the German Empire nor their skill in military matters - the Landeswehr was known as one of the most elite forces in the Reichspakt for a good reason."

Their goals rest on several pillars, all leading towards the same purpose - the complete subjugation of the Baltic German nation to a greater, revelationary ideal, and the complete mobilization of the economy in the name of a grand crusade towards the East. Throughout the following years, all vestiges of capitalism - which the Brotherhood does not hide their hate towards, calling it 'Anglo-Saxonic soul theft' - will have to be destroyed and a hierarchic, orderly, state-controlled system built in its place. The average citizens will have to be groomed and reshaped to become model Christians, they once again need to be imbued with the Teutonic spirit which coarses through their veins.\n\nThe Baltische Landeswehr, which helped the Brotherhood come into power, has no issue with these transformative reforms - after all, their interests will be satiated, and quite a few of them actually sympathize with this extreme, nigh-esoteric nationalism... Many will die in this corpse-strewn way towards National Revival. Many others will suffer. But that is a sacrifice which Otto von Kursell was willing to make."

KRBAT.42.d:0 "A debate has broken out in the halls of the Landtag - the elderly leader of the Democratic Party has been challenged by Woldemar Pussull, leading member of the right-wing Volkspartei. Pussull ascribes himself to the ideological thought of Baron Wilhelm von Fircks, a famous titan of Baltic German politics who was Schiemann's main adversary until his passing in 1933. The debate soon turned towards the fundamentals of Baltic German politics and the ideological goals of both parties.\n\nBoth Pussull and Schiemann agree that the Baltic Germans are a positive presence in the Baltic States and are more worthy of ruling it than the Latvians and Estonians. However, Pussull claims that this is proof of their special position in society, one which should be inherent and should remain in the future. Schiemann disagrees, however, stating that while the Baltic Germans inherit the liberal foundations of Germanic culture, there is nothing which prevents Latvians and Estonians from becoming similarly enlightened through education, merit, and the absorption of Baltic German culture. To him, Baltic Germans carry a burden of passing their civilization on to the Latvian and Estonian peoples. Pussull calls Schiemann out as a hypocrite, however - if the way for Latvians and Estonians to become civilized is through becoming closer to Baltic Germans, then does that not make pure Baltic Germans special?\n\nIt falls to the Landtag members watching the debate to draw their conclusions - and the majority decide that..."

KRBAT.44.d:0 "The Baltic Brotherhood had been shaken by inter-brother ideological struggles for the longest part of 1935, but with the onset of a new year, this conflict has seemingly come to an end. Information about the true inner workings of this secretive, Christian fundamentalist and pan-German nationalist order are few and far between, but throughout the year, the so-called 'outer ring' of the Brotherhood, which maintains some contact with the outside world, has seen many members relieved for "having violated the principles of the Brotherhood". Similar lay-offs have taken place in the even more secretive 'inner ring'. \n\nBrothers previously believed to be calling the shots in the direction of the Brotherhood, such as Harald von Rautenfeld and Eduard von Dellingshausen, have completely lost their influence in its ideology and actions. In their expense, Otto von Kursell has consolidated his absolute rule over the Brotherhood. Having held the position of Leading Brother (Führender Bruder) since 1928, von Kursell was initially seen as a compromise figurehead and a competent administrator who drafted the statute of the Brotherhood, but has shown to be increasingly controlling and ideological over the years. \n\nWithin the Brotherhood, he stands as the leading advocate of the Ostenbewegung faction, a faction of pan-Germanic and Christian fundamentalist bent. It sees itself and all Baltic Germans as the messianic spiritual guide of the Germanic peoples who will lead a militant missionary mission to the Orient, as loyal subservients of a new Germany."

KRBAT.45.t:0 "The Baltic Brotherhood"
KRBAT.45.d:0 "The harsh years of the post-Weltkrieg period left many youthful Baltic German nobles disillusioned. The United Baltic Duchy turned out to be a smouldering dumpster fire, its antiquated traditions completely unfit for the modern day and the particularism of their leaders turning pan-German unity into a distant dream. The world itself began to turn upside down - Bolshevism, Syndicalism and Latvian/Estonian nationalism all rose to shake their old way of life. Faced with all of this, many of them turned towards the Lutheran faith, their religious beliefs, joined by an unyielding anti-syndicalism and pan-Germanic nationalism, developed towards extremism. The Baltic Brotherhood was founded in 1928, by some of the most prominent members of the younger Baltic German generation, including Harald von Rautenfeld, Sylvester von Ropp, Georg and Hans von Manteuffel-Szoeges, and Otto von Kursell.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood was founded as a secret Christian fundamentalist and pan-German order, and remains such to this day. It is organized in Brotherly Rings, which operate in every major town of the Duchy and exist as a place for religious worship, common labor, and philosophical thought. The Brotherhood operates with a defined statute and a set of mandatory principles, including flawless trustworthiness, obedience to one's elder Brother, and chastity, among others. All members of the Brotherhood are divided into the Outer Ring, or Ring of Preparation and the Inner Ring. Advancing from the former to the latter is a considerable feat. \n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood is absolutely not a mass movement, but it maintains a great amount of influence within the government. Many of its members are high ranking members of the Knighthoods and representatives in the Landtag, of course, keeping their allegiance a secret. Among the Baltische Landeswehr, the Brotherhood's most ardent supporter is Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, a member of its Inner Ring."

KRBAT.46.t:0 "Paul Schiemann"
KRBAT.46.d:0 "Carl Christian Theodor Paul Schiemann was born in 1876 in Mitau in Courland, then part of the Russian Empire. While not a noble himself, he came from a wealthy middle class Baltic German family, and was thus able to obtain a fulfilling education in Germany as well as officer military service in the Imperial Russian Army. Even before the Weltkrieg, he gained the notoriety of a bleeding-heart liberal, engaged in constant polemics with conservative Baltic German society, even ending up briefly expelled from Riga by the Livonian Knighthood in 1917. Upon returning to his homeland a year later, he founded the DbDP alongside Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna to push for his vision of a liberal Baltic Federation. \n\nSchiemann is a committed liberal democrat, opposed to conservative nationalism and Syndicalism - the former for standing against everything liberalism fights for, and the latter for being an abnormal deformity of liberty, which denies individual personality in favor of uncultured mediocrity of the masses. His definition of liberalism is different from the West, however. Schiemann believes in abolition of privileges and the strength of individual merit, but not in universal political equality - to him, it is ridiculous to imagine a cleaning maid with the same political rights as a university professor. His political vision is corporatist and more akin to meritocracy than democracy - although, as he concludes, liberal democracy is a good method of finding 'the best men'. To him, it is the cultural mission of the Baltic Germans to teach these liberal ideas to the Latvian and Estonian masses.\n\nSchiemann's other major contribution is the concept of an anational state. Borrowing heavily from Austromarxism, Schiemann interprets ethnicity as a 'spiritual community', much like religion, and posits that nationalism must be separated from the state in the same way religion is - instead, all ethnic groups within a country must exist as voluntary communities defending the interests of their members. This anational statehood forms the basis of his Baltic Federation project."

KRBAT.47.d:0 "Two members of some of the most powerful families of the Baltic nobility, holding different positions and telling different backstories, stand united to defeat Schiemann and restore what they believe to be the righteous path of tradition.\n\nBorn in 1880, Baron Rolf Edvard Clemens von Ungern-Sternberg, a native of the city of Reval, hails from a branch of the famous noble house of von Ungern-Sternberg. Educated as a road construction engineer, he became a diplomat for the Imperial Russian diplomatic service, and spent twenty years of his life travelling across the planet as an envoy for two monarchies, first Russian and the Baltic - these travels saw him walk the streets of Constantinople, Paris, Lisbon and even Nagasaki, where he spent almost half a decade of his life. After visiting his distant cousin in Mongolia, a turn of events which the House of Ungern-Sternberg still finds hard to come to terms with, Rolf returned to his homeland, those two decades leaving him a changed man. The Baron has the stature and wit of an erudite, knows several languages and spends his free time writing poetry - but all of his experiences in the world only strengthened his belief that the traditions of the Baltic German peoples are exemplary and must be defended against liberal encroachment. \n\nBorn in 1885, Baron Adolf Constantin Theodor Pilar von Pilchau is the son of Adolf Pilar von Pilchau, the founding father of the Baltic Duchy, its first and longest lasting head of government. It is a fact which von Pilchau always mentions, it is the fact which propelled him to a political career in the Livonian Knighthood, and it is the fact which has built him into an arrogant, self-assured snob. Out of all the leaders of the Four Knighthoods, he is least afraid to use his power, assured that it cannot backfire against him and that the cause he fights for is right. Having supported his father's decision to banish Paul Schiemann in 1917, Pilchau sports a rivalry with him to this day."

KRBAT.48.d:0 "News of the Forest Brothers uprising in Livland caught the Landtag of the United Baltic Duchy completely unprepared, and its lack of action may be considered to be one of the reasons why this uprising broke out in the first place. The divided Landtag is being pressured by outside forces to act - the Landeswehr demands national unity in the face of crisis, and the Duke has stepped out ordering his government to seek a rapprochement with the right-wing opposition.\n\nThe leader of the Livonian Knighthood, Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau, made his move first, reaching out to Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna directly and offering a deal he could not refuse. For the following two months, the Landtag will work together to pass laws necessary to restore order in the Duchy, and in exchange, both sides will forgo building up coalitions and alliances to take the other down for that time. Paul Schiemann demands his peers to seek no compromise, however - according to him, Pilchau and Sternberg will take advantage of the peace to scheme behind their backs and try to take down the government. And perhaps there is a reason to fear this, as Pilchau is definitely not the type of person to put country over party...\n\nOn the other hand, refusing the armistice and continuing the political brawl in the midst of a guerrilla war will not bode well for our nation's stability, nor will forces outside of the Landtag approve.

Unique between all countries in Europe, the Baltic Landeswehr is completely independent from the civilian government aside for a largely powerless Military Commission in the Land Administration - in fact, this arrangement was born out of a necessity, for the military could not afford to wait for orders from an incompetent, ancient government system. In this critical moment, this independence meant that the Landeswehr has turned into an enemy, not an ally, of the administration in Riga.\n\nThis anti-civilian authority fever has reached the supreme commander of the Landeswehr, Rüdiger von der Goltz, as well, and a salvation soon approached him in the form of the Baltic Brotherhood. Otto von Kursell's clandestine religious nationalist order spectated the events in the Landtag from the shadows and came to the same conclusion as the arch-conservative commander - that this decadent and self-destructive conflict needs to go. The Landtag, the Knighthoods, and the Duke who turns a blind eye to the chaos, all need to go - and to this end, von der Goltz and von Kursell have reached a secret agreement which will come into effect in the following days."

One hundred and fifty members of the legislature and all members of the Convent of Land Administrators were left besieged, learning through secret channels that offices of the Four Baltic Knighthoods are being raided, martial law is being enacted across the country, and local civilian authorities are surrendering to military pressure. The whereabouts of Duke Adolf Friedrich are unknown.\n\nA few hours later, General von Manteuffel-Szoege presented his demands to the besieged Landtag - the dissolution of the legislature and the Convent of Land Administrators, to be replaced by a 'faithful and respected government', headed by Rüdiger von der Goltz as emergency Regent and Otto von Kursell as the new Chairman of the Convent. Fearing further repercussions, the majority of the Landtag voted to surrender, despite the resistance by members of the Riga Democratic Bloc, who have since been arrested for disturbing public order."

KRBAT.52.d:0 "Two approaches to the redoubt question have formed within the Baltische Landeswehr. \n\nOne faction believes that the approach to a potential breakthrough in the Ostwall should be simple - the Duna River and the urban landscape of the city of Riga offer a defense which can be made impenetrable with enough fortifications. This would also keep the Baltic holdout in touch with the rest of the front and thus leave them open to reinforcements from the south. \n\nAn another faction has a different view of a possible Russian-Reichspakt War. Because of our fortifications on the eastern border, it is likely that the Russians will avoid a direct assault against them and instead strike southwards, through White Ruthenia and Lithuania, which these officers see as the weakest link. In such a situation, the Duchy will be isolated from the rest of the Reichspakt, and thus should hole up in cities such as Riga and Reval, where they can receive German support through the sea and hold up the Russians while the Empire's forces do battle in the south.\n\nWhich approach has more merit?"

A descendant of a honored Prussian noble family with a history of military officers, von der Goltz had a long and bountiful career in the Imperial German Army even before the Weltkrieg, during which he was a division commander respected on the Western and Eastern Fronts alike. In 1918, he became the General Staff's primary asset in relations with its Eastern regions - early that year, he was sent to Finland as a representative of the German forces and promptly took control of the state as a dictator. When that became untenable, he was reassigned to the Baltic duchy, where he laid down the foundations for the Baltische Landeswehr. The army of the Duchy owes everything to von der Goltz, and he knows that. \n\nAn aristocrat by blood and personality, the Graf has little patience for democracy and the squabbling liberals in the Landtag. While many of his fellow German veterans who helped found the Baltische Landeswehr ultimately returned to Germany, von der Goltz stayed, knowing that not only will the Duchy require his services yet again, but that he will be able to take advantage of the situation and finally rise beyond a mere chief of staff of the Landeswehr.

KRBAT.64.d:0 "The influx of refugees from Latvia and Estonia has put a severe strain upon the municipal government of Riga - and it already wasn't doing well before, what with Black Monday and an unruly Latvian population to deal with. These refugees were Baltic Germans, at least those who could afford to flee - nobles, politicians, administrators, wealthy entrepreneurs, soldiers and officers...\n\nBut a chance to escape to Riga's relative calm did not do much to relieve them. What's the point? It was a sentence which echoed often through the streets and halls of the city. They have lost their only, God-granted chance for a Baltic German state, a country they could call their own - and they lost it because of their own foolishness, infighting and stubbornness. Why couldn't they prevent this loss? Why couldn't they simply work together when the situation called for it?\n\nAnd what happens now?\n\nPerhaps the answer is that they carried the errors of the past with them like weights, and failed to remove them when the time was due. When they should have extended a hand to the Latvians and Estonians, the Baltic Germans left them in the mud, and so suffered the consequences. The Baltic German Democratic Party has always been strong in Riga, and with Paul Schiemann's full retirement, the burden of maintaining his liberal dream falls to the shoulders of Wilhelm Munter.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that they were weak, divided, and failed to unite at a moment when the life of the Duchy was on the line. Concentrated in the Pan-German League, Baltic German nationalists, revanchist nobles, and their allies among the German intervention forces plot to make sure this mistake does not get repeated again. The diplomat Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter has returned from Germany to serve as the movement's leader.\n\nOf course, the incumbent Mayor, Helmuth Stegman, has a vision to call his own - if he can successfully maneuver through the coming months. Whether Riga sees him stay in charge or a new leader assume the role, they will have a difficult task ahead of them - to find a reason for Riga to exist."

The school managers chose to hire a substitute teacher to fill out vacancies in their increasingly aging administration, but soon came to regret their mistake. Said teacher, Alfred Rosenberg, a Baltic German native of Reval, was hired to teach history in this prestigious institution, but as it turned out, his curriculum was an incomprehensible mess about Aryan racial theories, vehement anti-semitism, and rants about ''degenerate'' modern art. \n\nThe most egregious offence, however, was the fact that Herr Rosenberg fabricated proof of his noble status, which is mandatory for all teachers in the school. This was cause for him to be expelled and fined 250 Baltic marks. For Herr Rosenberg, this was an amount of money difficult to pay - a teacher with several years of experience in various gymnasiums, he never really got into a position where he could earn that much money - but he eventually scrounged up the fine, and promptly decided to emigrate to Germany. \n\nThe story has earned a little bit of notoriety in Baltic press, mostly as an interesting example of relations between the Baltic Knighthoods and the Baltic German commoners."

KRBAT.66.d:0 "Immediately after the beginning of Black Monday, the fragile byzantine government of the United Baltic Duchy descended into political infighting and its government froze because of its antiquated system. The situation in the state decayed to a point where a mass underground Latvian and Estonian rebellion broke out to overthrow it. This was not cause for concern at first, as the belief was that professional, veteran forces of the Baltische Landeswehr will be able to suppress resistance. Once this belief turned out to be foolishly optimistic, our forces have chosen to take matters to their own hands. \n\nA detachment of marines supported by the Baltic Sea Fleet and a Heer infantry brigade have landed in Riga, cleared the city of Latvian resistance fighters and secured a perimeter around the city. Expansion further from the Riga base turned out to be impossible without additional reinforcement, as local Baltic forces have essentially disintegrated, thus the German army command in Riga agreed to instead prop up the city municipal government, led by Helmuth Stegman, as a continuation state of the former Duchy. \n\nThis has salvaged our influence in the Baltic region, but also requires us to define our foreign policy regarding the new states of Latvia and Estonia."

KRBAT.67.d:0 "After internal turmoil throughout 1936, our puppet state to the east, the United Baltic Duchy, fell under the control of a military junta controlled by the Baltic Brotherhood, an association of radical Christian and nationalist nobility who sought to transform their state from the ground up. It is openly Pan-Germanic, and whether we approve of their policies or not, they claim that everything they have done is geared towards loyalty to us and our supposed role as the savior of Europe from 'eastern barbarism' - a totalitarian, nationalist, militaristic dictatorship now controls Riga and Reval. \n\nThe ideology of the Brotherhood claims that the true nature of Germany, its national body, cannot manifest itself in the Kaiserreich, shackled by hundreds of old and new divisions alike, therefore the Baltic must set the example for Germany's national rebirth and sacrifice itself, its name and identity, in the name of a new Germany. In practice, it means that the Baltics are trying to appeal to our radical and nationalist political groups by setting themselves as a success story of national populism in Germany - and this example has allowed them to grow."

The rank and file members of the Democratic Party are calling us to not forget the average person and dial down the hostile political battle in the Landtag somewhat to prevent this crisis from breaking the nation apart.

Their exiles escaped to the West, where socialist leaning Latvian communities had already been firmly established and accepted them with open arms.

During the intervening years, he assembled the Revolutionary Latvian Legion, a small regiment of trained Latvian exiles, ready to return home to instigate a revolution. Now, when the United Baltic Duchy is collapsing, he has found his chance.\n\nWith a brief, yet heartfelt goodbye, Peterss has offered his goodbye to his English wife, his friends, and made a last speech before the Trade Union Congress, where he assured the Union and the rest of the Third Internationale that he shall return a leader of the Second Iskolat Republic."

Nowhere else is this more exemplified than in the poem 'Die Baltenfahne' ('The Baltic Banner').\n\nWritten by Baron Manteuffel-Katzdangen, a Baltic German nobleman who fled to Riga with his family and belongings, it tells the story of the Baltic German retreat to the city, symbolizing it with the theme of the 'Baltic Banner' - a representation of the role of the Baltic Germans as the defenders of Germany in the East, as their outpost which has since been forced out of their birthright. And yet, the poem is optimistic - it calls for those who remain to pick up the banner and return to the Ostland, where it belongs.\n\nThe poem has since been turned into a song - 'Die Grenzwacht hielt im Osten' ('the Border Guard of the East'), adopted by Riga's Baltic German community as a rallying march for their future return."

Shockingly, the Duke managed to win the race he choose to give patronage to as well.

The plot of the novel revolves around the murder of the monk Fra Augustino in the garden of the aforementioned Great Tyrant, the absolute ruler of the city state who is a constant presence in the book, yet never mentioned by name. The rest of the novel is dedicated to a series of characters, all of whom try to solve the crime, fail, and attempt to please the Great Tyrant by accusing innocents of having committed the crime - all of these lies are seen through, however, and the roster of character thins with each chapter. A court session is held at the end of the book, whereupon it is revealed that the Tyrant himself had ordered the monk murdered - he orders all the documents of the case to be burned and pleas for forgiveness.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood hails the novel as a great example of the sort of culture they wish to foster - noting the religious themes of the book and the larger-than-life standing of the Great Tyrant, including his turn to good and towards the Christian faith. Hushed whispers in the ground speak of the true themes of the book - the madness of autocracy and unquenched bloodthirst of a single absolute ruler, and how the allegories in the novel represent the totalitarian regime of the Baltic state."

New Evangelics, written by von der Ropp, have been distributed across the country, heavily rewritten to reject almost the entirety of the Old Testament and its emphasis on the passive, rather than active, aspects of Jesus Christ - miraculous birth, suffering, betrayal by the Pharisees and otherworldly redemption. Instead, it stresses Jesus's actions as a preacher and fighter who sought to destroy institutional Judaism and bring forth salvation.\n\nThough officially the entirety of the nation has converted to the Brotherhood's interpretation of Christianity, the absolute majority of the population do not follow the guidelines set forth, and reject them either openly or secretly.

During these three months, he has crossed hundreds of miles and even gotten into a couple of accidents on the edge of life or death - but, in the end, he states that feeling the thrill and quenching the thirst of curiosity was worth it.\n\nThe Duke has already begun plotting his next journey - and states that he will follow through with it as long as no war gets in the way."

KRBAT.89.t:0 "The Freikorps"
KRBAT.89.d:0 "The news of the Forest Brothers rebellion have reached Germany, and thousands of Germans have taken this as a chance to rise up. Nationalist minded Weltkrieg veterans have begun to organize into armed paramilitary volunteer groups and make their way to the United Baltic Duchy - these battalions call themselves the Freikorps. The leaders of these units are colorful in their backgrounds and so are their followers, but many of them are veterans who never managed to fully integrate back into society after the Weltkrieg, ended up swept up by nationalist associations, and romanticize their time in the front.\n\nGeneral Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, one of the commanders responsible for the suppression of the Forest Brothers, has been approached by the leader of one of the smaller Freikorps - a former officer in the Bavarian Army and a not so successful agronomist, Heinrich Himmler. Speaking for the volunteers, Himmler offered their support in suppressing the Latvians and Estonians. Though Manteuffel could barely stand the officer's erratic way of speaking and the way how he appealed to some weird sense of "Aryan brotherhood" in almost every sentence, an offer of support is still an offer of support - and so his report arrived to the Landeswehr headquarters in Riga about new groups of volunteers wishing to help. What should be the response?"

KRBAT.90.t:0 "Into the Fire"
KRBAT.90.d:0 "Deployed to the Baltic countryside, the Freikorps volunteers have spent their time leisurely patrolling the countryside and extorting the local villages, often with unnecessary brutality, drawing the ire of the local population while achieving very little in actually suppressing the partisans. Heinrich Himmler's unit in particular spent more time listening to the Bavarian officer's stories of how he was going to expel the Latvians from their land and build himself a chicken farm on this Eastern soil than actually going after Latvian resistance.\n\nThe response of the Forest Brothers was swift. Attacking from bases in the dense Livland forests, they would always catch the German volunteers unprepared and descend back into shadows immediately after their strike. More often than not, the Baltische Landeswehr would only be made aware of the battles after their far more prepared battalions came across the remains, and thus try to deduce what happened from the dead. As the Landeswehr reported, a complete lack of discipline, prevalent intoxication, and a lack of any measures against traps were the most common causes of these losses.\n\nIn Livland, Baltic German soldiers recovered a few officers who made it out past the fighting. One of them was Heinrich Himmler, who managed to escape the wrath of the partisans by fleeing into a thick forest. Like many of his peers, he arrived to the Baltics expecting a cakewalk against "subhumans", and yet found only death."

KRBAT.93.d:0 "When the news reached camp, the Duke of the United Baltic Duchy and his small party of explorers were established deep in the jungles of German Congo. Far from civilization, distanced from the nearest port by hundreds of kilometers of jungle and savanna, Adolf Friedrich was informed by a panicking messenger that his return will be far, far more difficult than anticipated. The continent has collapsed to war and bloodshed - the incompetent colonial government in Dar es Salaam has run Mittelafrika down to a point where all vestiges of the Statthalter's authority have vanished. Warlords and cliques, each one supported by armed bands of Askari, now roam across the vast continent, carving it up into fiefdoms and going to war against one another. And they are now trapped in this maelstrom.\n\nThe Duke's party is composed of two fellow explorers, three devoutedly loyal Landeswehr officers, and a handful of Askari - a paulry force which will now have to escort a high profile passenger across hundreds of miles of battleground. This got the Duke to ready his rifle with more vigor than usual - it is time for the biggest, and hopefully not the last, adventure of his life.\n\nMeanwhile, the news of the collapse of Mittelafrika has sent the government of the United Baltic Duchy to a panic. Already, [BAT.GetHeadOfGovernment] is being advised to appoint a permanent regency, and perhaps, if the Duke does not show up anytime soon, to declare him officially dead and enthrone his successor. Duke Adolf Friedrich's daughter, Princess Woizlawa Feodora, expects him to return, however. According to her, this is nothing her veteran father cannot handle."

KRBAT.94.d:0 "The day after the news arrived, Duke Adolf Friedrich and his camp gathered in the monarch explorer's tent to figure out their next course of action. Any planning they could do, however, was extremely limited - their knowledge about the post-collapse makeup of Mittelafrika was nonexistent, they had no clue who was in charge in the nearest village, much less in the towns and cities of the gigantic colony. All that could be done is educated guesses and hopes that the warlords carving up Mittelafrika are not as bloodthirsty as they could be.\n\nFollowing the Duke's advice, and with the support of the Askari who knew the land, the expedition decided to continue with their planned course. From their current location, they should head to Boyoma, formerly known as Stanleyville - the Congo River is the best natural highway for them to escape through, and before the expedition began, the Duke had contracted a Belgian shipping company in the city to lend them a boat with which they would be able to make their way to Kinshasa.\n\nThe other day after setting off from camp, the Duke learned from group of African patrols that Boyoma, as well as the entire eastern half of Congo, are under the control of Louis de Gonzague-Bobozo, an Askari officer who runs the Kivu Clique. Perhaps he is amiable enough to help."

Askari and conscripted locals are everywhere, taking young men pretty much from the streets in order to drag them into service, while the rest of the population are being levied tax after tax to fund these military ventures. At least, that is what a scout sent by the Duke informed about while the rest of the party took refuge in an abandoned farm at the outskirts of the city.\n\nEntering Boyoma like nothing's going on is not an option. While the Duke's Belgian contractor is still there, if a party of Askari and Baltic Germans are noticed in the streets, they will immediately be treated as hostiles - and if the warlord's men realize how important of a person their leader is, he will almost certainly be kidnapped for ransom. With this intelligence now in their grasp, the Duke and his men gather outside the hut that's been their shelter, discussing their possible plan ahead."

KRBAT.96.d:0 "Activity in Boyoma does not die down at night completely, but the amount of soldiers on the streets is less to the point where making one's way through the town is actually viable. Hoping to not catch anyone's attention, the Duke and his party hid their weapons and made their way through the streets quickly, not speaking a single word to one another until they finally reached the Belgian shipping entrepreneur's house - a man whom Adolf Friedrich had the pleasure of working with in past expeditions already, and who kept his head low as soon as the Mittelafrikan system collapsed.\n\nAs soon as the Belgian led his friend and party to the town docks, however, shouting broke out, rifles were cocked and soldiers went into position. Turns out the men of the Kivu Clique were getting ready to requisition the ship already, and so the steamboat was now crawling with the warlord's soldiers. The orders of Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, came immediately - storm the ship, draw your weapons, and take out the enemy with as little sound as possible.\n\nEven if they only numbered a handful, that was more than enough to sweep the ship - professional and disciplined career soldiers stand head and shoulders above barely trained conscripts. The final kill came from the Duke's handgun, hitting the last African soldier in the neck and throwing the body overboard. As soon as the ship was cleared, the engine was fired up and the vessel took off from port. By the time the morning arrives, the Kivu will be furious, but their target will have long since vanished."

KRBAT.97.d:0 "One of the Duke's Askari, dressed in a farmer's rags and keeping his distance from everyone in the city, made his way to the Boyoma docks, finding the man Adolf Friedrich instructed to find and explaining the situation. As it turns out, the two of them were old friends and cooperated in exploration missions before, so the old businessman, who had kept his head low as soon as the Mittelafrikan system collapsed, agreed to risk his career and help. The rest of the party made camp downstream from the city, and waited for a ship to pass by.\n\nNone seemed to come even as hours passed and the day was replaced by night. Meanwhile, the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, informed that their position was already compromised - as it turns out, they have been noticed by a patrol of the clique's soldier not too long ago and forces in the city were already mobilizing to engage them. The soldiers were ordered to take arms, pack all of their belongings and be ready for a skirmish while escaping the enemy forces - and then, the sound of a whistle reached them. A ship was approaching, the same one which the Duke had handpicked for his expedition months ago, and it was finally coming to he rescue.\n\nTurns out the businessman was held up by some soldiers trying to requisition the ship, but handily resolved the matter and was ready to lend it back to the Germans. The party quickly boarded the ship and departed - the Kivu will certainly be furious, but their target will have long since vanished."

KRBAT.98.d:0 "Getting around the city, the Duke and his party travelled downsream the Congo River, watching out for any vessels they might possibly be able to board. And, sure enough, they eventually found their target. In the depths of the Congo, the river is one of the few means of transportation available, and the Kivu clique put it to use - a ferry bringing several dozen conscripts from the northern villages passed by, making its way towards the capital of the clique. The number of men they'd have to deal with was intimidating at first, but the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, bet on his chances.\n\nThe Lieutenant made the first shot, firing from the bushes and sniping the captain away, which immediately sent the ship into chaos. The few soldiers commanding the ship were not trained enough to deal with attacks from land while they're on the ship, so they made the fatal mistake of steering it closer to the coast in order to fire upon the attackers - which meant that, using makeshift rafts, the soldiers were able to board the ship and fight through the crew. Pretty much all of the fresh conscripts either surrendered or dove to the river immediately, while those fighting were easily eliminated by the Baltic German professionals. The final kill came from the Duke's handgun, hitting the last African soldier in the neck and throwing the body overboard.\n\nBy the time the morning arrives, the Kivu will be furious, but their target will have long since vanished."

KRBAT.101.d:0 "Formerly known as Coquilhatville, Mbandaka is a halfway point from Boyoma to the Atlantic Ocean - and it is the capital of the Tshuapa clique, led by Justin Kokolo, a yet another Askari commander turned warlord. That is the information which Duke Adolf Friedrich and his party received as their vessel approached the city over the Congo river, which has once again forced them to start planning. In the living quarters of the ship, a map has been stretched, notebooks laid down where all the scraps of information about the Mittelafrika's collapse are marked, and their next move is being deliberated.\n\nMuch like in Boyoma, simply entering the city is out of question - the ship will be searched and taken hostage faster than they can say "how much is the ransom?". If they are careless, that is. Perhaps, if they hide everything unusual about the ship - the German passengers, the weapons and the uniforms - they can pass by as an inconspicuous local ship and get away with only a few questions. Alternatively, there is the option to not deal with the risk at all, bring the ship to land and try to carry it over several miles of jungle before plopping it down back in the Congo."

KRBAT.102.t:0 "The Long March"
KRBAT.102.d:0 "Lacking other options on how to keep a low profile, the Duke's party scuttled the ship and began dragging it over land, carrying it through jungle routes on the backs of the men - its largely wooden construction meant that it was light enough to carry by the party. Slowly, they made their way through the jungle, following maps of the region to avoid the city as well as any major roads, and so sneak under the nose of the Tshuapa clique. At night and during rain, the ship would serve as their shelter, and whenever the road becomes clear again, they'd move out and continue.\n\nIt was not as simple as initially anticipated, however. During the long march, the party had to escape and fend off several bands of brigands who would spot them and immediately get ready to engage. Whether they were associated with the warlord and his forces, the Germans and Askari had no chance to figure out, as they simply could not afford to stop and ask questions. All of them would soon regret their choice, anyway - as soon as they'd approach the party to extort tribute, they would see the supposedly helpless travellers reveal their hidden weapons and turn their ship into cover - the Landeswehr has faced off against this routine enough times during the Forest Brothers rebellion. Usually, just showing their teeth would be enough to get the brigands to flee.\n\nAfter reaching a safe enough spot downstream from Mbandaka, the party once again pushed the boat into the river and boarded it, setting off to the next stop in their journey."

KRBAT.103.t:0 "A Near Discovery"
KRBAT.103.d:0 "In a few hours, the vessel was swiftly transformed into an inconspicuous civilian boat - a few Askari remained on the deck, all out of uniform and wearing casual rags, while the rest of the party, all of their belongings, and weapons were carried deep into the ship's compartments. Just as expected, as soon as the vessel crossed into the boundaries of the town, shouting from the coast ordered it to stop by the nearest pier. One of the Askari was instructed to explain their situation and craft a story about just being a group of farmers passing by on their boat, and a conversation in French ensued.\n\nThough the Askari insisted to just go without much questioning or searching, and managed to convince the clique's men that there is nothing of value to be found in his ship, a younger conscript among their ranks snuck in to the compartments under the deck on his own, without anyone's knowledge. As soon as he discovered the hiding European adventurers, Lieutenant von Freytagh-Loringhoven caught him and slit his throat before he could release a single yelp. Realizing what was about to happen, the Askari immediately insisted to just pay the rest a bribe to let them go - which the soldiers were content with, and by the time they realized that one of their own was missing, the boat had already left the city.\n\nAs soon as the unfortunate victim's body got thrown overboard, the Duke and his men set off to the next stop in their journey."

After all, not only were they so close to the Atlantic, and so their freedom, but they were also entering the lands of King Pedro VII, the ruler of the formerly autonomous Kingdom of Kongo - and so a step up from the usual Askari warlord. Little did they know that there was not much better to write about this supposed "Kingdom", which, like all other states in the former Mittelafrika, were led by a warlord clique.\n\nAnd they were aware that the Duke was coming.\n\nAn ambush suddenly began, hooks were thrown from the foliage of the jungle to slow down the ship and force it to stop, while boats took off from Kinshasa to meet the incoming vessel. The surroundings were crawling with Kongo clique soldiers, there was no chance of fighting back - therefore, the Duke ordered his men to stand down, lay down their guns and surrender.\n\nThe first ship which arrived to the scene took in the Duke immediately - as it turns out, they were aware from the beginning that an European royal was coming their way, and so prepared for this seizure in advance. Even in the depths of Africa, rumors spread very quickly."

KRBAT.105.d:0 "For the past week, Duke Adolf Friedrich has been held in a makeshift prison cell in Kinshasa, always watched over by a rotating guard of Askari soldiers loyal to the Kongo clique. The fact that the monarch was past sixty years old slipped by the minds of the African soldiers after they dumped him in the unsanitary cell, given scrap to eat once per day, while they were figuring out how to get the telephone line in Kinshasa working again so they can send a message to Europe and inform that they seek a ransom. Hey, at least that means if he survives for long enough, he might eventually get home...\n\nBut when day once again changed to night, the cell's Askari guard spoke over the door - and the language was Ewe, native to Togoland, which the Duke had taken his time to learn when he served as the colony's governor.\n\nThe Askari introduced himself as Martin Aku - a Togolese native born in the colony during the Duke's time as governor, who travelled to Germany after the war, studied medicine, and finally travelled to Mittelafrika before being forcefully recruited into the Kongolese clique's army as a field medic. Much like the Duke, he wants to return to Europe, and so he offered to break the monarch out of imprisonment and pick him up with them.\n\nThem. He's not alone, he has convinced several more Askari to defect and join his escape tonight."

When the clock struck midnight, Aku unlocked the cell and escorted Duke Adolf Friedrich into the streets, where he was joined with several of his conspirators - they have already drank the "loyalist" prison guards to sleep throughout the course of the evening, and while it's left them a little tipsy, they were ready to grab a boat and escape to the Atlantic. Kinshasa is a pretty big city, unfortunately, and the defectors were soon compromised by a dog barking next to a sleeping patrol - alerting them, causing panic, misunderstanding and finally a shootout.\n\nNot wishing to engage the warlord's soldiers and so lose the only chance they had to escape with their lives, Adolf Friedrich, Aku and the rest fled, not even bothering to fire back. At this point, however, the Kinshasa docks were already full of soldiers, all woken up and alerted by the ongoing fighting, and by the time the party stumbled into the series of customs houses, warehouses and docked ships which composed the port, there was no way out left.\n\nAt this critical moment, however, a door behind them cracked open, revealing a familiar, if battered face - with a partially ripped uniform and a rifle in his hand, Lieutenant von Freytagh-Loringhoven stood and waited for his Duke to follow.\n\n"Come with me if you want to live.""

Fighting through their detainers, only the Lieutenant managed to escape, while the rest had to be left behind and almost certainly died - hunted for the entire week, he survived off whatever he could scavenge in the city while searching for a way to escape. And now, with the Duke in tow, von Freytagh-Loringhoven could finally put his plan into action.\n\nSneaking through the docks, the party suddenly assaulted a docked patrol boat, taking out and throwing out the sailors manning it, and immediately revved the engines. The rest of the mobilized forces quickly caught what was going on, and under the Lieutenant's orders, the entire party fled from the deck, cramping into a small comparment below to avoid gunfire coming off the coast. Three boats took off after theirs, but could no longer catch the escaping party - and, in case any one of them got too close, von Freytagh-Loringhoven always had his rifle ready. He never needed it, however, and the survivors could take a breath of relief. The worst was over."

He moved to Germany instead, where he worked as a coal miner in the Rhineland, got to learn about the plight of the lower classes his family used to dismiss, and became a Syndicalist. Since then, he's moved to the Künstlerkolonie Berlin, publishing avant-garde literature, translating the works of his grand-uncle Pyotr Kropotkin, and writing treatises about the situation back in his homeland.\n\nIn response to the political instability in the United Baltic Duchy, the "Red Graf" has published a short essay about his view on the Baltic German state and its future, under the pseudonym "Peter Lorenz". There, he writes that the Baltic-German Democratic Party and its reforms are but an attempt by the bourgeoisie classes of the Duchy to prevent a revolution of the proletariat with soulless appeasement. The social tensions, the byzantine government structure, and the oppression of the Latvians and Estonians create a perfect set of conditions for a revolutionary liberation of the Baltic states - and he will be eager to support it if that happens."

Throughout the past few months, he and his fellow German socialists have organized an underground network to ship liberal politicians, Latvian and Estonian partisans, and Jews out of the Baltics and into Germany, where they can be safe from persecution. This has granted the Red Graf a folk hero status in the country and allows those who escaped to organize into resistance organizations outside of the reach of the Landeswehr."

The situation is growing worse with every report and requires immediate attention.\n\nThough shipments from Germany should alleviate the hunger eventually, relying upon them does not sit right with von Kursell and his government - if the Baltics are to become a model province for the National Revival, they cannot rely upon anyone. The Inner Circle of the Brotherhood has been gathered to deliberate upon the situation - a solution was found immediately. To ensure that everyone in the society gets their fair share, the government must take full control of the food supply in the Baltic state, to take from the people their agricultural surplus by force and distribute it to those who need it. \n\nThe issue comes on the means how this ideal will be implemented. The youthful recruits in the Initiation Circle cry that fault falls upon unequal distribution of wealth - the fat capitalist cats in the cities and the decrepit old landowners in the countryside need to have their estates seized, their wealth taken by force, and distributed to those suffering. The Inner Circle takes a more pragmatic view to the issue, however. To von Kursell, Manteuffel-Szoege and others, the Baltic Germans must take priority, and Latvians and Estonians, being the subservient, need to pay the price for German revival. Their program would call for the forceful seizure of agricultural surplus in the countryside to distribute it to the cities and provinces with Baltic German population.\n\nWhatever policy they may choose, the Landeswehr stands ready to implement it on the ground."

KRBAT.114.d:0 "Owing to their Baltic origin, and influence by the agrarian Blut und Boden movement in Germany, the Baltic Brotherhood places great importance upon the issue of agriculture - and with their takeover of the country, they are able to implement their designs upon the Baltic countryside. The brothers of the Inner Circle stand by a romanticized, aristocratic view of the land - a system of natural hierarchy, where the blue-blooded Baltic German class reigns and the lesser non-German classes serve. However, the aristocrat of the nationally revived Baltic State should have little in common with what the Brotherhood perceives to be "decrepit, corrupt, sycophantic landowners" of the decades before, who merely hoard the wealth of the land and waste it on luxury. As the propaganda machine claims, the Baltic German aristocrat earns his right to reign over his servants by being modest, prudent, devoutly Christian, and above all else, a noble "Wehrbauer" - an idealized image of a medieval German colonist in the East, able both to work the land and to defend it, not unlike the Ordensburgs of the Teutonic Order. A knight, defending his land and the peasantry which serves it, connected to the soil and the Nation he is a part of, for he has to protect it with his own arms - this is the ideal proclaimed by the Brotherhood.\n\nWith this goal in mind, the regime has embarked on a quest to dismantle and destroy the Landsgemeinde, replacing them with new estates drawn and land redistributed in favor of the Baltic Germans. These rural communes, democratic Latvian and Estonian peasant communities, would often resist the transformation by force, requiring Landeswehr intervention and often brutal measures to prevent the spread of unrest. Though Otto von Kursell and his government assumed that Baltic Germans would flock from the cities to help build this propagandized rural life, few were interest in the prospect - thus hundreds of them had to be moved into the countryside by force."

KRBAT.115.t:0 "Fate of the Dvinsk Autonomous Region"
KRBAT.115.d:0 "After regaining control of the Dvinsk region, known locally as Latgale, the Kerensky government established the Dvinsk Autonomous Region to appease the local Latvian and Latgalian inhabitants. This autonomous region took the form of a local directly elected congress, staffed by Latvian and Latgalian politicians, who were granted large discretion in dealing with local affairs. Throughout the post-war period, this has turned Latgale into a haven for Latvian culture, it is where their partisans in the United Baltic Duchy organize secret supply chains and recruit volunteers as well.\n\nNow that our government has taken control of the country, and seeks to centralize the state in Moscow, an opportunity arises to dismantle this Latvian autonomy and put the Dvinsk region under direct rule. On the other hand, perhaps we can swallow our pride and leave the Latvians be? After all, right now they are pretty complacent..."

KRBAT.116.t:0 "The Fall of Germany"
KRBAT.116.d:0 "Ominous news have arrived to Riga - the German titan has fallen. Overwhelmed by enemy onslaught, its armies have finally surrendered, the Kaiser and his government have escaped overseas, and its lands have been occupied. An era in world history comes to an end, and nowhere else is this impact felt more deeply than in the Baltic states, which had relied upon its brothers in the Reich for so long.\n\nNow, with the Reichswehr fallen, the Baltic Germans are alone in the world, besieged by all sides, and only a miracle can possibly save them from destruction. Will the Kaiser and the survivors return to save them, will an unexpected third force enter the war and swing the tide in their favor? Even the most optimistic in the government and in the Baltische Landeswehr cannot shake off the fear of the future. Soldiers march to their posts with grim determination and public officials respond to questions with an ever so slight tinge of dread.\n\nAnd yet, while many at least considered the possibility of defection or surrender, just as many remain stalwart in their posts. After all, there is no point in being afraid of the inevitable."

KRBAT.117.t:0 "Schiemann's Speech"
KRBAT.117.d:0 "Throughout the past few years, the Baltic German Democratic Party has assumed a dominant role in the country. Because of this, the party as ballooned in numbers - and while these new recruits are welcome, they also dilute Paul Schiemann's message. Many of them believe in Western style liberal democracy, whose equalized representation of every person stands against his ideal of meritocratic statehood. Now that the Constitutional Convention has begun, he has risen to the podium of the Party headquarters to make a speech and set the party on the right track.\n\nThere, he has spoken about the need for the education of mankind and Baltics specifically, and the simple fact of life that it falls upon the educated and the professional to lead. In no other situation would the voice of a professor and a cleaning maid be the same weight - and so they should not be the same weight in politics. For the good of the Baltics, a corporatist meritocratic system needs to be put in place in the Constitutional Convention, no matter what it takes.\n\nThe elderly politician has said his word, and now it falls to the audience to decide whether they shall follow him or declare a soft coup in the Democratic Party."

KRBAT.118.t:0 "Adiamünde Commune"
KRBAT.118.d:0 "Following the Rural Commune acts after the abolition of serfdom in the Baltic provinces, Latvian and Estonian peasantry began to organize into rural communes, the Landgemeinde, which were granted autonomy, democratic self-government and certain powers as well as privileges. Here, a generation of peasants have grown up in largely autonomous and democratic conditions, able to foster their native culture and participate in the process of government.\n\nSometimes, however, these rights can go too far. In the Adiamünde Parish, also known to Latvians as Skulte, the local Landgemeinde has elected Pēteris Briedis as its new elder. Briedis, an inhabitant of the parish who moved to Riga to work in its naval dockyards and joined its trade union movement, is a self-proclaimed Syndicalist, and was elected by the commune with a platform of implementing Syndicalism for the people. While the idea that Syndicalism could be implemented in a small collection of villages would frustrate a left-wing ideologue, this does not affect the locals one bit, who have avowed to build a classless society without exploitation in the heart of the United Baltic Duchy.\n\nThis "Adiamünde Commune" has gained mass exposure in Baltic press, and while it is in the right of a Landgemeinde to elect the government which their inhabitants want, the Baltische Landeswehr calls for a military intervention to remove the Syndicalist local government. The "Adiamünde Commune" will not go down without a fight, however - much like other Landgemeinde, it keeps a small militia to defend its borders, and it seems ready to defend its Syndicalist goals."

BAT_devolved_culture:0 "Devolved Cultural Liberties"

A power struggle has thus broken out within the upper echelons of government and needs to be resolved lest our country falls into anarchy. \n\nWhile §YDualism§! is active, it is impossible to gain £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! normally - it may only be gained through £decision_icon_small §YDecisions§!, in which you can make various concessions to parliamentary groups in order to receive their support.

While a costly measure, it is bound to leave the Baltic German state prepared against any attack should it be implemented completely.\n\nDuring the §YOstwallprogramm§!, you are able to construct §YLand Forts§! and gain defense-oriented §YNational Spirits§! by spending various types of £rifle_texticon §YEquipment§!. The Ostwallprogramm is composed of several stages, completing all construction initiatives in a stage will unlock new, advanced and more expensive decisions to unlock. Completing the §YPurchase Material§! National Focus will grant you permanent decisions to purchase Equipment to spend on Ostwall initiatives - or your own army."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SCHORNER_DESC:0 "Who would have thought that Ferdinand Schörner would one day lead the Kaiser's possessions in East Asia? Despite the vain efforts of his detractors, this is now the case.\n\nBorn in 1892, Schörner joined the Bavarian army in 1911, and fought valiantly during the Weltkrieg, earning his decorations and the rank of lieutenant when the war ended. He was noted for his impressive military leadership and organizational skills, being able to manage a group of over 500,000 men; though some criticized him for his brutality and described him as ruthless. He joined the Von Göring's Alldeutscher Verband once the Weltkreig concluded. Schörner, being very nationalistic and devoted to Germany, participated in several German military expeditions in various countries of the world, which earned him a well-deserved promotion to general.\n\nHe was then assigned to Indochina, where he often clashed with his superiors, particularly with regard to the issue of natives, as Schörner refused to lead units composed of natives, preferring to lead units composed entirely of pure Germans. Schörner wanted the entire colonial army to be composed entirely of Germans instead of 'savages' as he described the natives, he found the local native elites useless in the management of the colony and in the civilizing mission, preferring a purely German ruling caste.\n\nAfter the previous administration lost Indochina to the socialists, Schörner is now in charge of German East Asia and intends to apply his extreme principles and maintain German order there at all costs."
POLITICS_HEYE_DESC:0 "Only the bravest and strongest men dare to venture into the deep and hostile jungles that swarm in the Kaiser's possessions in East Asia, Heye is one of them.\n\nA seasoned and respected veteran of the Weltkrieg, a personal friend of Eric Ludendorff and a lifelong servant of the Kaiser, Heye dedicates his life and his heart to the greatness of the German Empire. Comparable to Von Epp in Mittelafrika, he intends to use the necessary means to maintain order in the colonies that he now directs with an iron fist, promising an administrative as well as military centralization of the colony. The old veteran seems to have alienated the natives, some criticizing his opinions which seem to put the local elites on the side in the management of German East Asia.\n\nThat doesn't matter to Heye, the Kaiser has given him a mission and he intends to carry it out with flying colors as he always does."
POLITICS_BALLIN_DESC:0 "Albert Ballin is one of the most well-known men in Germany in all matters relating to the maritime field. A brilliant businessman, he is the managing director of the Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft, which became the largest shipping company in the world following the German victory in the Weltkrieg. He is notably the inventor of the concept of the cruise ship, creating the SS Augusta Victoria, named after the German empress Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, which was the first modern cruise ship in the world, a demonstration of German intellect and genius.\n\nHis great experience led him to be appointed head of the German East Asia by the Kaiser, Ballin accepted this honor with joy, his happiness always being on the water. His reign was marked by a calm status-quo maintained for decades, the colony seems to be doing well both financially and in terms of stability despite an increase in socialist resistance in Indochina; with rebels directly funded by the Third International.\n\nHowever, despite this unflappable calm, Albert Ballin is an old man and many believe that the days of the old German shipping magnate are now numbered, with the question of his succession becoming more relevant by the day. "
POLITICS_JOSIAS_DESC:0 "Prince Josias zu Waldeck und Pyrmont is the crown prince of the Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont, son of Frederick of Waldeck-Pyrmont, and general in the Kaiser's army. It was only natural that Josias enlisted in the Imperial Army as a cadet when the Weltkrieg broke out in Europe. While during the war he was seriously wounded, he miraculously managed to survive.\nJosias’ father; disappointed with his military performance, convinced the Kaiser to send him to East Asia in order to redeem his poor performance. However o his father's surprise, Josias found himself to be a competent military and colonial administrator, becoming very close to the shipping magnate and head of German East Asia: Albert Ballin. Supporting Ballin's policies and decisions, he helped him greatly in implementing them, with many considering him the old man's right-hand man, which gave him a privileged position to succeed Ballin.\n\nThe following is now the case. Now Josias zu Waldeck und Pyrmont is well and truly at the head of the colony, now counting on maintaining the unshakeable status-quo by continuing the policies of his predecessor. His father can now be proud of him, it remains to be seen whether or not Josias will manage to preserve the integrity of the colony, or if the circling Socialist dogs in Indochina will drag German East Asia to hell."
POLITICS_HELLMUTH_VON_MUCKE_DESC:0 "Hellmuth von Mücke is the very definition of a sailor, always looking for new discoveries, new waves to sail on and fascinating indigenous people to meet.\n\nHe became known as the leader of a small group of German sailors, who, during the Weltkrieg, were stranded in the Indian Ocean, succeeding, after many adventures, to escape with his crew during a long journey that took him to Indonesia, where he succeeded in embarking for the Hejaz. They then planned to go up to Constantionople to arrive in a safe place, they had to cross Arabia, where they stopped in Mecca and were attacked by Bedouins, then they had to travel through Syria, to finally arrive triumphantly in the Ottoman capital, where a ceremony was organized and honors were given to Hellmuth and his crew.\n\nReceiving the rank of captain, he was assigned to German East Asia following the war, he took the opportunity to discover more closely the very diverse native peoples who inhabited the colony. He became one of the most important advocates for an extension of the political, religious and economic rights of the natives, a decentralization of the colony as well as a policy of respect for the customs and beliefs of the native peoples. The Grand Admiral is notable for close ties to the Reformgruppe present in Mittelafrika. Now in power in the colony, von Mücke, with the support of like-minded administrators as well as local elites and native peoples, intends to lead the colony into a brighter future."
POLITICS_FELIX_VON_LUCKNER_DESC:0 "Sailing the seas since he was a boy and rising to be one of the Kaiser’s greatest naval commanders, Felix Nikolaus Alexander Georg Graf von Luckner is one of the most renowned sailors to ever set sail. Born in Dresden in 1881 into a prominent military family, the young Felix was under constant pressure to join the cavalry corp like his father. Unable to take this pressure, Luckner ran away from home at the age of 13. Taking a fake name, ‘Phylax Lüdecke’ was able to get an unpaid cabin boy job on an old Russian sailing ship bound for Australia. Despite nearly dying on the voyage, the young von Luckner took to sea life quickly. After arriving in Australia, the boy took numerous odd jobs to survive which would take him around the world, including being a labourer, a barman, a boxer, a kangaroo hunter, a circus performer, a fisherman, a lighthouse keeper, a guard for the Mexican president, and even serving jail time in a Chilean prison for stealing some pigs, all before reaching the age of 20. Upon his release from jail, he made his way back to Germany, where he entered the nautical navigation school to learn to be a true sailor. From there, he would work on a steamer-line based in Hamburg before finally returning to his family and being called into the Kaiser’s naval service in 1912, just two years before the Weltkrieg. It was in this war that von Luckner would earn his fame, serving first on the SMS Panther where he would earn a name for himself as a brilliant naval officer. Trouncing the British navy at every meeting, the Anglos began to fear von Luckner, earning him his famed moniker ‘Der Seeteufel’, or the Sea Devil. After numerous victories, the Kaiser gifted von Luckner with an impounded three-masted ship, which was rebranded as the Seeadler, or Sea Eagle, and given to von Luckner to command. Outfitted with modern cannons, the Sea Devil and his ‘Piraten des Kaisers’ revived naval mercantile raiding and used it to great effect to tie up the supply lines of the British. Following the war, von Luckner continued to serve the Kaiser, raiding enemy shipping lanes and sinking rogue vessels all across the Seven Seas, earning new honors along the way until he finally landed him in German East Asia under the command of Hellmuth von Mücke. Now, with the failures of Solf and Mücke causing much of German East Asia to fall, von Luckner the Sea Devil has inherited their command, and under his watch, German East Asia shall be tamed for the Kaiser once more, assuming this old pirate doesn’t simply take matters into his own hands..."

### Focuses ###
GEA_mission1:0 "Status of the Admiralty"
GEA_mission1_desc:0 "With the annexation of the French Colonies and the incorporation of the British Territories, German East Asia is a unique colonial authority unique in its control. With Grand Admiral Hellmuth von Mücke and the Ostasienflotte temporarily ruling over the Colony after Ballin's death, we must review the status of our continuing mission to protect the colonies from outside aggressors and how best this can be achieved."
GEA_army1:0 "The Ostasien Force"
GEA_army1_desc:0 "The Ostasien Force is currently a divided mix between Ostasien marines, local garrison units and fresh recruits from Berlin. We must take stock and decide whether to focus more on recruiting locals or further strengthen our forces from the Fatherland."
GEA_military1:0 "Request Arms from Berlin"
GEA_military1_desc:0 "We still lack reasonable military-industrial facilities, leaving us reliant on Berlin for supplies. Until we have the opportunity to establish a domestic supply we should request additional rifles from the homeland."
GEA_military2:0 "Request Modern Artillery"
GEA_military2_desc:0 "Our existing artillery pieces are rusted relics from even before the Weltkrieg, to better protect our colonies we should request modern pieces from Berlin."
GEA_military3:0 "Request Further Arms Supplies"
GEA_military3_desc:0 "With tensions ramping up further within the region we must bolster our standing forces even more. We shall send a request to Berlin for further equipment."
GEA_germantroops1:0 "A German Force"
GEA_germantroops1_desc:0 "The natives aren't fit to defend and die for the Kaiser. We must continue relying on German Troops even if it reduces our total force size."
GEA_germantroops2:0 "Prussian Discipline"
GEA_germantroops2_desc:0 "Our army should embody the spririt of the warriors that won us the Weltkrieg, strict discipline and military honour of the highest order."
GEA_germantroops3:0 "Enlist the Military Police"
GEA_germantroops3_desc:0 "Currently our Military Police exists in a generally informal state with only small arms that they use on patrol. As we are in need of extra men we should seek to arm these MP units and incorporate them as auxilliaries."
GEA_germantroops4:0 "Request Prussian Guards from Berlin"
GEA_germantroops4_desc:0 "If we are to secure our colonies and protect them from fanatical aggressors then we need equally fanatical troops. We shall send a request to Berlin for a new shock trooper division to help us shore up our defences."
GEA_localtroops1:0 "Use the Locals"
GEA_localtroops1_desc:0 "While the natives will never match up to German force and Prussian discipline the simple fact is that there are more of them than us. Numbers win wars after all, not pagentary."
GEA_localtroops2:0 "Native Garrisons"
GEA_localtroops2_desc:0 "It is true we have a large native population, and while they might not fight and die like a German for us, they will fight and die for their own people. We should raise a series of Garrison divisions and station them within their own regions."
GEA_localtroops3:0 "Breach the Language Barrier"
GEA_localtroops3_desc:0 "Our Forces are plagued with communication issues due to the convoluted network of languages and translators within the armed service. We will solve this by devolving further powers to regimental officers on language and force compositions to negate these problems."
GEA_localtroops4:0 "Formal Rights for Service"
GEA_localtroops4_desc:0 "Our Colonial Subjects do not currently enjoy the same rights as a German citizen even if they serve within the armed forces. To attract more recruits this must change, and service should be honoured."
GEA_budget1:0 "Fiscal Austerity"
GEA_budget1_desc:0 "With the global financial crisis emanating from Berlin we must cut back on our spending and increase our revenue immediately or suffer an enormous budgetary deficit."
GEA_budget2:0 "A Colonial Mark"
GEA_budget2_desc:0 "Unlike our friends in Afrika, we have never made serious efforts to encourage use of the Ostasienmark since its introduction in 1927. By requiring its use we will increase uniformity across the colonies and improve our ability to collect revenue."
GEA_budget3:0 "Share our Burden"
GEA_budget3_desc:0 "Local European settlers have long benefited from our protection and have paid very little tax in exchange for the order they enjoy. But since we rely on their cooperation to run the colonies, and cannot go too far, it would be better to forge an agreement with them."
GEA_budget4:0 "Reinforce Colonial Bureaucracy"
GEA_budget4_desc:0 "German East Asia has never had a fully functional administration to implement its will. Now in the wake of colonial turmoil it's time to expand the bureaucracy and establish direct rule over our colonies."
GEA_budget5:0 "[GetNameGEAIndochina] Pacification"
GEA_budget5_desc:0 "[GetNameGEAIndochina], is a key part of the Deutsch-Ostasien administration and an economic centre. With the spectre of Vietcong insurgents looming it only stands to reason that it be pacified and fortified."
GEA_budget6:0 "Factories of Singapur"
GEA_budget6_desc:0 "[GetNameGEASingapore] is currently lacking any meaningful heavy industry. Certain German corporations are interested in making the jump to Asia but request our backing for their investments before they start. New factories will increase employment and stabilise the situation."
GEA_budget7:0 "Malaya Pacification"
GEA_budget7_desc:0 "Malaya is the shining jewel of German East-Asia and the operational centre of our entire administration, but in the wake of Black Monday it has been disturbed by violent insurgency. We should seek to introduce a system of posts, bunkers and bastions to pacify the local insurgents. This will also benefit us in the case of enemy land-based assault."
GEA_budget8:0 "[GetNameGEAIndochina] Investments"
GEA_budget8_desc:0 "The textile mills of [GetNameGEAIndochina] cry out for further funding to expand and innovate in new garment-making techniques. Providing this funding would endear us to the locals and bring in new revenue long-term. This will help the economic recovery and stabilisation of society."
GEA_budget9:0 "Local Arms Foundries"
GEA_budget9_desc:0 "The Current arms manufacturers within our area of jurisdiction are sorely lacking to say the least. We should invest in further developing new designs and facilities to lessen our reliance on Berlin's scraps."
GEA_budget10:0 "Protect Tsingtau"
GEA_budget10_desc:0 "Our troops fought and bled to the last men to defend Tsingtau during the Weltkrieg, these brave and stalwart men make up a large portion of [GEA.GetLeader]'s inner circle and they press him to better defend their object of desire."
GEA_budget11:0 "Authorise Local Arms Production"
GEA_budget11_desc:0 "Currently many of our treaties forbid the native authorities and princes from establishing arms production as a condition of our protection. With the reforms that have taken place to the basic structure of our government we have come to regard these restrictions as an outmoded hindrance and are keen to remove them."
GEA_budget12:0 "Siamese Border Fortifications"
GEA_budget12_desc:0 "While the Kingdom of Siam did assist the German Empire during the Weltkrieg they were not rewarded with their full territorial claims, on which we currently sit. We should fortify the border just in case they decide that weapons speak louder than words."
GEA_budget13:0 "Lessons from Mittelafrika"
GEA_budget13_desc:0 "Mittelafrika is our sister project of sorts, has been dealing with native discontent since it's inception. We are sure to benefit in hiring Mittelafrikanisch advisors."
GEA_budget14:0 "Fortress Hainan"
GEA_budget14_desc:0 "Hainan is an important staging post for operations in Southern China and along the Indochinese Coast. We should seek to fortify the island."
GEA_budget15:0 "Counter-Insurgency Lessons"
GEA_budget15_desc:0 "The Mittelafrikanisch colonial forces have extensive experience, hard and bloodily won, in defeating local rebels and insurgents. With a more permanent military attache be established, it has allowed for new doctrines and tactics to be employed. Though this has resulted in a higher failure rate in recruitment, the results speak for themselves."
GEA_budget16:0 "Deployment of the Flüssigkeitsbrandbombe"
GEA_budget16_desc:0 "Mittelafrikan terrain is filled with thick vegetation and jungles, because of this they have introduced a new weapon: the Flüssigkeitsbrandbombe 'the Liquid Fire Bomb', to bomb the insurgents in the dense foliage of Africa. Its use of White phosphorus is truly breathtaking, though its effect on the enemy has been seen as quite distasteful by the more traditional members of the Admiralty."
GEA_budget17:0 "Valkyries of the Battlefield"
GEA_budget17_desc:0 "Due to the poor infrastructure and rough terrain in which our troops operate we frequently have difficulty extracting wounded men, leading to deaths from wounds that would otherwise be treatable. The use of native strecher bearers has been a god send, who know the lay of the land. They have been dubbed "Valkyries" by the soldiers, as they lift those who will live and triage those who will die."
GEA_air1:0 "Singapur Flying Corps"
GEA_air1_desc:0 "Our current aerial forces are entirely comprised of our Naval Aviation detachment. We should seek to find and train additional pilots for a land based air force."
GEA_air2:0 "Weihaiwei Airbases"
GEA_air2_desc:0 "Weihaiwei, shared with the AOG, is the perfect position from which to project our aerial might across the entire region. In theory, we are able to strike Qing, Fengtian and even Japan, all from one base. We should now seek to expand it to facilitate these options."
GEA_air3:0 "Aerial Exercises"
GEA_air3_desc:0 "Our Pilots must be trained in the best conditions possible to suit our needs, we shall stage aerial wargames over Tsingtau to show our rivals that we mean business."
GEA_air4:0 "Focke-Wulf East Asian Subsidiary"
GEA_air4_desc:0 "Focke-Wulf have expressed interest in opening an East Asian Subsidiary to take advantage of our local labour and resources. We should fuly support them in this venture."
GEA_air5:0 "East Asian Fallschirmjäger"
GEA_air5_desc:0 "Grand Admiral von Mücke has long admired the Fallschimjäger and their strong discipline. Recently he has made contact with the "Wolf" Dietrich Witzel who has offered to train and command an elite division here in the East; an offer we cannot refuse."
GEA_air6:0 "Request Fighters from Berlin"
GEA_air6_desc:0 "While we are now producing some planes locally we still require more than we can currently produce. We shall request a quartet of fighters from Berlin to fill the gap in the meantime."
GEA_navy1:0 "The Grand Fleet"
GEA_navy1_desc:0 "The Ostasienflotte is the largest and grandest outside of Europe and forms the core of our operations in East Asia; a shining testament to our commitment to the present order. Our primary foe within the region is of course the Empire of Japan and their own considerable fleet. Keeping our grand fleet in port forces the Japanese to use significant naval assets to keep it on watch."
GEA_navy2:0 "The Ostasien Fleet in the 1934 Naval Plan"
GEA_navy2_desc:0 "East Asia, perhaps moreso than anywhere else, depends upon German naval power to protect her scattered islands and bases. Therefore while the majority of the Fatherland's resources are devoted to the extremely prestigious Hochseeflotte, the 1934 Naval Plan makes significant provisions for our navy's expansion."
GEA_fleet1:0 "The Fleet In Being"
GEA_fleet1_desc:0 "The present disposition of the Hochseeflotte is that through superior force and occasional, devastating sorties we will win command of the sea. By following them in this school of thought we can ensure that orthodox German naval doctrine is maintained across all fleets."
GEA_fleet_2:0 "Modern Destroyers"
GEA_fleet_2_desc:0 "Destroyers are the backbone of a modern navy. We should revamp and redesign our own to a higher standard."
GEA_battlecruiser1:0 "Command of the Sea"
GEA_battlecruiser1_desc:0 "The Ostasienflotte has only one future priority: to defeat the Japanese in the event of a war. This means that our doctrinal efforts should be focused to exploit their weaknesses. Japan relies heavily on imports from her puppets and posessions. Therefore, by aiming at trade disruption, we can deal an outsized blow."
GEA_battlecruiser2:0 "Colonial Battlecruisers"
GEA_battlecruiser2_desc:0 "While battleships and colossal dreadnoughts are the mainstay of the German navy, local East-Asian shipbuilding lacks the enormous dockyards and access to steel that mainland Germany has. Accordingly we intend to further the use of battlecruisers, a type of armoured cruiser with heavier arms but weaker armour that has largely fallen out of favour with the world's naval powers. They shall suit our needs perfectly."
GEA_strikegroup1:0 "Aviation School"
GEA_strikegroup1_desc:0 "While German doctrine holds that naval aviation's only purpose is in reconnaissance, the Grand Admiral is afforded a surprising degree of freedom over the disposition of his forces. To that end, if he so chooses, we could begin investing much more time into the school of thought that holds air power to be the future of naval power, though it would be sure to attract controversy in Berlin."
GEA_strikegroup2:0 "Light Cruisers"
GEA_strikegroup2_desc:0 "Lightly armoured cruisers, displacing less than 5000 tonnes, are quite frequently the key to building a mobile naval force; be that for raiding convoys bringing war material to Japan, or escorting carriers to project air power in the Pacific.

### Events ###
# Introduction event
Ostasien.0.t:0 "Pearl of the Orient"
Ostasien.0.d:0 "Ever since the British collapse in 1926, the Kaiserliche Marine has been the undisputed master of the Eastern Seas, and the guardian of the western order in the Orient. The retreat of the British 'China Station' to Australasia left her Asian colonies and concessions vulnerable to native socialist insurrection, and in need of protection only Germany could offer, completing a string of colonies and concessions from Suez to Tsingtau. This glorious achievement came at a cost, however.\n\nOur expansion in the East was unusual in its rapidity and scale, bringing our jurisdiction over a diverse and complicated series of colonies divorced from their metropole; forced to acknowlege our superiority and yet all too byzantine to reconstruct or totally reorder, lest they collapse and bring our administration with them. Thus, German East Asia exists not as a colony, or even formally as an authority, but instead as a jurisdiction; a stretch of territory in which the relatively impartial admiralty must at once balance local interests, contend with varying colonial systems, and ensure the protection of it all.\n\nDespite our dominance, Japan remains a threat, determined as ever to push us out of the East and claim it for itself; our brave soldiers staring theirs down over the Legation Cities, and our glorious battleships vigilant across the seas.\n\nLooking past matters of internal difficulty, there may yet be a reckoning and it is the Admiralty's duty to ensure that when the time comes, it is ready."
Ostasien.0.a:0 "Sehr Gut!"
Ostasien.0.b:0 "What about China?"

Ostasien.1.t:0 "China and the AOG"
Ostasien.1.d:0 "The Fatherland's Chinese possessions also lie under our jurisdiction, and as per the terms of the American-mediated Shanghai Conference of 1928, Germany's rights in China are equal to those of any other foreign power. The city of Tsingtau has long served as the nexus of our operations there, at once a modern city, a thriving port, and the center of an extensive commerical web woven throughout the East.\n\nNot everything passing through Kiaochow Bay is fully legitimate, however. The Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, or Supervisory Board of the East Asian General Administration, manages numerous ships, factories, and even informal concessions which violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the 1928 agreement.\n\nThe Nanjing Warlord Sun Chuanfang, in a bid to ensure his autonomy from China's central government, accepted a series of exploitative arms deals in return for extensive economic concessions within the League of Eight Provinces. Although unrecognized by Beijing, as well as the rest of the international community, the AOG spreads its influence throughout the League and ever deeper into the country's interior.\n\nUltimately Berlin would like us to use China as a buffer of sorts against Japan; every soldier spent there is one who cannot be deployed against us in Malaya and Indochina. To that end, China's government and the LEP must be supported, and Japanese encroachment in China must be considered only one step away from [GetNameGEASingapore]."
Ostasien.1.a:0 "Sehr Gut!"

# Black Monday
Ostasien.2.t:0 "Black Monday!"
Ostasien.2.d:0 "The situation in Germany is dire. After a devastating financial crisis, the German economy is in tatters, and the colonies are sure to follow. We must cut back on much of our spending and immediately look for ways to buttress East Asia's already weakening economy and as a start the Reichskolonialamt has relayed orders from Berlin to relocate "unnecessary" garrisons from League ports. Recovery could take many years..."
Ostasien.2.a:0 "Disastrous!"

Ostasien.3.t:0 "The End of the Black Week"
Ostasien.3.d:0 "A week has passed since the initial Berlin Stock Market Crash. Rubber and tin, our main export commodities, have already lost more than half of their pre-Black Monday value due to the collapse of tire demand from the automotive industry. Meanwhile, rice exports to the European market have ground to a halt, leaving tens of thousands of tons rotting in the fields and on the docks. Europeans in Singapore, Saigon, and other cities with few savings and no land ownership gambled and lost everything on the market, and now find themselves little better off than their Indochinese neighbours."
Ostasien.3.a:0 "Something must be done!"

### Uprising Chain ###
# Yen Bai Muytiny
Ostasien.4.t:0 "Instability in Indochina"
Ostasien.4.d:0 "Since our expeditionary army destroyed Ho Chi Minh and his syndicalist agitators in Guangzhou ten years ago, Indochina has enjoyed a relatively stable period. But the recent Berlin Stock Market Crash, or Black Monday, has had a devastating impact on the highly commercialised Indochinese economy. Strikes and rice riots are spreading in Tonkin, Annam and Cochinchina. Urban students and intellectuals ask for more freedom. What's worse, our intelligence suggests some underground revolutionaries are secretly spreading their influence."
Ostasien.4.a:0 "This colony is notorious for insubordination."

Ostasien.5.t:0 "Nationalist Agitation in Tonkin"
Ostasien.5.d:0 "We have uncovered a series of nationalist and anti-colonialist movements in Tonkin. In every corner of Hanoi agitators are disseminating pamphlets calling for national unity and independence. The ringleader behind the agitations is a group called the Vietnamese Nationalist Party(VNQDD), and our agents have discovered an insidious plan: these bandits are infiltrating our garrison in Tonkin."
Ostasien.5.a:0 "We must prepare."

Ostasien.6.t:0 "Yen-Bai Mutiny"
Ostasien.6.d:0 "Today some Tonkinese garrisons in Yen-Bai, a military post near the Sino-Indochinese border, organised a mutiny against the colonial officials! Along with them are armed infiltrators of VNQDD. Thanks to our agents, we sabotaged their plan to launch a coordinated uprising. We have fended off the rebels and begun a large-scale crackdown in Tonkin. Now the desperate rebels are fleeing to the mountainous area on the Sino-Vietnamese border."
Ostasien.6.a:0 "Concentrate our force to crush these bandits!"
Ostasien.6.b:0 "Declare martial law in all Indochina!"

Ostasien.7.t:0 "An Indochinese Tragedy" # FRA
Ostasien.7.d:0 ""Viet-Nam! Viet-Nam! Viet-Nam! Homeland of the South! Thirteen times, I heard the outcry in front of the guillotine of Yen-Bai. Thirteen men sentenced to death shouted it, one by one, two metres away from climbing the scaffold."\n\n— A French journalist Louis Roubaud witnessed the recent brutal German crackdown in Indochina, our former colony and the current bastion of German colonialism in the Far East. Now General Jacques Doriot, a close friend of the late Indochinese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh spoke for an intervention in Indochina. Since the end of the Weltkrieg, thousands of Indochinese students, soldiers and workers have stayed in France and become firm revolutionaries. If we send them back with sufficient arms, they can organise an uprising in Cochinchina. This could destabilise the German colonial empire and serve the world revolution."
Ostasien.7.a:0 "Bon voyage, Indochinese comrades!"
Ostasien.7.b:0 "We are not the modern Pigneau de Behaine."

Ostasien.8.t:0 "An Indochinese Tragedy" # BHC
Ostasien.8.d:0 ""Viet Nam! Viet Nam! Viet Nam! Homeland of the South! Thirteen times, I heard the outcry in front of the guillotine of Yen-Bai. Thirteen men sentenced to death shouted it, one by one, two metres away from climbing the scaffold."\n\n— A French journalist Louis Roubaud witnessed the recent brutal German crackdown in Indochina, the bastion of German colonialism in the Far East. Now the Indochinese revolutionaries in Calcutta are lobbying for assistance. If we send equipment and volunteers, with German police and gendarmes occupied in Tonkin, the Indochinese revolutionaries can organise an uprising in Cochinchina. This could destabilise the German colonial empire. This will be an important step in our international revolution project."
Ostasien.8.a:0 "Send our help."
Ostasien.8.b:0 "We are not interested."

# Bao Dai Reform
Ostasien.9.t:0 "Emperor Bao Dai Returns to Indochina"
Ostasien.9.d:0 "Bao Dai, the monarch of Annam, has recently finished his studies in Germany and returned to Indochina. Unfortunately he is not satisfied with a mere ceremonious role, but a carefully controlled monarchy would allow us to mitigate rural instability and win over the support of the people, since Annamese peasants are innately attached to their Emperor. However, the European settlers in Saigon staunchly oppose any attempt to share power with the Annamese."
Ostasien.9.a:0 "Welcome, our puppet emperor."
Ostasien.9.b:0 "Maybe he should continue his studies."

Ostasien.10.t:0 "Bao Dai's Reforms: The First Step"
Ostasien.10.d:0 "Having ascended to the throne, Bao Dai has recruited several reform-minded figures into his court, including Neo-traditionalist intellectual Pham Quynh and Catholic administrator Ngo Dinh Diem. Now his ministers have decided to initiate an administrative reform to revitalise the dysfunctional bureaucratic system. Currently the mandarins in the protectorate of Annam only nominally run the country, while their European advisers hold true power. Bao Dai's reform will certainly damage the European monopolisation of power."
Ostasien.10.a:0 "It is necessary."
Ostasien.10.b:0 "Stop him. He has gone too far."

Ostasien.11.t:0 "Bao Dai's Reforms: The Second Step"
Ostasien.11.d:0 "After the administrative reform, Bao Dai's cabinet has begun to further centralise power. The recent turmoil in Indochina offers him a good excuse. He implores us to grant him authority to set up an imperial police force. Bao Dai and his ministers argue that only imperial police carrying order from the imperial court in Hue can effectively pacify the disobedient peasants and restore order in Annam."
Ostasien.11.a:0 "It will help."
Ostasien.11.b:0 "Giving the Annamese power is dangerous."

# Revolution in Cochinchina

Ostasien.12.t:0 "Instability in Cochinchina"
Ostasien.12.d:0 "With our forces occupied suppressing the nationalists in Tonkin, the situation to the south in Cochinchina is growing increasingly unstable. Strikes have decreased but trade union activists are reported to be holding frequent meetings, and rumors are spreading that agitators, disguised as monks and merchants, are organising peasants into secret societies in Cochinchina and southern Annam. Additional Intelligence suggests many Vietnamese exiles are illegally crossing the border and entering Indochina. They are likely to be sent by foreign powers to engage in subversive activities. Our officials have invented a new term: "Vietcong", in full Viet Nam Cong Doan (Vietnamese Syndicalist), to designate these red threats."
Ostasien.12.a:0 "I sense the calm before the storm."

Ostasien.13.t:0 "Jailbreak at Poulo Condor"
Ostasien.13.d:0 "This morning our central prison on Poulo Condor island reported a mass jailbreak! This was clearly a well-organised action; the prisoners escaped through a tunnel under cover of midnight, then embarked on pre-prepared junks and disappeared into the canal networks and marshes of the Mekong Delta. It's estimated that some 150 out of the total 25,000 prisoners escaped. Most are left-wing agitators."
Ostasien.13.a:0 "This colony has been nothing but trouble!"

Ostasien.14.t:0 "Binh Dinh Commune Movement"
Ostasien.14.d:0 "Binh Dinh province, the home of Tay Son rebellion, is witnessing a dramatic escalation of its peasant movement. Demonstrators initially demanded an end to corvée labour, an equivalent to serfdom, but when they were ignored by local administrators angry peasants began to burn down administrative buildings, town halls and railway stations; destroy tax registers, and pillage police stations. The local administration has been paralysed and associations called "communes" have been formed, and the movement has begun to spread to other provinces in southern Annam and Mekong. Clearly the Vietcong are behind all these movements!"
Ostasien.14.a:0 "Perhaps we can deal with this peacefully."
Ostasien.14.b:0 "Send in the troops!"

Ostasien.15.t:0 "Saigon Uprising"
Ostasien.15.d:0 "Yesterday concerted insurgencies simultaneously broke out from Tonkin to Cochinchina. Trade Unions went into general strike and tried to occupy municipal government buildings. While in most places order has been restored, the Vietcong brought their peasant rebellion from Binh Dinh and Mekong to Saigon and entered the city. Local garrisons defected and rebels seized control of key communications and administrative facilities in Saigon!"
Ostasien.15.a:0 "Vive la Revolution! (Switch to INC)"
Ostasien.15.b:0 "Damn the Vietcong!"

Ostasien.16.t:0 "Situation in Indochina Deteriorates"
Ostasien.16.d:0 "The situation in Indochina has deteriorated, with the insurgents being much harder than we thought to pacify. Vietcong regular forces are pushing northward while their guerrilla units harass our logistics and spread fear. Many settlers doubt if we can hold Indochina anymore and demand an evacuation of valuable assets to other colonies."
Ostasien.16.a:0 "Evacuate assets!"
Ostasien.16.b:0 "Everything is alright!"

Ostasien.17.t:0 "Situation in Indochina Deteriorates"
Ostasien.17.d:0 "It seems that, although official reports from our far eastern colonies claim significant successes in suppressing the insurgency, according to military intelligence the situation in Indochina has actually deteriorated. Pacifying the Vietcong rebels seems to have been more than the admiralty could handle. Some major cities and strategic positions have fallen into rebel hands; fear and turmoil are spreading. Maybe German East Asia needs some help?"
Ostasien.17.a:0 "They can handle this."
Ostasien.17.b:0 "Send reinforcements!"
Ostasien.17.c:0 "A land war in Asia? Tally ho!"

Ostasien.18.t:0 "Indochinese Union Sends Peace Initiative"
Ostasien.18.d:0 "The uprisings in Indochina have worsened. Key positions have fallen to Vietcong bandits and we are struggling to cope. Now Indochinese rebels send us an initiative of peace talk. Despite concerns that this will be considered as a humiliation, a wise move might be to give up control of the region."
Ostasien.18.a:0 "No, we will keep fighting these rebels!"
Ostasien.18.b:0 "We can't afford fighting anymore."

Ostasien.19.t:0 "Peace Talks Failed"
Ostasien.19.d:0 "German imperialists refused our peace initiative and decided to continue the war."
Ostasien.19.a:0 "Only guns can talk to the imperialists!"

Ostasien.20.t:0 "Victory in Indochina"
Ostasien.20.d:0 "Germany accepted the peace initiative and retreat from the Indochinese peninsula. We have fulfilled the mission of forcing German imperialists to withdraw. Indochina is now liberated from the German colonial regime! This is a great victory for our people and a major defeat for the German Imperialists and their lackeys."
Ostasien.20.a:0 "Pickelhaube go home!"

Ostasien.21.t:0 "Good News, Bad News"
Ostasien.21.d:0 "It seems that Berlin is concerned with the situation in Indochina. The bad news is, they discovered the fact that we are not doing well and harshly criticised us. The good news is, they've sent reinforcements to suppress Vietcong insurgents."
Ostasien.21.a:0 "Good News."

Ostasien.22.t:0 "Victory in Indochina"
Ostasien.22.d:0 "Our glorious army has managed to thwart the Vietcong revolt in Indochina! This is a glorious day for Germany!"
Ostasien.22.a:0 "Sehr gut, Kameraden!"

Ostasien.23.t:0 "Eascalation of War in Indochina"
Ostasien.23.d:0 "With German Empire committing its main force to Indochinese peninsula, the resistance war has escalated to an unprecedented level! But we will triumph, for the just cause of liberation is invincible. It's also rumoured that other great powers are trying to transform Indochinese peninsula into a quagmire for Germany..."
Ostasien.23.a:0 "Fight!"

Ostasien.25.t:0 "Bao Dai Solution" # Extra
Ostasien.25.d:0 "With Cochinchina fallen to the Vietcong and guerrillas rising everywhere, the whole of Indochina is in a state of emergency. Local elites and anti-syndicalist nationalists have rallied behind Emperor Bao Dai and propose a solution: If we honour the protectorate treaty, which means granting Nguyen Dynasty greater autonomy in Annam as well as Tonkin, they will help to pacify the rural areas, mobilise local resources and defeat the rebels. Otherwise, the prevalent anti-colonialist sentiment will give the Vietcong an edge. Bao Dai's missive ends ominously, stating that if Germany doesn't respond to Vietnamese nationalism, 'Every village will be a nest of resistance, each former collaborator an enemy, and your officials and colonists will themselves seek to leave this atmosphere, which will choke them.'"
Ostasien.25.b:0 "We can handle it ourselves."
Ostasien.25.a:0 "We need his help."
Ostasien.25.c:0 "Bao Dai will lead Annam to peace and order (Play as Vietnam)"

Ostasien.30.t:0 "Falling Prices"
Ostasien.30.d:0 "The prices of rice and rubber are rapidly falling across the colonies. The farmers and plantation owners, relying on rice and rubber exports, have been hit hard, especially in our two major colonies of Indochina and Malaya. It's possible to control the price in one colony, but our resources are limited, and this will almost certainly come at the cost of the other?"
Ostasien.30.a:0 "This is not our business."
Ostasien.30.b:0 "Protect Indochina."
Ostasien.30.c:0 "Protect Malaya."

Ostasien.32.t:0 "Plantation Strikes"
Ostasien.32.d:0 "The price of rubber keeps falling. Many plantation owners have decided to fire workers and keep the rest working full time. These decisions have triggered large-scale strikes in plantations in Indochina and Malaya. Workers are demanding employers stop firing employees, and they call for shorter working hours with better conditions. Since most plantation workers are illiterate, it's suspected that socialist agitators are behind their coordination."
Ostasien.32.a:0 "Suppress the strikes."
Ostasien.32.b:0 "Try to negotiate with them."

Ostasien.31.t:0 "European Privileges"
Ostasien.31.d:0 "With the shock of Black Monday, many European settlers have lost everything and become impoverished overnight. Now some have petitioned us to strengthen their social and commercial privileges so that, as settlers, they will not be reduced to living like mere colonial subjects. They argue that a strict racial caste system is the only way to ensure the peace in our colonies."
Ostasien.31.a:0 "Reject Them."
Ostasien.31.b:0 "Reinforce European Privilege."

Ostasien.33.t:0 "The Binh Dinh Commune Movement is Pacified"
Ostasien.33.d:0 "The peasant rebellion in Binh Dinh province has been pacified by our soldiers. Bombers and naval gunfire have proven especially effective in intimidating Vietnamese farmers. Binh Dinh, in Vietnamese, means pacification, and now it has really lived up to its name."
Ostasien.33.a:0 "Excellent!"

Ostasien.34.d:0 "The sound of rain falling on the deserted square is deafening. A tattered pamphlet, thrown in the gutter -- the ink running out across the paper in soft blueish blooms -- is the only thing that still serves as proof that Saigon was, up until just recently, a hotbed of radical socialist and syndicalist agitation. Depicted on the pamphlet is a Vietnamese worker holding a socialist red flag. The pamphlet reads: 'Workers of Indochina, unite!'. It is soon swept away by the rain and down into the sewers whence it came."

Ostasien.51.d.a:0 "With Albert Ballin’s sudden death, the honorable Hellmuth von Mücke took command of the East Asian Garrison, and in the wake of the Indochinese Revolt, he commanded the Deutsch-Ostasien fleet with great effectiveness. However, despite his naval prowess, the revolt was fought and lost in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia, and now our colony is massively neutered in the wake of this terrible loss. With much of our mainland territory now lost to native insurrection and our forces thoroughly beaten, we have far too much on our agenda now to be able to do any of the potential reforms the von Mücke regime was planning. The navy shall once again be the main and only focus of Germany’s East Asian possessions, and [root.getleader] shall rule this wartorn colony like a tight ship as he works to consolidate the colony and find his bearings in this new harsh reality he now finds himself in."
Ostasien.51.d.b:0 "With Albert Ballin’s sudden death, the honorable Hellmuth von Mücke took command of the East Asian Garrison, and in the wake of the Indochinese Revolt, he commanded the Deutsch-Ostasien fleet with great effectiveness. With his naval prowess on full display as he commanded the combined arms of Germany’s East Asian forces, the revolt was put down decisively and now our colony stands victorious. However, with much of the colony now in flames or already destroyed by the devastation of war, we have far too much on our agenda now to be able to do any of the potential reforms the von Mücke regime was planning. The navy shall once again be the main and only focus of Germany’s East Asian possessions, and [root.getleader] shall rule this wartorn colony like a tight ship as he works to consolidate the colony and find his bearings in this new harsh reality he now finds himself in."
Ostasien.51.d.c:0 "With Albert Ballin’s sudden death, the honorable Hellmuth von Mücke took command of the East Asian Garrison, and under his steady and measured command, German East Asia has prospered. The primacy of the navy has been put in check and the long-brewing tensions between native elements and the German Garrison have been diplomatically handled, with the most notable new development being the reaffirmed cooperation between Vietnamese monarch Bao Dai and the von Mücke administration. As rebel cells die down and lose power and German influence once again washes over this tropical paradise, [root.getleader] is now prepared to finally embark on his planned reforms that would see this backwards Navy-with-a-State transformed into a working colony."

Ostasien.5101.t:0 "Cashing in Our Promises"
Ostasien.5101.d:0 "Though the brewing sentiment of revolution has died down and the threat of all-out war is no longer looming on the horizon, the peoples of German East Asia still vocally call for reform and change. If we want to keep the progress we have made here in the pursuit of peace and stability, it would be wise for our regime to finally begin to make good on the tacit promises we made in our effort to stop the potential uprising. Chiefly, the local citizens of the colony desire true representation in the colonial government, so that their concerns and complaints can be actively heeded. We could simply ignore these calls for change, but if we do we must be wary of rising seperatist tensions once more."
Ostasien.5101.a:0 "We shall begin the process of opening up the government to the natives."
Ostasien.5101.b:0 "We have reaffirmed our strength. Tell the natives to get lost."

Ostasien.5102.t:0 "A Native Parliament?"
Ostasien.5102.d:0 "The first major demand of the local non-colonial citizens is to finally be given true representation in the colonial government. Demanding that a new lower house be added to the German colonial legislature, this new chamber would be open to natives of German East Asia, so that the best among them may rise up to represent themselves and their peoples before the German regime. However, to prevent unsavory elements and possible radicals from flooding this new chamber, the first round of representatives would be hand picked by our administration. Though this lower house would hold little true political power, it would likely go a long way at appeasing the locals while also slowly opening the door to wider reforms."
Ostasien.5102.a:0 "We shall make good on our initial promises, but we shall pick the representatives."
Ostasien.5102.b:0 "There is simply no way we will allow these savages self-governance!"

Ostasien.5103.t:0 "The Call for Open Elections"
Ostasien.5103.d:0 "With our agreement to allow the creation of a new lower house populated by loyal locals, the native peoples of our colony have immediately begun calling for true and open public elections so that they may choose their new representatives for themselves. A dangerous prospect indeed, allowing these elections could open our government up to subversive elements, but would widely appease most disgruntled local elements within the colony. If we simply banned radicals like the Socialists who fueled the Indochinese seperatist cells, then we could likely watchdog the elections well enough to prevent radicalism from flooding the new lower house. What shall we do?"
Ostasien.5103.a:0 "To preserve stability, we shall allow non-radicals to run in local elections."
Ostasien.5103.b:0 "They are not fit to make these decisions themselves! Deny their request!"

Ostasien.5104.t:0 "The First Colonial Elections of the German East Asian Parliament"
Ostasien.5104.d:0 "With our decision to allow free local elections, the process to organize such a momentous occasion immediately began, for the locals sought to waste time on the road to secure their futures under colonial rule. Though these 'elections' will merely only decide who makes up the civilian government within the colonial parliament, and shall still have little to no actual power, it will go a long way in appeasing the masses. The groups in the running are not even full organized parties, but more loose coalitions of similarly-minded citizens of the colony that each serve their own benefactors and interests. The Sultans League stands as the bulwark of conservatism, tradition, and monarchism, with much of their prominent figures being within the varied noble houses and families that fill this archipelago. Opposing them are various groups of Entente-aligned remnants leftover from France and Britain’s time lording over these lands, special-interest groups of various elites and business leaders, and finally a small but growing pro-Workers group led by German colonial factory and dock workers. With these groups all in the running, the seats of the lower house are filling fast, but only one can have a clear majority so that the lower house may have a wider shared direction. With the final votes being tallied, it is only a matter of time now before German East Asia’s new civilian government is announced."
Ostasien.5104.a:0 "The Sultans League use their monarchical ties to win the day."
Ostasien.5104.b:0 "The rich, German and Japanese-backed elite take the most seats."

Ostasien.510.t:0 "A Noble New Administration"
Ostasien.510.d.a:0 "With Albert Ballin’s sudden death, the noble Prince Josias of Waldeck und Pyrmont took command of the East Asian Garrison, and in the wake of the Indochinese Revolt, he commanded the Deutsch-Ostasien garrison valiantly. Though Josias attempted to reason with the local native nobles and monarchs, it was too little, too late, and the Indochinese Revolt consumed our colony regardless of the Prince’s attempts at diplomacy. Despite these setbacks, Prince Josias rallied the German Garrison, and after a string of hard fought victories all across the archipelago and within the jungles of Indochina, our forces have finally beaten back the radical insurgents that sought to topple the colonial order. Now, Prince Josias rules over a war-torn but surviving colonial holding supported by the battered but still magnificent fleet that defends this paradise, and it is up to him to pick up the pieces and rebuild the surviving colonial order so that it can return to its former glory."
Ostasien.510.d.b:0 "With Albert Ballin’s sudden death, the noble Prince Josias of Waldeck und Pyrmont took command of the East Asian Garrison, and in the wake of the Indochinese Revolt, he commanded the Deutsch-Ostasien garrison with mixed results. Though Josias attempted to reason with the local native nobles and monarchs, it was too little, too late, and the Indochinese Revolt consumed our colony regardless of the Prince’s attempts at diplomacy. After suffering crushing defeats all across the archipelago and within the jungles of Indochina, our forces have been thoroughly beaten. Now, Prince Josias rules over a neutered colonial holding supported by a shadow of the once magnificent fleet that defended this paradise. It is now up to this Prince to pick up the pieces and rebuild what little he can of the shattered German hegemony that once was dominant over these wilds."
Ostasien.510.d.c:0 "With Albert Ballin’s sudden death, the noble Prince Josias of Waldeck und Pyrmont took command of the East Asian Garrison, and after shrewd diplomacy and long, drawn-out negotiations and compromises, the local tide of radicalism that sought to overturn the long-standing colonial order has been silenced. Prince Josias now lords over a stable, relatively peaceful German East Asia, supported both by his new allies in the local nobility and the reinvigorated colonial administration. With this newfound power and influence, Prince Josias shall endeavor to transform this chaotic imperialist hold into a model colony for the Kaiserreich."
Ostasien.510.a:0 "We have marched through hell and come out the other side stronger than ever!"

Ostasien.511.t:0 "A Strange New Administration"
Ostasien.511.d:0 "Since the death of Ballin and the rise of Indochinese separatism, the honored general August Wilhelm Heye has ruled the colony as an emergency leader along with a clique of loyalists and his own son Hellmuth Heye who has become a notable admiral in his own right, guiding the nation as it dances on the wire above the raging inferno of Indochinese radicalism. A stalwart and intelligent military officer, Heye commanded the German Garrison valiantly during the horrors of the Indochinese revolt, but not with the fires of that war now finally put out, many have called for this war-time government to fulfill its temporary obligation and step down. Long a loyal servant to the Kaiser and never desiring power for himself, William Heye is likely to oblige these calls for his resignation and return to Germany to be with his family and to continue to act as a military instructor. His most likely replacement replacement is the honorable, if a bit eccentric, Felix Nikolaus Alexander Georg Graf von Luckner. Nicknamed ‘De Seeteufel’ or the Sea Devil, von Luckner is one of the most renowned and infamous admirals in the Kaiserreich, equally famous for his loyal service to the Kaiserreich as he is infamous for his moonlighting hobby, for von Luckner is a true and blue modern pirate. Becoming famous for raiding Entente sealines during the Weltkrieg, von Luckner and his ‘Die Piraten des Kaisers’ are expected to be loyal, if rowdy and unorthodox, new commanders of German East Asia, but whispers about von Luckner’s growing eccentricities and ambitions have caused some to be concerned."

Ostasien.511.b:0 "The Sea Devil and his pirates make their move to control the entire government!"

Ostasien.5112.t:0 "The New Grand Admiral"
Ostasien.5112.d:0 "Sailing the seas since he was a boy and rising to be one of the Kaiser’s greatest naval commanders, Felix Nikolaus Alexander Georg Graf von Luckner is one of the most renowned sailors to ever set sail. Born in Dresden in 1881 into the Luckner family - a line of nobles famed for their military prowess - the young Felix was suffocated by his father, who constantly pushed the young boy to join the cavalry corp despite dreaming of a sailor’s life since he was a boy. Unable to take this pressure, Luckner ran away from home at the age of 13, swearing to his family that he would not return until he was wearing ‘the Emperor’s naval uniform, and with honour.’ Taking a fake name, this ‘Phylax Lüdecke’ was able to get an unpaid cabin boy job on an old Russian sailing ship bound for Australia. \n\nDespite nearly dying after falling overboard on the voyage - only to be saved by wrangling an albatross to use as a signal to flag down his shipmates - the young von Luckner took to sea life quickly. \n\nAfter arriving in Australia, the boy took numerous odd jobs to survive which would take him around the world, including being a construction worker, a barman, a tavern keeper, a boxer, a kangaroo hunter, a circus performer, a fisherman, a lighthouse keeper, a guard for the Mexican president, and even serving jail time in a Chilean prison for stealing some pigs, all before reaching the age of 20. Upon his release from jail, he made his way back to Germany, where he entered the nautical navigation school to learn to be a true sailor. From there, he would work on a steamer-line that ran trips between German holdings in Central America and Hamburg before finally returning to his family, who had thought him long dead, and being called into the Kaiser’s naval service in 1912, just two years before the Weltkrieg. \n\nIt was in this war that von Luckner would earn his fame, serving first on the SMS Panther where he would earn a name for himself as a stalwart and brilliant naval officer. Trouncing the British navy at every meeting, the Anglos began to fear von Luckner, earning him his famed moniker ‘Der Seeteufel’, or the Sea Devil. After numerous victories, the Kaiser gifted von Luckner with an impounded three-masted sailing ship, which was rebranded as the Seeadler, or Sea Eagle, and given to von Luckner to command - mainly because he was one of the only officers in the German navy with considerable experience commanding such a large sailing ship. Outfitted with modern cannons, the Sea Devil and his ‘Piraten des Kaisers’ continued to carve a name for themselves as they revived naval mercantile raiding and used it to great effect to tie up the supply lines of the Entente powers. \n\nFollowing the war, von Luckner and his crew continued to serve the Kaiser, raiding enemy shipping lanes and sinking rogue vessels all across the Seven Seas, earning new honors and higher positions along the way until he finally landed him in German East Asia under the command of Hellmuth von Mücke and Wilhelm Solf. Now, with their failures causing much of German East Asia to fall into flames, von Luckner the Sea Devil has inherited their command, and under his steely watch, German East Asia shall be tamed for the Kaiser once more, assuming this old pirate doesn’t simply take matters into his own hands..."

A brilliant strategist, a sound commander, a highly-decorated war hero and veteran, one would expect von Luckner to bear the hard, cold, steely exterior of a standard Old Guard military man, but yet this Privateer of the Kaiserreich has a soft spot. \n\nAccompanying von Luckner virtually all the time are Max and Moritz, his two beloved dachshunds, or German weiner dogs. Bringing them along with him on every official meeting, visit, drill, and even into the heart of war dancing above a watery grave as von Luckner the Seeteufel commands and controls the high seas for the Kaiser from the helm of his signature warship the SMS Seeadler. Known to take them for walks whenever he can, even around the deck of his own ship, von Luckner’s two hounds are more precious to him than any and every medal he has ever earned. Valuing Max and Moritz more than his own life, and possibly even the lives of the men under his command, these two adorable pups help von Luckner soften his edge and relax in occasional breaks from the hum-drum of colonial life."

In his place as colonial governor, Berlin wishes to place Heye’s own son - the esteemed admiral Hellmuth Guido Alexander Heye - in the position, citing his skill as an admiral particularly well-versed in naval commando, submarine, and cruiser tactics, his ties to the Zentrum party back in Berlin, and his absolute loyalty to the Kaiserreich as all the proof and merits needed to be fit for the position. However, the elder Heye has bemoaned the idea, stating that he is not done with the Indochinese and instead wishes to stay in the colony until his retirement or death, whichever comes first. Should we go over August Wilhelm Heye’s head in order to send him back to Berlin where he is needed most while allowing his son to rise out from his father’s shadow to lead the colony anew, or should the old war dog be allowed to live out his final years in the tropical bliss of colonial bureaucracy and guerilla warfare as he so wishes?"

However, despite his experience, Heye has failed both the Kaiser and his countrymen, for not only has Heye failed in putting down the Indochinese insurrection, he has also caused the colony to lose nearly half of its total landmass to these Socialist revolutionaries. With his failures burning deeply and causing so much chaos and pain, many within the surviving colonial rumpstat that is the new German East Asia have called for Heye to resign immediately and return to Germany, calling him a failure and a traitor to German interests and pride. Seeking retribution and revenge, the remaining Germans call for a more effective, and far more infamous, military man to take charge over this failing colony - Ferdinand Schörner. With his reputation for savage effectiveness and brutal efficiency preceding him, Schörner has risen to become the main candidate floated by the current regime to replace Heye, though Heye himself still declares that the war is far from lost and that, with only a little more time, he would show his allies that the fight for German East Asia is far from over. Others have declared that the solution is not to seek revenge, but rather to turn inward and focus on our own issues. These peacemongers have put forward Generaloberst Heye's own son, Hellmuth, a more moderate voice of reason within his father's own cabinet who would most likely accept our losses and move on.\n\n Wilhelm Heye, while having a badly damaged reputation, is still a talented officer who would undoubtedly help the Empire prepare for the war against the Communards, and would likely be of more use back in Germany than in East Asia, which many have written off as a lost cause.\n\n With our Generals Staff debating and arguing over who should lead us in this time of crisis, it is only a matter of time before the dust settles and a new direction for our colony is chosen."

#Ostasien.207.t:0 "Ostasien and The A.O.G."
#Ostasien.207.d:0 "As the primary centre of German influence in Asia, the work of the Ostasien administration often crosses paths with that of the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatische Generalverwaltung, or AOG. While we retain direct control of Guangzhou and Tsingtau, through the AOG, an administrative body operating inside the League of Eight Provinces, we are able to indirectly profit from several key coastal concession cities, alongside various German-owned infrastructure and industries further inland. The AOG does not answer to Ostasien, nor we to them; nevertheless it is in both of our direct interests to support and protect each other where we are able."

The completion and purchase of the Zhegan railway, a large-scale rail project inside the League of Eight Provinces, has allowed the AOG to spread its influence deeper into Chinese territory. While some responses to the AOG's actions have been less than pleasant, we can safely assume that this is a sign of good things to come."

Ostasien.214.d:0 "The sweltering jungles of the Indochinese peninsula contained some of the densest, harshest terrain on Earth; it's dark forests and treacherous caverns swallowing many a poor soul whole as they become lost in its dark maw. This hell on Earth deters all but the most courageous, or crazy, of men and it is here that Ferdinand Schörner has taken up a post. With the fires of syndicalist revolution fast spreading across the region, Schörner has taken to putting down these leftist rebels in a cold and efficient manner. Showing no remorse, his military genius is second only to his brutality as he butchers his way across the south of asia. Under his command, the German East Asian military has bombed these leftist dogs back to the stone age as Schörner shows no mercy or quarter, and at his order, his soldiers have gunned down, burned alive, or even exploded the foul Red’s in their crusade to save the colony and maintain German hegemony in the region. In his eyes, he is simply cleansing the Kaiser’s rightful land of the putrid taint of Syndicalism, and he will perform this needed exorcism of Marxist filth without remorse. As long as Schörner is in Indochina, the Kaiser’s light will continue to gleam over this backwater, and under his command, the forces of German East Asia will be triumphant!"

Ostasien.215.d:0 "The Kaiserreich’s research and development teams are always hard at work trying to invent new ways for our armed forces to get a leg up on our various enemies. Creating an endless supply of good ideas though can be hard, and not all designs pan out. Though many of their more harebrained schemes fall short of being produced, it would seem that this time, more strange ideas won out. \n\nCalled the Ball Tank, or ‘Kugelpanzer’, this one-man armored vehicle built by Krupp is truly one of a kind. Featuring a large, spherical cockpit sided by two circular tracks slanted inwards and with a small balancing wheel attached to a small tripod-like leg in the rear, the Kugelpanzer is unlike any other armored vehicle ever seen before. With only a small vision slit in the front for the driver and with no armament aside from the weapons the pilot had brought with him, these Ball Tanks likely should not have ever been put into production. Regardless of logic or sanity, a set of 24 were made and have been shipped to Germany’s East Asian colonies to be divided amongst our military forces. With steel-plate armor only 5mm thick and with a light, single-cylinder two-stroke motorcycle engine powering each one, these Kugelpanzers will likely only be useful for recon missions. No matter how strange or useless they may seem, we are in no position to be picky, so let us hope these things prove to be useful for something."

Ostasien.300.t:0 "Death of Albert Ballin"
Ostasien.300.d:0 "Sorrow and depression take a toll on one's body, and Albert Ballin is not exempt from such sad realities. An influential shipping magnate and naval innovator turned colonial governor, Ballin has been riding high his whole life, or at least he was until recently. With the economic crisis of the Great Depression and now Black Monday, Ballin’s company and fortune has been plunged into the red as far more dangerous Reds work to undermine all he has built here in East Asia. With his advanced age and the stress of these financial burdens, Ballin’s health, both mental and physical, began to rapidly decline. However, the last straw seems to have been the death of his old business companion and life-long friend Wilhelm Solf, the late Staathalter of Mittelafrika. With the death of this treasured ally, the aging Ballin fell into a spell of deep sadness, and after weeks locked away in his quarters surviving on alcohol, drugs, and scraps of stale bread, it has been announced that Governor Ballin has passed away. Though announced the public that he merely had a heart attack and died peacefully in his sleep, the local administration and those closest to Ballin know the truth - Ballin committed suicide by overdosing on pain killers, opium, and German spirits, choosing to slip into the next life full of elevated bliss, leaving his shattered life behind him. Though this reality has been quickly covered up to prevent the German Garrison from looking vulnerable as the Indochinese separatists circle our regime looking for any signs of weakness, Ballin’s family and friends back in Germany were notified of the tragedy. Now, with Ballin laid to rest, the honored admiral Hellmuth von Mücke has been sworn in as acting Governor until Berlin announces his official replacement."

Petitioning Berlin will take time however, and so we must wait for their reply. It is widely believed that there are three main candidates that the Kaiser and his aides have in mind for the position. The first is the most obvious, and that would be to keep von Mücke on as full and permanent Governor - a no brainer to most given von Mücke’s storied naval career and dutiful service. However, two other names have been floated, being the notorious aristocrat Prince Josias of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and the honored general August Wilhelm Heye. Both of these men would also likely be great leaders for the colony, each having long careers in service to the Kaiserreich and ample military experience.

Ostasien.304.d:0 "Sitting along the Đo’ng Nai River, just a few dozen miles South of the City of An Loc, a quaint fishing village existed in an state of traditional paradise - a peaceful oasis adrift in an evermore chaotic Indochina. This idyll could have possibly lasted for decades longer as the local Vietnamese peasants worked their paddies and fishing nets diligently and without wider worry, as if they were the subjects of some pastoral masterpiece, but this was not to be their fate. \n\nUnbeknowst to most of the village locals, a small Syndicalist cell had begun using one of the village’s fishing operations as a front for their radical activities. Renting fishing rafts and other vessels from some of the more open-minded fishermen, this group of mostly young, College educated, deluded rebels would send stolen German guns up the river to larger guerilla groups hiding in the mountains further North. Though these naive youths thought they were aiding in some noble cause, little did they know that their schemes have now sealed this village’s fate. \n\nRoaring up the Đo’ng Nai on river patrol boats armed to the teeth, Ferdinand Schörner and his loyal death squad of crack veterans readied their flamethrowers, incendiary grenades, MP-40s, and IMCO lighters, for they came to this backwater to do one job - turn this hive of Socialism to ash. As their speeding watercraft made it to the outskirts of the village’s harbor, Schörner’s men began to fire at the fisherman out on their boats, turning the inlet crimson with blood before the German boats even made landfall. Leaping to action immediately, the German death squad moved through the town like a plague, emptying magazine after magazine into each thatch hut before putting them to the torch, burning the dead and wounded inside as a raging inferno consumed the town while blood-curdling screams and the smell of burning flesh and napalm filled the air. \n\nAfter less than an hour, the entire village was either blazing away or already ash, and not a single villager - innocent or Socialist - was left alive. Sure, many tried to flee, but all were gunned down or brought to the torch. So effective and thorough were Schörner and his men that even the secret passageways beneath the village were cleansed and the sole escaping Socialist vessel was incinerated before it could get away. Not a trace of what once existed here now stood, and this fate would be the fate of any other village harboring Indochinese separatists, for this is Schörner’s East Asia now, and he is quite intent on keeping it that way."

#Fleet Exercise
#With the arrival of new capital ships, our fleet has experimented and exercised new group tactics. Maybe it's time to have a joint exercise with the High Sea Fleet?
#Fleet Exercise
#Admiral Hellmuth wanted to hold a fleet exercise between the High Sea Fleet and the East Asian fleet. The East Asian fleet is known for their tactic innovation. This might be a good chance to examine our fleet tactics.
#Kaiserliche Marine has decided to launch a large-scale naval exercise in Indian Ocean. The scenario is be a war for the control of Indian Ocean between the Black fleet in a defensive stance and a superior Yellow fleet aimed to destroy the Black fleet and seize the control of the Andaman Islands. The powerful Yellow Fleet, commanded by admiral Wilhelm Marschall, is comprised of some most modern battleships in the High Sea Fleet. The Yellow Fleet will conduct their operation from Trincomalee naval base. Now it's time to decide our fleet composition and plan.
#Deploy our battleships for a face-to-face combat!
#Deploy battlecruisers for strategic deterrance!
#Deploy carrier groups for long-range operation!

#The Yellow Fleet tried to seize the Andaman Islands
#The exercise has started. The intelligence and air reconaissance suggests that the Yellow fleet is actively preparing the invasion of the Andaman islands. It's estimated that the Yellow will try to secure the Bay of Bengal with concentrated fleet, and then launched the invasion. Should we take a defensive stance to intercept Admiral Marschall's fleet in the area close to the Andaman islands, or try to take the initiative to disturb enemy operation by aggressive actions?
#Intercept them
#Take the initiative!

#Result: Black fleet tactic defeat - battlecruisers
#The Black fleet located the invading Yellow fleet by air reconaissance. Our battlecruisers soon encountered the Yellow scout cruisers. Although the Yellow fleet was slaughtered by Black battlecruisers in the initial encounter, Yellow battleships managed to arrived in time and overwhelmed the Black fleet with massive firepower. One Black battlecruiser suffered critical hits in their engine room and failed to escape but the rest returned to [GetNameGEASingapore]. Having suffered heavy loss of cruisers, the Yellow fleet doesn't have enough screen ships to support the amphibious assault either. The battle was considered a tactic defeat of the Black fleet but the result was strategic stalemate.

#Result: Black fleet tactic victory - battleships
#The Black fleet located the invading Yellow fleet by air reconaissance. The Black scout line spread out in front of the main battle force soon encountered the Yellow scout cruisers. The Black battelships were placed in execellent position to deal serious blows to the Yellow cruisers. Admiral Marschall's main force came into action before the cruisers were annihilated. Over the next hours both fleets exchanged long-range gunfire. The new rangefinders on SMS Neckar allowed it to deliver precious hits even when firing at extreme range. Admiral Hellmuth broke the engagement before the Yellow fleet could shorten the range and fully exploit its numerous advantage. managed to withdraw, it had suffered heavy loss and lost the ability to defend the Andaman islands, and the Yellow fleet eventually was able to launch an amphibious operation. Although the battle was indecisive, the Yellow fleet doesn't have enough screen ships to support the amphibious assault and the exercise ended up with Black fleet's strategic victory.

#Result: Black fleet strategic defeat - battleships
#Black's advance was quickly located by the Yellow's picket line of submarines, depriving them of any advantage of surprise. Soon, the Black fleet encountered the Admiral Marschall's cruiser group west of the Andaman islands. The Yellow cruisers turning to the north-west on a course to rejoin the battleships. The Black fleet pursued the cruisers until the Yellow battelships moved into position. Over the next hours both fleets exchanged long-range gunfire and the Black fleet was outgunned by the superior Yellow fleet. When Admral Hellmuth's fleet managed to withdraw, it had suffered heavy loss and lost the ability to defend the Andaman islands, and the Yellow fleet eventually was able to launch an amphibious operation. The exercise ended up with Black fleet's strategic defeat.


#Result: Black fleet strategic victory - battlecruisers
#Admiral Hellmuth decided to disperse his cruisers to harass the Yellow fleet and use battlecruiser to support them. These commerce destroyers posed great threats to the Yellow convoys. The Yellow fleet attempted to fend off the raiders by search and destroy actions but the Black cruisers avoid the engagement. Finally Admiral Marschall decided to disperse his fleet to protect the convoys. In an engagement, the convoys escorted by a Yellow battleship was assaulted by a Black raiding fleet supported by three battlecruisers. The convoys were savaged before the reinforcement arrived. The Yellow fleet was deterred from further actions. The result was judged a strategic victory of Admiral Hellmuth's Black fleet.

#Result: Black fleet decisive victory - carriers
#Admiral Hellmuth decided to take an audacious action: The black fleet comprised four aircraft carriers plus supporting ships under the command of the Admiral moved to about 200 miles south of Sri Lanka. The first attack wave of 93 aircraft took off in pre-dawn darkness heading towards Trincomalee. The air strike achieved complete surprise. The Yellow battle fleet and convoys are at anchor in the harbour of Trincomalee and failed to organise any resistance. Aerial torpedo experts in all modern navies had previously thought that torpedo attacks against ships can not take place in shallow waters, but the Ostasien fleet had developed a new method of preventing torpedoes from diving too deep. The air strike delivered a devastating blow to the Yellow fleet with suprisingly little loss of planes. The exercise ended up with Black decisive victory.

#Result: Black fleet decisive victory - carriers
#The Black carriers and screen ships formed a concentrated battle group sailing towards the west. The scout bombers managed to locate the Yellow convoys by the morning. A massive attack wave was launched but the pilot missed the position of the convoys. Instead, they discovered the location of the Yellow main forces. The Ostasien torpedo bombers launched their strike with deadly precision. As a result of two waves of aerial attacks, at least three Yellow battelships and two cruisers were judged to have suffered damage, among which one cruiser considered to be hit by three torpedoes was judged sunk. The loss of Black aircrafts was negeligible. The exercise ended up with Black decisive victory.

#Result: Black fleet strategic defeat - carriers
#The Black's advance was quickly located by the Yellow's picket line of submarines. Due to the failure of reconaissance, Black carriers encountered the scout cruisers fleet of the Yellow. Significant damage was laid on carriers during the surface gunfire action, with Hellmuth's carrier eventually judged sunk by torpedo from a Yellow destroyer. The Black fleet had lost the ability to defend the Andaman islands, and the Yellow fleet eventually was able to launch an amphibious operation. The exercise ended up with Black fleet's strategic defeat.

GEA_colonial_nation:0 "Colonial Government"
GEA_colonial_nation_desc:0 "Despite its limited autonomy in dealings with its neighbours, the GEA is effectively a colonial government; its entire state apparatus hinging on and mantained by German power, with a budget prepared in Berlin, and its currency pegged to the German Mark."
GEA_colonial_question:0 "Colonial Question"
GEA_colonial_question_desc:0 "The amount of manpower our land based arm can recruit is severely limited. Strict regulations regarding foreign nationals joining, and a general lack of willingness by the natives, stifles our attempt to build a larger force."
GEA_prussian_force:0 "Prussian Thought"
GEA_prussian_force_desc:0 "It has been decided that the locals are not fit to serve the Grand Admiral or the Kaiser, while this will extensively limit our recruitment it will provide a better quality of soldier."

GEA_admirality_desc:0 "German East Asia is a land dominated by its navy. The grand armada that [GEA.getleader] has under his command is one of the greatest the world has ever seen. Our mighty floating fortresses protect this tropical paradise from insurrection and foreign invaders, guarding the Kaiserreich’s crown jewel of its Asian Sphere. Though prone to separatism and radicalism, these lands are kept secure and solely in German hands by this mighty fleet, and as such, the navy is our utmost priority. Everything our nation can spare goes to this fantastic fleet, for without it we would surely fall into chaos and savagery, and though this naval primacy may hurt other sectors of our nation, it matters not to our band of sea dogs, for it’s a sailor's life for we!"

GEA_Colonial_Nation:0 "Colonial Government"
GEA_Colonial_Nation_desc:0 "Created during the rapid expansion of the 1920s, German East Asia is essentially a branch of Kaiserliche Marine tied with several territories. The admiralty in [GetNameGEASingapore] exists not as a government, or even formally as an authority, but instead as a jurisdiction; a stretch of territory in which the relatively impartial admiralty must at once balance local interests, contend with varying colonial systems, and ensure the protection of it all."

SIC_focus:0 "Two Sicilies Focus Tree"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last twenty years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a member of the Italian Federation and now a sovereign nation. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

POLITICS_PIO_DESC:0 "Padre Pio is many things, a Priest, a Friar, a Soldier, a Leader, a Mystic. Above all else, A servant of the Lord and His Church. Born to a devout peasant family in Southern Italy, Francesco Forgione decided from a young age to devote his life to God. Upon joining the Order of Friars Minor at the age of 15, Forgione took the name Pio. With the entry of Italy into the Weltkrieg, the now ordained Padre Pio was drafted into the Medical Corps. As Italy collapsed, he returned to his community, just in time for syndicalist insurgents to sack his monastery and kill four of his brothers. Shortly after, stigmata wounds appeared on his hands. It was then that Padre Pio learned of God’s plan for him. Joining an anti-syndicalist militia as Chaplain, his resolve quickly took him to the position of Commander. With God guiding his destiny, Pio has become the most powerful man in the NeoSanfedisti. No amount of suffering will stop Padre Pio from reviving the Church to truly embrace Christ’s message of Purity and Unity."

POLITICS_ZIGGI_DESC:0 "Renato Ziggiotti has not always been a priest, he has not always been a solider, but for the past twenty years he has done almost nothing but fight, trying to free the people of Italy from the socialist menace. Born October 9, 1892 in Campodoro, Ziggiotti lived a fairly normal childhood, entering the Salesian Novitiateon on September 15, 1909. However, the Weltkrieg would shatter his attempt to live as a simple religious, as he along with many of his brothers would be enlisted in the Italian army, first seeing combat in June 1915. Ziggiotti would do fairly well in the army, up until he was shot in the arm in 1917, knocking him out of the fight. In his time in recovery, he would study theology, and first feel his call to the priesthood. When he was eventually discharged from hospital he would be sent back to the collapsing Austrian front. Before he could get to the front, Austria was rapidly approaching Rome, leading to the capitulation of Italy. Ziggiotti as with thousands of other soldiers expected this to be the end of the war but in fact it was only the beginning. As a coalition of Republicans, Socialists and Nationalists rose up against the Kingdom, Ziggiotti would find himself leading a group of men against these rebels. After the Republican split in the North and the South becoming relatively stabilized by the monarchist generals stationed there Ziggiotti, now a Captain , and his men were one of the first units sent to mop up any southern socialist stragglers. Ziggiotti fought hard and after the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi issued a call to arms to all faithful Catholics of Italy to form a New Army of Holy Faith, a NeoSanfedisti. This action earned the ire of the militants near the border who staged a darring raid on Naples and kidnapped the Cardinal. Ziggiotti (along a few other units) heard this call and took action, crossing the border, establishing the northern structures of the NeoSanfedisti and rescuing Cardinal Ascalesi. In reward for this, Cardinal Ascalesi would ordain Ziggiotti after hearing of his desire to become a priest. Since that day, Padre Ziggiotti has become the defacto leader of the southern NeoSanfedisti, being the one to propose the idea of the Leadership Council. Now that he has been elected to truly lead them, Ziggiotti will do whatever it takes to create a truly holy Italy."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_ISIS_DESC:0 "The Leadership Council of the NeoSanfedisti is less a formal military high command and more a way to keep the disparaging militias of the Army of Holy Faith from attacking each other. Formed to unite the various militias of the Faithful who rose in response to the instability that has been plaguing Italy, it cannot be said that the Leadership Council has not done it's job. Prior to the Leadership Council's creation, it was not uncommon to see fellow Catholics attacking one another over trivial issues. With the NeoSanfedisti coming on top of the South once and for all, these issues are once again bubbling to surface, and it is likely that the Leadership Council will finally be dissolved once it's hold over the south is consolidated."

Upon becoming the Roman Pontiff, Pio took the name Leo, the fourteenth pontiff of that name, after Saint Leo the Great, the great defender of orthodoxy. Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the Papacy will be taking a hard traditionalist bent in the coming years."

Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the Papacy will be taking a more moderate approach to running the Church, many also expect that His Holiness will focus and encourage missionary activity, to bring the gospel to all nations."

POLITICS_RICCARDO_LOMBARDI_DESC:0 "Born in Regalbuto, Sicily, on August 16th 1901, Riccardo Lombardi's has been nothing if not eventful despite its relative shortness compared to perennial figures in the world of Italian politics. The events of the Civil War abruptly cut his engineering education at the University of Milan, and as a Catholic Lombardi fled the Socialist troops in the more traditional Southern regions of his homeland. There he joined the newly formed Partito Populare Italiano of Don Luigi Sturzo, but after disagreements over their commitment to the working class, peasantry and the influence of the Two Sicilies' nobility on the party Riccardo subsequently left the party. After that he joined a creation of his close associate, Guido Miglioli, that being the Partito Cristiano del Lavoro, a movement decidedly on the left-wing of the Christian political spectrum. With years passing Lombardi grew dissatisfied with the elitist character of the Kingdom, the ever increasing resentment of the established leftist parties, especially Gaetamo Salvemini's Partito Democratico del Lavoro, towards the notion that the South should ever rejoin one state with the North. This culminated in a mass campaign led by the charismatic politician amongst the Mezzogiorno's peasantry in an effort to create a truly mass and pious agrarian workers' movement. Modelled after the old Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori Lombardi hopes to one day change his homeland into a true Republic, one that would then become the start of an ambitious project meant to mend Italy into a more perfect Union."

POLITICS_CALOGERO_VIZZINI_DESC:0 "Few criminals in the world have ever reached such renown status as Calogero Vizzini. His operations in Sicily being enough to topple a standing government and put Southern Italy under the control of a ruthless crime syndicate. Yet, despite Calogero Vizzini infamous status within the Mafia, he carries himself as a gentleman who only resorts to violence when he needs to and respects the people under his care. To some, he is a man if honour, to others he is a ruthless boss. But regardless, his power over the South is large, and the power of the Mafia over his fiefdom is nearly absolute. The South is governed by crime, even if Vizzini can conduct his operations in a somewhat legal matter. "

POLITICS_JULIUS_EVOLA_DESC:0 "Baron Julius Evola is one of the most controversial political philosophers in Europe and, perhaps, the world. Devoting himself to an ideology that has been named "Radical Traditionalism", "Legionarism" and "Ultra-Rightism", Evola believes that modern society is in the age that Hinduism refers to as "Kali Yuga", or an age of darkess and choas. Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."

POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_III_DESC:0 "The Former King of Italy and Head of the main branch of the House of Savoy has returned from his long exile to find an army of fanatical monarchists at his disposal. He is utterly an admirer of Julius Evola, now his High Chancellor, for making the seemingly impossible come true and bringing to life his aspirations. It helps that the King is also known to harbor reactionary beliefs which grow increasingly right-wing with Evola at his side and the Socialist enemy in the north. He hopes that he and Legion can accomplish the seemingly impossible and defeat the traditional enemies to his power, the republicans, the socialists and the Catholic Church."

### Ideas ###
SIC_bourbon_restoration_idea:0 "The Bourbon Restoration"
SIC_bourbon_restoration_idea_desc:0 "The Restoration of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies came not out of diehard loyalty to the concept, but rather from a lack of a better idea. Stranded in the turbulent whirlwind of Italian Republics, Monarchists and Regionalists struck a compromise to restore the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies as a neutral player on the Italian Scene. This compromise, while acceptable to some, has no shortage of opponents, who maintain distrust of both the Monarchy and the concept of an independent Mezzogiorno. The King himself, keenly aware of his status, reigns over a nation hastily pulled from the dustbin of history. While content to serve as a figurehead monarch in place of a Habsburgs or Savoyard, Ferdinando III privately worries about the safety of his throne in a nation which has proven that it can easily live without him. This indifference to the monarchy also plays directly into the ideas of Bourbon Nostalgic and Catholic Nationalists, who still hold the view that a Strong King and a Strong National Identity are the key to stability in the turbulent Italian Peninsula."
SIC_identity_question_idea:0 "Unclear Identity"
SIC_identity_question_idea_desc:0 "The concept of a United Italy is still a somewhat new concept, and while the Expedition of the Thousand may be a celebrated moment to some, others have little nostalgia for a Central Government which often neglected the needs of the Mezzogiorno. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, founded as a hasty compromise due to seeming lack of better options, serves as a monument to the discontent Southern Italy has often felt. Italy, for better or for worse, is a bitterly divided land; and there is no shortage of citizens who feel that Italy is better that way. Others however yearn for the re-unification of Italy, by the hand of the Bourbon Dynasty, the Savoyards in Sardinia, or even the disgraced former King Vittorio Emanuele III. If the Two Sicilies is to avoid annihilation once more, then we must decide definitely the place our nation will take in Italian Affairs, and on the world stage."

This has been incredibly lucrative for the Two Sicilies, and has turned it's maritime industry into one that need not be ashamed in the face of any but the greatest naval hegemons, but with this success comes unforeseen costs. At present, a plurality of the martitime industry is owned by foreigners and largely cater to foreign contracts first, leaving our own naval growth hamstrung and being a point of controversy with nationalist elements who think that an industry so significant to our economy and national defense should not be put in the hands of powers beyond our borders."

SIC_sicilian_auto_industry:0 "Sicilian Automotive Industry"
SIC_sicilian_auto_industry_desc:0 "The key to modern warfare is to move faster than our enemies to outmanoeuvre them. Thankfully, many automotive leaders were pushed off of Syndicalist lands and can lend us a hand in reclaiming occupied territory."

SIC_strike_now_desc:0 "We are at war with the Socialist Republic - now the time has come for Italy to be reclaimed from the godless syndicalists!"
SIC_apenini:0 "Arditi degli Appennini"
SIC_apenini_desc:0 "The mountainous region in the border with the Syndicalist-controlled areas will be a crucial battleground. As will be the Alps, once we are forced to face the French menace. Our elite troops, heirs of the surviving Alpini of the Royal Italian Army, will gallantly serve again."
SIC_fusilero:0 "Sicilian Marine Corps"
SIC_fusilero_desc:0 "Our navy can ensure superiority in the seas; with that advantage, we will strike at the coastlines of the Syndicalists and reclaim Italy for the Italians."
SIC_army_reform:0 "Begin Army Reform"
SIC_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army is still in many ways a mish-mash of militias, old Federal Italian divisions, conscripts and foreign volunteers. Organising it into an effective fighting force will be a complicated task."
SIC_army_innovation:0 "Messe's Reform Plan"
SIC_army_innovation_desc:0 "A small clique of generals, led by Giovanni Messe, a veteran of the Italian front and the Italian civil war, is planning audacious reforms to our military structure and planning. Perhaps allowing them to have their voice heard is in our best interest."
SIC_he_protecc:0 "Defensive Stance"
SIC_he_protecc_desc:0 "We are hopelessly outnumbered by the Third Internationale. The best course of action is to defend our perimeter defences until the time is right to strike down the Syndicalists in a devastating counteroffensive."
SIC_artillery_batteries:0 "Artillery Batteries"
SIC_artillery_batteries_desc:0 "The Abruzzo line must be held if our plans are to succeed. We must ensure that our artillery has the firepower needed to properly beat back any offensive pushes from the Syndicalists."

SIC_further_fortifications:0 "Further the Abruzzo Line"
SIC_further_fortifications_desc:0 "The Syndicalists believe they can smash through our forces easily with French backup. How wrong they are! The Abruzzo line is one of the most heavily fortified areas in all of Europe, and we will not relinquish an inch of it that easily!"
SIC_coastal_batteries:0 "Coastal Batteries"
SIC_coastal_batteries_desc:0 "The perfidious Syndicalists will no doubt be frustrated by our effective resistance and will attempt many naval landings against us to seize key ports and supply lines of our kingdom. We will have especially large and modern guns as a special welcome gift, as planned."

### Industry Focuses ###
SIC_development:0 "The Future of the Mezzogiorno"
SIC_development_desc:0 "Our status of being the wealthiest of Italian nations is not due to our actual wealth, but to how the other parts of the peninsula's assets are either war-torn or owned by foreign investors. We are effectively the last hope of Italian industry."
SIC_agrarian_issue:0 "The Agrarian Question"
SIC_agrarian_issue_desc:0 "Ever since the invasion of the Lombards, our lands have been dominated by large-scale landholders. Very few men own almost all the land, and the conditions for those working the land is almost feudal. With the election passed, the time has come to finally address the issue."
SIC_invest_modern_farming:0 "Modernize Farming Methods"
SIC_invest_modern_farming_desc:0 "No more can the ploughshare and wheelbarrow truly be deemed the tools of the farmers; tractors and other machines of the modern age are slowly but surely taking their place."
SIC_buy_back_land:0 "Buy Back the Land"
SIC_buy_back_land_desc:0 "It will be costly, but we will sit down with the landowners and discuss a fair price to buy back large tracts of their land - which we can then put to our own, better use."
SIC_through_land_reform:0 "First Steps of Land Reform"
SIC_through_land_reform_desc:0 "With continued use of military force, intense political action and intervention by concerned community leaders, we will start breaking up the private land areas - no matter what the current owners have to say about it."
SIC_through_land_reform2:0 "Completing Land Reform"
SIC_through_land_reform2_desc:0 "It may take the use of force, even evicting some landowners from their estates, but in the end the country will benefit greatly."
SIC_future_of_farming:0 "The Future of Farming"
SIC_future_of_farming_desc:0 "It has taken time, but the changes we've made to land use in the countryside have taken hold and already we're seeing an increase in efficiency and the growth of urban areas. The path we took was difficult, but we got there."
SIC_investment:0 "Industrial Investments"
SIC_investment_desc:0 "In order to properly modernise our great nation, we will attempt to gather the resources we need by gathering foreign and local capital into our own investment plans."
SIC_industry1:0 "Begin Industrialisation Efforts"
SIC_industry1_desc:0 "Historically an agrarian area, any effort to industrialise the region of the Mezzogiorno will be an expensive and complex endeavour. We, however, are up to the challenge."
SIC_military_industrial:0 "Incentives Arms Industries"
SIC_military_industrial_desc:0 "The arms industry is an important economic sector. By working closely with contractors and offering new contracts, we can encourage the expansion of many armaments facilities."
SIC_military_industrial2:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
SIC_military_industrial2_desc:0 "The economy and the military must not be at odds, they must be like two complimentary gears in a greater machine."
SIC_hvy_industry:0 "Construction Subsidies"
SIC_hvy_industry_desc:0 "We must build faster! More forts, more trenches, more ports, more factories, more bases, more dockyards, more roads: All the needed building blocks of an independent power which we lack."
SIC_hvy_industry2:0 "Heavy Industry Incentives"
SIC_hvy_industry2_desc:0 "By investing into heavy industry, we can ensure that our nation's heavy industry can withstand the pressures of wartime."
SIC_developed_nation:0 "Industrial Development Effort"
SIC_developed_nation_desc:0 "While still an ongoing process, and an expensive one at that, we can ensure that our legacy of industrialisation is one that for centuries will have improved the Kingdom for the better. We will spare no expense."
SIC_industrial_modernization:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
SIC_industrial_modernization_desc:0 "More than additional factories, we need our existing ones to work better, faster and be always modern. We cannot allow the great red shadow to outproduce our military!"
SIC_dig_deeply_and_greedily:0 "Dig Greedily and Deeply"
SIC_dig_deeply_and_greedily_desc:0 "We will delve and search deep, survey new mines and ensure that we have the minerals needed to protect ourselves."
SIC_BM_gonepoof:0 "Ending the Crisis"

SIC_thriving_economy:0 "Thriving Economy"

SIC_BM_deal:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
SIC_BM_deal_desc:0 "Dealing with a recession this catastrophic won't be easy. Albeit time will be an ally in the recovery, we must act if we are to properly see this issue dealt with."
SIC_infro:0 "Infrastructure Investments"
SIC_infro_desc:0 "As a historically rural region, little investment in the Railways and other vital infrastructure works was done in the Mezzogiorno, with the exception of works in the past 10 years. We must redouble our efforts."
SIC_asuterity_measures:0 "Austerity Measures"
SIC_asuterity_measures_desc:0 "Spending wisely is the key to good leadership. Our foes will envy the wealth we gain from little more than doing good common sense budgeting."

### Navy and Air Focuses ###
SIC_theshipyardmatter:0 "The Shipyard Matter"
SIC_theshipyardmatter_desc:0 "Sicily has, for more than a decade, greatly profited from the use of its large drydocks to sell warships to various nations in these troubled times. These profits give the state a meaningful contribution, even if most of our drydocks are working for foreign powers. A change of policy may well be in order in these difficult times of austerity."
SIC_seize_existing:0 "Nationalise Shipyards"
SIC_seize_existing_desc:0 "By forcefully buying up most non state shipyards at distressed prices following Black monday for our own use and cancelling ship orders, we can immensely increase our military naval production capacity with next to no delay, though this will relinquish the profits incurred by many lucrative contracts they would have once fulfilled."
SIC_build_state_ones2:0 "Expand Taranto Shipyards"
SIC_build_state_ones2_desc:0 "Our next state dockyard complex will be in Taranto; in this ancient city the new face of naval warfare will be sculpted."
SIC_merchant_marine:0 "Expand Port Facilities"
SIC_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Rather than getting rid of our foreign naval contracts, we should use their interest in our ports to attract investment and improve the services Sicilian ports can provide - to them as well as to us."
SIC_build_state_ones:0 "Expand Napoli Shipyards"
SIC_build_state_ones_desc:0 "Rather than wasting valuable profits and contracts, we will expand our own capacity to produce ships, starting with the building of state drydocks in our own capital, Napoli."
SIC_naval_moderniazation:0 "Naval Modernisation"
SIC_naval_moderniazation_desc:0 "Our navy, while mighty, suffers from having many outdated models, and worse, outdated admirals. A major reform is in order."
SIC_heavy_buildup:0 "Heavy Buildup"
SIC_heavy_buildup_desc:0 "We need more ships, capable of beating back our foes and ensure they meet a watery grave deep in Neptune's realm. Not small, puny escort ships, but the great towering barrages of flagships will win us the sea."
SIC_bb:0 "New Dreadnoughts"
SIC_bb_desc:0 "Our current dreadnoughts are old; some almost relics that should be kept in Museums in peaceful times. If we don't make new, better dreadnought designs, our navy's performance will simply fall short."
SIC_carry:0 "Carrier Experiments"
SIC_carry_desc:0 "The idea of a Ship Carrier isn't new, but how to make it function properly and how to produce such a gargantuan ship are entirely alien concepts to our shipbuilders, and efforts will be made to remedy that failing."
SIC_shbb:0 "Flagship Designs"
SIC_shbb_desc:0 "The Kingdom needs a new Flagship; a fully armed and operational dreadnought capable of laying waste to a port in a matter of hours. To make this goal a reality, our top experts in many related fields will tirelessly work to ensure peace reigns in the seas, supported by superior firepower."
SIC_smaller_navy:0 "Strategic Navy"
SIC_smaller_navy_desc:0 "Our navy cannot stand up alone in an open battle to the Internationale. Instead, we will use it to protect our coastlines, and focus on the production of smaller ships and commerce raiding to protect our ageing capital ships and damage their economies, respectively."
SIC_cruiser:0 "Cruiser Models"
SIC_cruiser_desc:0 "Renewing our cruisers will ensure that our great ships are properly screened and that we can win the battle for both seas of Italy."
SIC_naval_drilling:0 "Naval Drilling"
SIC_naval_drilling_desc:0 "Practice makes perfect, and ensuring our Sailors knows what to do when the time comes is absolutely fundamental. A system of drills must be implemented to make sure that happens."
SIC_medit_tactics:0 "Mediterranean Tactics"
SIC_medit_tactics_desc:0 "Naval Warfare in the Mediterranean is not a simple affair, nor can it be compared to that of the Open Sea. Control of coastlines and ports, and of the skies, will be fundamental, as our capacity to plan naval campaigns and expeditions."
SIC_subs:0 "Submarine Effort"
SIC_subs_desc:0 "Our quest to naval dominance may well be reliant on more indirect means. Through submersible warfare, we will ensure our capacity to keep a naval presence even in areas which would be conventionally inaccessible by our forces."
SIC_barbones_air_tree:0 "Air Force Reform"
SIC_barbones_air_tree2:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
SIC_barbones_air_tree3:0 "IMAM Subsidies"
SIC_barbones_air_tree_desc:0 "Our air force is too small and untrained, despite the natural disposition of many companies in the region to produce aircraft. Perhaps the time has come to remedy this issue."
SIC_barbones_air_tree2_desc:0 "To truly win the war that approaches, we must ensure that the skies of our great Kingdom are under our control at all times."
SIC_barbones_air_tree3_desc:0 "Our industries must be able to produce the best aeroplanes they can, even if this means we must cut a few corners here and there."

### Foreign Policy Focuses ###
SIC_old_order:0 "The Old Order"
SIC_old_order_desc:0 "It is clear that a centralised Italian state will only once more bring ruin by neglecting those outside of a few urban centres. The future of Italy must instead look once more to the past, and we will ensure that the new confederation will bring prosperity to all of Italy and its many peoples."
SIC_preserve_status_quo:0 "Preserve the Status Quo"
SIC_preserve_status_quo_desc:0 "The Confederation respects regional differences, local customs and cultures and is far more representative than the Savoyard kingdom ever was. However, we must keep vigilant to remind would-be traitors that we are still all Italians, and that our motherland must be defended."
SIC_rebuild_northern_arms_industry:0 "Rebuilding the Northern Arms Industry"
SIC_rebuild_northern_arms_industry_desc:0 "With northern Italy now free of syndicalist oppression much work must be done to fully restore the region to its former glory. To help our fellow confederation members achieve this goal, we should strive to restore the once great arms industry to its former glory."
SIC_coordinated_commercial_development:0 "Coordinated Commercial Development"
SIC_coordinated_commercial_development_desc:0 "The years of syndicalist rule have not been kind to northern business, but with the weight of socialism having now been lifted from them it is time for Italian commerce to once again spread throughout both the peninsula and one day the world."
SIC_customs_union:0 "Confederate Customs Union"
SIC_customs_union_desc:0 "We must freely allow merchandise, goods, companies and people to move through the territories of the Confederation, to ease rebuilding and ensure that the smaller states don't lack vital resources."
SIC_organise_conferate_army:0 "Organise a Joint Confederate Army"
SIC_organise_conferate_army_desc:0 "While all states of the confederation are expected to maintain their own personal armies, it is clear that not all of these armies will be equal. To solve this we must ensure that proper command structures are developed to allow all of the armies of the confederation to act in unison, fighting as one cohesive unit taking advantage of each army's unique strengths while also tackling their weaknesses."
SIC_combined_theory_development:0 "Combined Theory Development"
SIC_combined_theory_development_desc:0 "Italy is a fantastically diverse region where each of its peoples have their own unique experiences, and when developing the combat theories of our armed forces we should not neglect the knowledge this can impart upon us. Through cooperation and knowledge sharing within the confederation, we will be able to develop much more efficiently and effectively."
SIC_constituent_training_schemes:0 "Constituent Training Schemes"
SIC_constituent_training_schemes_desc:0 "With the Sicilian army being the largest and strongest of those within the confederation, it is no surprise that many from the constituent states wish to join it directly. We should encourage these new recruits and ensure that they are trained as well as the rest of our army."
SIC_frattelli_ditalia:0 "Fratelli d'Italia"
SIC_frattelli_ditalia_desc:0 "It is clear that disorganised confederations do nothing but hold a nation back. Like the Prussians did over sixty years ago now, Italy has been reorganised into a great empire! Lead by a government that holds Italy's true interests at heart, we will surely prosper for a thousand years."
SIC_imppero_italiano:0 "First Italian Empire"
SIC_imppero_italiano_desc:0 "An empire must have an emperor, regardless of our great King's humble reluctance to claim the title. Having restored the nation from the brink of ruin, stamping out the threat of syndicalism, and rejecting the dominion of foreign powers who wish to see Italy remain divided and weak, it is finally time for him to receive the crown he deserves."
SIC_restore_royal_titles:0 "Restore Royal Titles"
SIC_restore_royal_titles_desc:0 "When the north was seized by socialism, many of the northern nobility were forced into exile across the world. Now that the land has been reclaimed these nobles should have their titles restored and be allowed to help manage their former holdings, as is their birthright."
SIC_direct_centralised_rule:0 "Direct Centralised Rule"
SIC_direct_centralised_rule_desc:0 "The feudalistic approach is an undated relic of a bygone age, one which will simply hold Italy back from the greatness it deserves. It is clear that Italy must remain a highly centralised state, and eliminate all pointless provincial and noble bureaucracy that will simply get in the way of efficient rule."

SIC_rebuilding_the_north_desc:0 "While many of the northern nobles may have been restored to their positions, much of the north still remains scarred by the remnants of syndicalist occupation.

SIC_rewarding_the_south_desc:0 "Southern Italy has long been seen as the neglected backwater of the peninsula, one that those in the north often wish to ignore the existence of.

SIC_roma_caput_mundi_desc:0 "Naples served the nation as a fine capital when the need to do so was thrust upon it, but with Italy now reunited again it is time for the \"Eternal City\" to return to its rightful place as the centre of a great Italian empire, and so the infrastructure needed to support such an important capital must be developed post haste."

SIC_paolis_legacy_desc:0 "While he never succeeded in his dreams of freeing Corsica from French rule, Pasquale Paoli has become an inspiration to many Coriscans and especially those who recognise the island's intrinsic relation with Italy.

SIC_knights_of_the_grail:0 "Knights of the Grail"
SIC_knights_of_the_grail_desc:0 "In order to carry out our goals we will need more than loosely organized militias. The Knights of the Grail, named for adventures whom went on that ancient journey, is a highly-esteemed society made up of our most loyal militants armed with our best equipment so that they may answer directly to the Soveriegn without question and cast his enemies into darkness forever."
SIC_aristocratic_funding:0 "Aristocratic Funding"
SIC_aristocratic_funding_desc:0 "While our cause was already supported by a handful of aristocratic exiles our victory should remove doubt as to our ability to come to power.

SIC_confiscate_wealth_desc:0 "There is still property and riches belonging to loyalists of the old order, foreigners and gangsters that exist only to enrich these modernizing degenerates while pushing society further into chaos.

SIC_destroy_liberalism:0 "Destroy Liberalism"
SIC_destroy_liberalism_desc:0 "At long last we can do away with that system which has made man decadent, weak and pampered.

SIC_a_proper_king:0 "A Real King"
SIC_a_proper_king_desc:0 "It's finally time to finally replace the liberal, foreign Bourbon rule whose very existence was a mockery to our traditions with our traditional nobles.

SIC_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
SIC_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
SIC_hit_papacy:0 "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SIC_hit_papacy_desc:0 "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership.

SIC_ghibelline_revival:0 "Ghibelline Revival"
SIC_ghibelline_revival_desc:0 "Against the Mercantilist Guelphs the Ghibelline understood that spiritual power should rest with the Emperor alone.

SIC_legionary_order:0 "Legionary Order"
SIC_legionary_order_desc:0 "It is time to establish an official political class based on the values that should that be rewarded; vitality, traditionalism, strength and loyalty.

SIC_heroic_idealism:0 "Heroic Idealism"
SIC_heroic_idealism_desc:0 "It is through heroic experiences that we not only create men but super-men whom display the best of their nation and find themselves in war, until the act becomes holy itself.

SIC_magical_societies:0 "Occult Societies"
SIC_magical_societies_desc:0 "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism.

SIC_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"
SIC_constrained_science_desc:0 "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration.

SIC_spiritual_casteism:0 "Spiritual Casteism"
SIC_spiritual_casteism_desc:0 "At long last the King and our Warrior-Nobility have established total dominance.

In order to alleviate this issue, Capo dei Capi Calogero Vizzini has moved to organize a shared power structure and hierarchy across all families and cosca, or Sicilian clans named after the tightly-bound leaves of our island’s native artichokes and thistles, in order to streamline our growing apparatus of state across all regions while maintaining our Mafiusu roots. Each family and clan - each ruling over their own town, city, neighborhood, villa, borgata, village, or other community as they always have - shall stand on a foundation of associates and contract men that aid the organization at arms length, able to be thrown under the bus at a moment’s notice if need be. Above them are our soldiers - our made men, our wise guys, our true Mafiosos, or Mafiusu as we Sicilians call them, all sworn to the Omertà for life as true members of the family, no matter how small - that form the lowest ranks of true members of Cosa Nostra. Ruling each group of soldiers are our captains and skippers, the capodecina - or the caporegime as our American offshoots prefer to call them. Usually shortened to the capos, these ranking mafiusu act as sergeants and officers, running their squads autonomously as they see fit and acting as the middlemen between the lower rank and file, and their leaders in the upper echelons of the organization. Each capo reports directly to the underboss, chosen to be the right-hand man of each family’s true Boss or Don, who is also aided by his hand-selected consiglieres who may or may not be in the family based on personal preference. This organized and standardized hierarchy shared across all groupings under the Don of Dons shall ensure that even in our decentralized system, there shall be no more solo enterprises, for the Cosa Nostra now and forever acts as one."

Leaning on this legacy of banditry and violent intimidation, we shall press our remaining political enemies and those foolish enough to still hold out against us while reviving the vast network of highwaymen and brigands that once dominated the South of our beautiful peninsula once more, only this time these positions shall be staffed by our own associates and made men, ensuring only Cosa Nostra and the Mafiusu state of Don of Dons Vizzini benefits in the end."

So prevalent is this phenomenon in our new state, the act of being ‘disappeared’ by the Mafia has become a commonplace fear among the masses, even being told as bedtime stories to scare kids into behaving, but it is far more than a child’s tale.

Despite these condemnations, the practice has yet to be formally condemned by a Council. Several of the Council Fathers seek to change this. A proposed decree that has been presented to the Council Fathers would see Freemasonry outlined and explained why it is seen as heretical, and why a Catholic cannot under any circumstances stance join such an origination.

Along with this return to 'missionary mode' comes permission to say Holy Mass in the local language of the Faithful.

### Events ###

sic.1.t:0 "The Legacy of the Civil War"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which lasted until 1860 when Sardinia-Piedmont, aided by Garibaldi's partisans, united Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoyards, who did not care much for industrialising the south, and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Italy eventually chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians signed an armistice in 1919, in which they were allowed to occupy Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. However, outraged nationalists, republicans and socialists rose up against the government for their foolhardy actions in starting a war they were doomed to lose, and when King Victor Emanuel and his son abdicated, the Kingdom of Italy collapsed into anarchy. Civil war soon convulsed the peninsula, and hope seemed lost for the White forces in the south of Italy until the Austrians rejoined the war, in exchange for southern participation in a new political system - the Italian Federation. The Austrians pushed back the syndicalists from Lombardy, and the syndicalist pressure on the Abruzzo line was removed. Following the ceasefire, the south joined the Italian Federation as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but it was always with the understanding that only the promise of Austrian aid kept the Federation intacy. When the syndicalists threatened the south in 1927, Austria's promises of protection vanished... and while the war never materialized, the worth of the Federation was revealed. The Two Sicilies, the Papal State and Sardinia withdrew, leaving Austria's only place of influence the republic in the north."
sic.1.a:0 "Now we are on our own!"

sic.200.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"
sic.200.d:0 "Since the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been mostly focused internally. The Christian Democrats, in power since 1921, have been trying to pursue the age-old dream of land reform in the South. The lack of progress on this front, however, caused the Christian Democrat supermajority to fail in 1927, though a democratic coalition has kept power since, and made some small movements toward land reform in Campania and Capua. The rise of the opposing 'Azione Meridionale' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics, and only time will tell if they get to achieve their reactionary aims or if democracy will prevail."
sic.200.a:0 "Long live the kingdom!"

sic.201.t:0 "The Second Risorgimento"
sic.201.d:0 "As for the future of Italy, questions have slowly arisen regarding our place in the coming conflict. Peace on the peninsula is held by a delicate balance: if the syndicalists strike, they must do so without drawing the Third Internationale into battle with them. Should they do so, both Germany and Austria will feel compelled to intervene. They will not, however, feel so compelled if Two Sicilies strikes first. So it is on the Socialist Republic of Italy to make the first move towards a Second Risorgimento, and they must do so without French backing. We must keep a careful watch on the Abruzzo line, to see if they become so bold."

The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo. This paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom, for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well as disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left. Joining them is the more controversial Julius Evola whom was only reluctantly allowed into the organization for his far-right monarchist views and the small but fanatical following he brings with him, especially amongst the sons of the upper-class. Nonetheless his past anti-Papal and anti-Bourbon views marks him as divisive even within the Camicie Nere but the black-shirts desire a broad alliance... for now. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."

This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Conservative party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Popolare Italiano.

While the ACLS has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided.

However more religiously fervent and morally disgusted members of the Integralist coalition, including Bernardo Attolico, Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo have refused to pledge loyalty and simply stated that they would continue to oppose "demonic demagoguery".

Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classical civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society.

The purpose of this group is to attempt to bring the members' individual identities into such a superhuman state of power and awareness that we shall be able to exert a magical influence on the world. However, the ideas supported by UR Group members are far from uniform to say the least. From the Hermetists and Kremmerzians with their Catholic and anthroposophist Steinerian allies to the true Pagans who wish to revive ancient Roman religion as dictated by famed Roman archaeologist Giacomo Boni, the UR Group has members from nearly every major esoteric school of thought, including Urreligionists, Freemasonry, Theosophists, Esoteric Buddhists, Tantrics, Ariosophists, Orientalists, Perennialists, Neo-Pythagoreanists, students of the Sacred Mysteries, adherents to Esoteric Environmentalism, followers of Catholic Esoterics, and paradoxically even Feminists such as Evola’s not-so-secret lover Sibilla Aleramo, and more, with all of these diverse factions and more within the UR Group using magazines and journals like our ‘Introduzione alla Magia quale Scienza dell'Io’ - or the ‘Introduction to Magic as Science of the Self’ - in order to spread our message to the masses while hiding behind fake names in order to preserve an aura of mystique while also protecting themselves from possible retribution at the hands of mad doubtors.\n\nHowever, there exists two factions of growing strength within the UR Group that have become a source of concern for Evola’s dominant faction, being the Pagan Freemasons of Arturo Reghini and Amedeo Rocco Armentano, and the esoteric and imperialist Social Democrats of Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesarò. Though both factions swear fealty to Evola and the wider UR Group, both have grown in influence at a worryingly speed, leading Evola and his closest confidants and sycophants to mistakenly fear for an internal coup by the Grand Orient of Italy or by Colonna’s Democrazia Sociale that will likely never come or even be planned, for such is the paranoia of our glorious leader.

Indeed, officials of the Red Cross have filed numerous reports and protest letters to the representatives of Italian states and the international community about horrendous war crimes and massacres performed on the broken peninsula, although the state of war makes these nigh impossible to certify and investigate further. However, it seems that for once, a story about humanity and compassion has risen to the surface, as the war correspondents residing in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies have published the story of one Salvatore Todaro. A Lieutenant Commander of the Sicilian navy, Todaro is the captain of the submarine Comadante Cappellini. Two months ago, Todaro and his crew had set off to a routine patrol in the Mediterranean, seeking to sink various supply ships to the Socialists of the north. Their first and most notable action would come in the form of a British cargo ship, the Shakespear. The two vessels engaged in a long gunfight, the deck gun of Comadante Cappellini eventually emerging victorious as the Shakespear tilted dangerously and began submerging into the raging sea. Her crew abandoned the sinking ship, seeking refuge in a flock of lifeboats, although with a storm closing in, the likelihood of survival seemed slim. In an unforeseen turn of events, Todaro ordered his ship to take in the survivors and set sail towards the Canary Islands of neutral Spain, where the crew of Shakespear was eventually released into. The commander of Shakespear had expressed his bemusement at Todaro’s decision, to which the submarine captain merely replied to with 'I am a seaman like you. I am convinced that in my place you would have done the same'. After Comadante Cappellini’s return to her homeport, multiple of our officials have expressed criticism towards his decision, claiming it to be a sign of hidden sympathies or at the very least unpatriotic. This stance has been exacerbated further, as other events of similar description have come to light from Todaro’s past. Nonetheless, Salvatore Todaro has also received widespread admiration from the common people for his morality and character, and especially after the press learned of this incident, the international response has been overwhelmingly positive, partially also to our regime."

However, the initial intent of spreading their connection has grown into a full-scale mission to destroy law and order throughout Italy.

mafia.4.t:0 "Questions of Leadership and the Future of Cosa Nostra"
mafia.4.d:0 "With the dawning of a new era for Sicily and wider Italy just beginning to peak over the horizon, our coalition of mafiusu organizations from across the Mezzogiorno now stand at a crossroads as internal leadership debates begin to turn violent, forcing the hand of Don of Dons Calò Vizzini to call a shadowy and secretive conclave among our organization’s leading dons and bosses to finally decide on the future face of our coalition under Cosa Nostra once and for all. Before us now stands a few options, each leading to a different avenue towards an uncertain future. The most obvious choice would be to continue the traditionalist and paternalist leadership of Don Calò and his clique of leading dons from Cosa Nostra, the ‘Ndrangheta, and the Camorra, ruling in a decentralized and highly autonomous manner as we have always done in a form of mafioso pseudo-feudalism built on organized crime, though this approach is hounded by newer faces chomping at the bit as they rabidly call for reform and modernization. This resistance has led Don Calò to consider alternative options, such as throwing in fully with the violent nationalists and fanatical separatists within the Muvimentu pâ Nnipinnenza dâ Sicilia - or the Movement for the Independence of Sicily - who are desperate for allies in their struggle to free Sicily from peninsular woes, and whose dwindling Rightist subfaction of mostly aristocrats and old officers like Baron Lucio Tasca and Duke Guglielmo Paternò have long held secretive ties with Cosa Nostra. Opposing Vizzini and either of his plans is his own right-hand man and the ‘heir-apparent’ of the Sicilian Mafia Giuseppe Genco Russo - an infamously crude, crass, and thuggish but highly successful and ‘respected’ kingpin that holds close ties to the Democrazia Cristiana party and the Catholic clergy, along with smaller rivals like the populist politician ‘Il Comandante’ Achille Lauro who has frequently worked with the various mafias in secret in the past in order to advance his own interests, and who now seeks to legitimize our movement behind a barely-legal and official facade in the form of a corrupt and puppeted civilian government, and the young made-man Carlo Gambino, known for his close ties to our American counterparts and his desire to rebrand our mafias in a slick and modern new coat of paint centered around the spread of corrupted free market capitalism. Only one can truly be called the Capo-di-Capi however, so who shall rise - or stand his ground - as the Don of Dons?"
mafia.4.a:0 "Stick with the traditional coalition under the continued leadership of Don Calò."
mafia.4.b:0 "Don Calò aligns with the Sicilian Independence Movement to hold power."

The Government is corrupt on every single level, with every cop, representative and judge being on our payroll, and every political party in the area being loyal to us.\n\nThe bedrock of our state is now corruption, ingrained in every part of Italian society. It can no longer be destroyed or challenged. Getting rid of corruption would be paramount to getting rid of the entire state. "

mafia.7.t:0 "The Banks are made of Marble"
mafia.7.d:0 "Banks, the centres where the wealthy have stored their wealth for centuries. But now, with the Mafia controlling all assets of state, the nation’s banks have adjusted to the new and illegitimate way of life. This has led to banks serving a new purpose for the Mafioso command; wide-scale money laundering. With these new corrupt banks, we can take any illicitly acquired funds and easily clean them of their dirty origins and allow them to return to the outside and legal economy.\n\nBanks that have refused to comply with the new standards have often had their owners winding up dead.

And the ones who defied were promptly put in their place.\n\nIndeed, in Sicily our word is law, in Sicily our control is absolute, and in Sicily we can do anything we want.\n\n Our roots are in Sicily, and our home will always be in Sicily."

This would seriously hinder our ability to do business, however we can easily outrun their blockade or simply use other routes. However, a suggestion to get this embargo lifted is to make an offer to the Entente. This offer would allow the Entente forces to use the Isle of Sardinia as a launching pad to reclaim Europe, something that the Entente would surely accept given their position."

mafia.9.b:0 "Perhaps we could come to an understanding."

mafia.10.t:0 "All at a Price..."
mafia.10.d:0 "Luxury is something that has always been associated with Italian goods. When the wealthy look for quality, they turn to Italy, no matter the product. And of course, the Mafia helps with that. Any imaginable good can be found in our lands, and if it exists then we can typically make it better than anyone else can. From narcotics to cars to fashion to wine, Italy makes it better than anyone else.\n\nOf course, some of our products are more addictive than others. The elite classes across the world have gotten hooked on our drugs and have bankrupted themselves in the process. Of course, we all know what happens to people who don’t pay. "
mafia.10.a:0 "Better pay up."

High-profile opponents of the Mafia have faced assassination through many means, such as car bombings, sniper attacks, simple attacks, abductions and many more means.

However, the Mafia has sent no threats, and instead has sent an offer. This offer would allow us military access to Sardinia if the embargo is lifted.

mafia.14.d:0 "Cloaked in the shadows Southern Italy lies. As corrupt and seedy as the day is long, the Naples-Sicily region prospers in untold wealth, the Mafia controlling every facet of life. Corruption is engrained in the state, Protection Rackets are as accepted as taxes, and the government freely sells narcotics to its own citizens; fueling an addiction that only lines the pockets of corrupt commissars and bureaucrats. The Black Market and the legal economy have moulded into one, and Italy has become a world hub of less than legitimate business.\n\nIn untold wealth Italy prospers, with morality and the law holding no place in the affairs of the state."

The Don’s associates offer a spot in the secretive and shadowy Axis of Bosses, an international cabal of crime bosses and slumlords that seek to cooperate in order to benefit our shared dubious business. Side by side, we could stay out of each other's operations as we seek to expand in a united fashion, bringing greater honor and profit to our gangs, though we would have some competition that we could not just simply wipe away as before. Divided, we may fall to law enforcement and forces of order and so-called justice, but together, we may just be able to survive this turbulent time on a wave of profit and opportunity.

cathitaly.1.t:0 "Neo-Sanfedisti Activity"
cathitaly.1.d:0 "Recently, we have received several reports of Neo-Sanfedisti activity. This reactionary militia has been plaguing us since our spiritual revolution began. Their movement began after one of our more radical militias led a controversial attack on San Giovanni Rotondo. Terrified of our Revolution, these Catholic extremists banded together to form militias of their own, and have been causing trouble in the rural areas ever since. The group seems to be incredibly disunited, only united by a Leadership Council that is otherwise powerless. Despite the massive disunity, two men, Padre Renato Ziggiotti and Padre Pio are the most popular leaders within the NeoSanfedisti. The former dreams of restoring a reactionary order to Italy, unifying it in some “Holy Federation.” Pio, for his part, is more radical; The ideas of nation, class, race, and ideology disgust him. He wishes to topple our Republic and build a society united by faith. Despite this activity, it is not uncommon for the New Army of Holy Faith to vanish for months at a time and reappear either when we are at our weakest, or when our so-called anti-Catholicism is at it's strongest."

Initially, many candidates came forward with their plans, but over time it became very clear that it would either be either Padre Ziggiotti or Padre Pio’s ideas that won the day. Ziggiotti gave a rousing speech about the glorious new Italy we could build together, how we would rebuild Italy into a perfect, Holy nation, ruled by Piety and Devotion to the Lord. As his speech drew to a close, almost the entire room was filled with furious applause. Once it died down, Pio carefully stood up and began to speak. Immediately, his soothing voice and mystical aura seemed to transfix the room. He spoke about his dream of a society united by faith, of brothers and sisters coming together in harmony and love. He called for dismantling the nations and systems that keep us from being one in Christ Jesus. When he concluded, there was no applause, only awe. The debate has concluded, and though only God knows what the future holds for our movement, it is time for the Council to decide who will be our new leader."

At the same time, he has pledged compensation to the nobles whose land will be donated to the peons. Once complete, he plans to approach the Papacy in the hopes of a reunion. But if diplomacy were to fail, perhaps his Holy Federation would be one forged in blood..."

cathitaly.4.d:0 "Padre Pio is a simple man at his core. When he sees a problem, he does all he can to solve it. When he hears confessions, he can read the soul of the penitent, and can tell them how to truly save their souls. Thus it is with the grand problem of humanity. Pio believes he has seen the signs; he knows why the Socialists and Nationalists rose up-he knows why they reject God. They reject God due to not knowing him. They don't know God due to poor catechism. They had poor catechism due to the distractions of nation, of war, and of bad examples of the faith.\n How does one fix that? How can you attack the root cause of society's ills? Simple. You remove the nation, race, class. You give a good model of faith to the children. And what after that? Once man is solely focused on God, you will know you have solved the problem.\n This solution, once it is successful in the south of Italy, cannot be held within her borders alone. No, the entire Church must fall and come to embrace this truth, this grand vision of Padre Pio. Once the Church has tasted this vision, Pio's vision will be carried to the four corners of the world, so that he can bring man to his true and most glorious end: life with Christ in Heaven above, forever."

Worse still, they profane our faith while cloaked in the image of the Virgin Maria. Just as Christ drove the materialistic money-changers from His Father’s House, so too must we drive these monsters from the Kingdom of God. At the same time, we face a wicked, ancient threat. Julius Evola and his Legions are a relic of the cruel past that Christ saved man from.

After all, they are dangerous men, and the last thing we need is for them to corrupt our ranks with their trickery. Another camp preaches mercy for the monsters. To them, these are our brothers in faith, misguided by worldly greed. If we show them mercy, they could become a powerful ally as well.

We knew the battle had been won from the very moment Christ sacrificed Himself on the cross. Our men retreated behind our artillery emplacements as the Legionaries surged forward. It was then that the guns roared like the trumpets at Mount Zemaraim. After the devastating barrage, our counter attack began.

As you know, my years in the Socialist Republic had convinced me that the Church and everything to do with it was all puttanata.  After the First Reading, which recounted the Parable of the Sower I had enjoyed when I was a boy, none other than Padre Ziggiotti began the Homily.\n Somehow, I was enthralled by his words. Oh, how he had such a way with words! He told us of the importance of faith, that without it a void is left in our hearts, and creates sorrow and misfortune. Before I had realized what I had done, I interrupted to blurt out, “But Padre, how does one attain and keep the faith?” People from every pew turned to face me with disgusted looks. But Padre Ziggiotti only laughed gently before answering. “My son, faith is attained through our works. We can express faith through our words, but it is our deeds that truly show that we seek and believe. Walk the path of righteousness, and you will find yourself empowered with faith, that wonderful gift. With belief in God by your side, my son, nothing is impossible.”\n To tell you the truth, few words have moved me as much as the ones he spoke before continuing the Mass. I think I have finally become grateful for the baptism Mama and Papa gave me all those years ago. But now I must get back to work. But thank you, Viola, for everything."

Backed by his Neosanfedist militias, Padre Ziggotti has returned the mighty light of God to these heathens, basking the south in the Holy Light of the Lord once more! With his rule cemented, he has sent a request of reunion to the Holy See here in the north. Though Padre Ziggotti may have a reputation for violence against the godless syndicalists, he is still a man of the cloth and a true son of God in our eyes, no matter how misguided he may have once been.

These sinners to the north have denied our humble request at making our broken nation whole again, but this will be the last time the north turns their back on us and on the Lord. Under Padre Ziggotti’s command, our brave Army of the Holy Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ shall storm north like the crusaders of old and wipe clean the slate of these disgraceful heretics.

Such concepts have no place in the new society we are building, for devotion is to be reserved for God and His Church. Pio recognizes this, and has begun to take measures to cleanse his realm of these wicked ideas. All clergy, officers and politicans of any rank or stipe even suspected of harboring nationalist or socialist sympathies are to be stripped of their positions. They still have a place in Pio’s vision, but it is certainly not one where they have any influence. The journey to finally be free from that which strays us from God has begun at last."

In order to fully remove that great idol of nationalism, a radical strike must be made. The way to make this strike, in the mind of the great Padre Pio, is twofold. Firstly, the state must be made incredibly decentralized, and all political power will be held by the village in the countryside and in the district within the city. All governmental functions, save for a few powers, namely the military and education, will be handled at the most local level. Doing this will no doubt cause chaos for a short period, but it is necessary to finally remove the idol of nationalism.\n Secondly, national monuments, monuments to the people who united Italy and to the past glories of this nation, must be dealt with. While obviously the people will not take kindly to the destruction of what was, Pio has no intention to destroy these modern day golden calves. They shall be put on display in every town and city in museums and places of shame. This will be done to show our history, for we must not destroy our past, but it will also show the people what we have risen above. In place of the removed monuments, great statues of Our Lord and His Most Blessed Mother, of the blessed Saints, will be raised, to give our people true models to look up to."

cathitaly.16.d:0 "As Padre Pio has begun to implement his glorious vision in southern Italy over the past several months, it is becoming increasingly clear that not only is his vision successful; it works far better then anyone could have predicted. People of all races, classes, and nationalities are working side-by-side, helping each other get to Heaven.\n  His vision has now been proven to be more than just an idea in the head of a visionary, and the second and perhaps most grand phase is about to begin. This phase will involve the implementation of the vision of Pio throughout the entire Church. The only way to achieve that, in the mind of our saintly leader, is to call an Ecumenical Council, a thing only the Holy Father can do. While Padre Pio is a loyal son of Rome, there is no way the current pontiff would entertain Pio's ideas about reform and councils. Thus, our holy Padre has scheduled a meeting with the Vicar of Christ to discuss the reunion of the two halves of Italy, among other things. Padre Pio has his eyes on the Papacy, and with God on his side, how could he fail?"
cathitaly.16.a:0 "If the Lord wills our success, how could Padre Pio fail?"

cathitaly.17.t:0 "A Meeting With His Holiness"
cathitaly.17.d:0 "Padre Pio arrived at the Papal Palace in Rome at 8am today, and was taken to see His Holiness at 8:30. As Padre Pio knelt to kiss the ring of the Holy Father, the door to the Roman Pontiff's office closed, not to open until 11:30 that night. What the two men discussed for the next 12 hours was not recorded, but the effects of the meeting would be felt early the next morning.\n On the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, the Vicar of Christ announced his resignation. He was the first pope to do so in centuries, and that was not all. In his place, His Holiness declared that no conclave would take place, but that instead, Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, leader of the Apostolic State of Southern Italy, would be the next Bishop of Rome.\n Reactions to this announcement have been... mixed to say the least. The Cardinals of the Church have not issued any statement yet, but a handful of theologians have declared this move illegal. Either way, with Padre Pio now becoming the so-called  “Pope-Elect“, it is expected he will attempt to unite Italy before his coronation."
cathitaly.17.a:0 "The Papacy must submit to the will of His Holiness!"

cathitaly.18.a:0 "Worrying, either way, we await word from the South"

cathitaly.19.t:0 "Pio Demands our Submission!"
cathitaly.19.d:0 "As expected, the Apostolic State of South Italy has formally requested that we unite under one government. His Holiness-elect, the nominal head of the city of Rome, is well within his rights to do this, and by all accounts we are legally bound to follow his request. However, this has not stopped some within our government from begging us to refuse. Pio's state in southern Italy is apparently an abomination of what he is calling 'Nationless Catholicism', a system that, in practice, sees nationalism, socialism, and class conflict as horrible and unites the people under the banner of Catholicism. This comes at the cost of nearly any semblance of modernity. While we are legally bound, the argument of these members of our government is compelling. With this in mind, the College of Cardinals has gathered to hold an emergency vote on what to do in regards to the demand from Pio"
cathitaly.19.a:0 "He is the rightful Roman Pontiff, we must obey"
cathitaly.19.b:0 "He may be pope-elect but we are still a nation! We will never submit to this upstart!"

cathitaly.20.t:0 "The Papacy agrees to join the Apostolic State"
cathitaly.20.d:0 "Following an emergency vote by the College of Cardinals,  the Italian Federation has agreed to a formal union of our two states, under the guidance of the Pope-elect Pio. With this acceptance, the process of integration can begin at last. Once the Federation has been formally annexed and Rome is within our hands, Padre Pio will finally be crowned Pope."
cathitaly.20.a:0 "At long last, Italy grows closer to unification!"

cathitaly.21.t:0 "The Papacy Refuses to Submit!"
cathitaly.21.d:0 "Following an emergency vote by the College of Cardinals,  the Italian Federation has refused our offer to reunite peacefully. While this comes as somewhat of a shock to some, it is not so to Padre Pio. This was to be expected in his eyes; the institutional Church has always been afraid of reform, and Pio's reforms would be more radical than most. With this decision being made, the time has come for battle. The men and women of the NeoSanfedisti stand ready to retake the North-they only await the Padre's word."
cathitaly.21.a:0 "The Die has been Cast"

cathitaly.23.t:0 "The Elevation of Pope-Elect Pio"
cathitaly.23.d:0 "With Rome now firmly in the hands of Saint Peter's rightful successor, the investiture and coronation of Padre Pio can finally take place. The person to consecrate Pio a bishop is Cardinal Selvaggiani, the dean of the College of Cardinals...\n The consecration of Pio was a simple matter, as in the minds of all, the period of Sede Vacant had gone on long enough. After the ceremony, the Dean of the College was quick to run to the balcony overlooking St. Peter's square and speak those words that the faithful of not just Rome, but the whole world have been waiting for: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum, Habemus Papam! Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum Francesco Forgione, qui sibi nomen imposuit..."
cathitaly.23.a:0 "...Leo!”"
cathitaly.23.b:0 "...Paulus!”"
cathitaly.23.c:0 "...Gregorius”!"

cathitaly.24.t:0 "Addressing the Cardinals"
cathitaly.24.d:0 "“Your eminences, I assure you that I bear no hostility to you. But, my vision is the path we are to follow, and I will beg for your support if I must.” Cardinal Faulhauber spoke first, “[SIC.GetLeader],  I believe I speak for the majority of my fellow Cardinals when I say that our faith in you is shallow. You were not elected by the College. In fact, you have never been one of us. You are an upstart in over your head, and this dream of yours will bring this Church to ruin.” There seemed to be no anger in the Pontiff’s voice as he responded, “Your Eminence, I am to be addressed as Your Holiness. I beg of you to have faith in me and my leadership. I am unorthodox, yes, but I am also nonetheless as faithful a servant of the Lord as any one of you. His Holiness chose me, and thus I am a part of the sacred line that began with Simon Peter. Must I beg you not to split the Church by electing a new Pope?” Now it was Cardinal Baudrillart’s turn. “It is an insult to God to have someone so blasphemous as you lead our Church, and every moment that we do not choose a new Pontiff is another moment we are ruled by a fraud.” The Pope calmly removed the covers on his hands, and revealed his stigmata to his audience. At once, they were silenced, amazed by his wounds and the blood that flowed from them."
cathitaly.24.a:0 "Thou hast seen me, and thou hast believed."

cathitaly.25.t:0 "Addressing the Laity"
cathitaly.25.d:0 "“Brothers and Sisters, I come before you not as the Pontifex Maximus, but as your brother in faith. Brother Nikolić spoke up, “Your Holiness. We are enthused to welcome you into this humble monastery, but some of us still have doubts about this vision of yours and the miracles attributed to you. The Pope smiled warmly, and gently answered, “My Brother, I understand your doubts. But I beg you to keep your faith. All things are possible for one who believes.” Sister Verini, who was paralyzed, was helped to kneel her before her Pontiff. “Your Holiness, the Lord is with you. Blessed be your name! For you are my leader in faith, and I have faith in you.” The Pope removed his mittens, holding up his wounded hands to those before him. Looking upon the wounds of Christ on the Pope’s hands, they were transfixed. He took his hands in hers, and began to say a prayer. “My friends, behold my hands. Sister Verini has not witnessed them until now, and yet, she believed. You doubted until you saw. Now rise, Sister Verini.” Sister Verini stood up, and began to cry tears of joy. At once, they all knelt before him, and begged for forgiveness."
cathitaly.25.a:0 "For we walk by faith, not by sight."

cathitaly.26.t:0 "Opening of the Second Vatican Council"
cathitaly.26.d:0 "Following almost a year of work and preparation, the bishops of the world, or their appointed representatives, now sit together in the Second Vatican Council. The first session of the Council begins with a beautiful three hour long mass prayed  by the Holy Father. In his homily, the Holy Father called on all of those gathered to carry out the business of the Council reverently and quickly. What changes are to come from the Council remain to be seen, but the door to radical change in the Catholic Church is now open, and whether or not His Holiness will push the Council through this door remains to be seen."
cathitaly.26.a:0 "The Council is open for business!"

cathitaly.27.t:0 "The Second Vatican Council is Traditionalist"
cathitaly.27.d:0 "Deep within the hallowed halls of St. Peter’s Basilica, the Second Vatican Council deliberates over its sacred task. With the initial arguments out of the way, it has been decided to move the Church in a far more traditionalist direction. Championed by the more conservative old guard of the Church Fathers, the Council has agreed that a return to the old ways is best for the Catholic world as a whole. Latin shall be reinforced as the dominant language and script of the Church, while ultramontanism shall be fully embraced, granting His Holiness greater powers than his position has held in centuries. Under the newly strengthened Pope, the Catholic world shall be carried into the future on the back of tradition."
cathitaly.27.a:0 "We cast away the debauchery of the modern age and return to the old ways"

cathitaly.28.t:0 "The Second Vatican Council is Moderate"
cathitaly.28.d:0 "As the esteemed Church Fathers begin their deliberation behind the sealed gates of the Vatican, they have come to an agreement over the general direction of the Second Vatican Council. The wise holy men have come to the agreement to not radically alter the teachings or positions of the Church at all, instead seeking to tow the line and maintain the status-quo. The experiments with the common vernacular shall be allowed to take place, with Latin remaining the dominant and official language of the Church. While a fine balance will be maintained between the fanatics that follow the teachings of  Pope Paul VI and the conservative traditionalists within the Church. Only by maintaining a balance can the Church survive and grace the world with its enlightening aura."
cathitaly.28.a:0 "We have resisted the temptation of extremism, walking a delicate balance between tradition and reform"

cathitaly.29.t:0 "The Second Vatican Council is Reformist"
cathitaly.29.d:0 "Behind the ornate doors of St. Peter's Basilica, the Second Vatican Council was well under way, with the meeting of Council Fathers gathering to discuss the future direction of the Catholic Church. After hours of deliberation, these most pious of men have come to an initial agreement on the general direction of this most holy meeting of minds. The Council has voted to realign our ideals along the radical reformist ideas of Pope Gregory XVII, propelling the Church into a new, zealous direction. The Holy Father’s ideals of Catholicism first, above all other creeds and theories, have rung true with the Council Fathers. Under this new direction, worldly ideologies such as syndicalism, capitalism, or nationalism shall be abandoned in pursuit of something far holier and closer to God’s original plan. We shall shed the dividers of race, class, and nation as we spread the light of the Lord across God’s Kingdom of Earth. With Pope Gregory XVII’s teachings forming the bedrock of our new creed, Catholicism shall reign over mankind as the one true faith!"
cathitaly.29.a:0 "Gregory XVII’s teachings shall lead the Catholic World into a brighter, holier future!"


cathitaly.30.t:0 "Decree on Freemasonry?"
cathitaly.30.d:0 "Of all the various heretical movements in history, none have received more papal condemnations than Freemasonry. This is due primarily to the heresy of relativism, among what others would call more conspiratorial reasons. Regardless, several more traditional minded Council Fathers have formally put before our most holy Council a document that boils down every single papal condemnation into one along with some comentary for our modern times. After a short period of debate, the Council Fathers vote and decide that..."
cathitaly.30.a:0 "...the repeated Papal condemnations are enough, we have no need to waste time with what the faithful already know"
cathitaly.30.b:0 "...the time has come for a formal Councillor condemnation of Freemasonary"

cathitaly.31.t:0 "Decree on Capitalism?"
cathitaly.31.d:0 "From the very beginning of what today has become known as Catholic Social Teaching, Capitalism has lived in a bit of a grey area. While Unrestricted Capitalism has been outright condemn, the other various forms of Capitalism, such as the so-called Social Capitalism and Interventionist Capitalism have not been, leaving many of the faithful confused as to what counts as a moral economic system in the eyes of Holy Mother Church.\n It is with this in mind that a few Church Fathers of a more progressive or reformist bent have put forward for the consideration of the Council a decree that would outline a detailed teaching on the various forms of Capitalism, and would lay out what they have entitled 'Christian Capitalism.' After a period of debate, the Second Vatican Council votes that...   "
cathitaly.31.a:0 "...This so-called Christian Capitalism is nothing more than socialism in Catholic Clothing! We are duty bound to reject it!" 
cathitaly.31.b:0 "...Christian Capitalism is the future of Catholic Social Teaching!"

cathitaly.32.t:0 "End of the Second Vatican Council"
cathitaly.32.d:0 "After a long period of trials and tribulations, the Second Vatican Council has finally come to end. The Council Fathers have left Rome and returned home, and in their wake have left a Church much different from the one of a short time ago. Regardless of how the Council went, the Catholic Church, at least for the time being, is a buzz with change and a renewed spirit. With his main agenda completed, it is expected of the Holy Father to make some kind of statement regarding what's next for the Catholic Church."
cathitaly.32.a:0 "We wait with baited breath Holy Father!"

cathitaly.33.t:0 "Into the World?"
cathitaly.33.d:0 "The Second Vatican Council has at long last finished their endless deliberations, and a definite path has been set for this holy state and the entire Catholic Church. Under the guidance of the Lord’s holy light, our New Army of Holy Faith shall march out from the lands of the Holy See and spread God’s wisdom and warmth around the world. However, a final question remains on what shall be the nature of the NeoSanfedisti as they carry out the Lord’s good works.\n Our armies can become forces of peace and forgiveness, working with both the clergy and the laity to spread God’s good will to the rest of His misguided flock. Under this mission, we shall take their tired, their poor, their downtrodden, and their bereaved, and we shall lift these meek souls from the mud so they too can inherit the Earth and live in God’s good graces.\n In sharp contrast to this, our armies can march forth from these lands of the Holy See, carrying the vengeful fire and spirit of God’s wrath, smiting the myriad of heretics and heathens that plague this Garden of Eden. Under the command of our brave officers and generals, inspired by the light of the Lord himself, a tenth crusade will be declared; this time, not just for the Holy Land in the Levant, but for all of God’s holy lands. One way or another, we will bring the Church, and the light of Christ to the entire world, so that it touches every single soul, sinner and saint alike."
cathitaly.33.a:0 ""Deus Vult! The time has come to spread God’s light to every nation on Earth!"
cathitaly.33.b:0 "The Church will cleanse these lands without needless bloodshed."

cathitaly.34.t:0 "Choosing a Banner to Rally Our Faith Behind"
cathitaly.34.d:0 "With Padre Pio’s ascension following the "Papal Crisis", this honored and devoutly pious servant of God has become both the national leader of our beauteous and pristine state, as well as the head of the Christian World and the Catholic Church. With this position, a great deal of pressure has been placed upon His Holiness' shoulders as he takes his seat amid one of the most tumultuous times in modern history. In order to solidify the people’s faith in both their new Pope and their new state, the Pontiff has called for a small meeting to be held to determine the new flag of his hand crafted state. This banner shall be the symbol of our nation and of our faith - something new to rally behind as we walk through this new valley of death towards our bright horizon, guided and shepherded by both Successor of Saint Peter and the Lord’s Holy Light."
cathitaly.34.a:0 "Rally behind the old naval flag depicting Peter, Paul and Christ."
cathitaly.34.b:0 "Raise a new banner depicting the Keys of Heaven."
cathitaly.34.c:0 "The new Peter and Paul flag design shall serve us well."
cathitaly.34.e:0 "We shall use the Peter, Paul and Christ banner, but modernized."
cathitaly.34.f:0 "Adorn the standard flag of the Papacy!"
cathitaly.34.g:0 "Take notes from the Swiss Guard’s standard."
cathitaly.34.h:0 "Under the watch of the Virgin Mary, our people shall be safe."

cathitaly.36.t:0 "The Legacy of the Two Sicilies"
cathitaly.36.d1:0 "As nobles that fled finally have the chance to return to their former homes in our new state, monarchists amongst our number have proposed enthroning the Bourbons as the heads of our holy state, in the image of our namesakes who fought for the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies. Such a move would surely bolster our legitimacy in the eyes of Italians in the North as well as the South, but numerous protests can already be heard throughout our new state. The already unruly population under us grows restless, as many brand a return to monarchy as a return to the ideals that resulted in our defeat in 1919. After all, we have just recently gained power in the South, and such a move would be reckless. However, our military is confident that they can enforce cooperation amongst the people for the return of the monarchy. How shall we proceed?"
cathitaly.36.d2:0 "As nobles that fled return to their former homes in our new state, monarchists among our number have proposed rejoining the Bourbon kingdom in the north, in the image of our namesakes who fought for the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies, and in the process reconcile with the north. A bloodless resolution to the Civil War would surely be the best choice for the Italian nation that has lost so much already, but do we trust the northerners to guide our united nation to prosperity? The tension between North and South is still palpable, with many within our ranks outright decrying the corrupt rule of the North. The Austrian hand slinks deep within Milan and Rome, no doubt. However, the choice is ultimately up to us, though war with the North would likely be wildly unpopular amongst our people."
cathitaly.36.a:0 "Enthrone the Bourbons, The Two Sicilies live again!."
cathitaly.36.b:0 "Send an envoy north, the Bourbons shall receive their birthright."
cathitaly.36.c:0 "We don't need them, our faithful rule alone."

cathitaly.37.t:0 "Revival of Two Sicilies?"
cathitaly.37.d:0 "When the Socialists in the South fell to the uprising of the Catholic Neosanfedisti, many wondered what their rise would hold in store for the future of Italy and our Kingdom, but it seems fortune may smile upon us, they have recognized the old Bourbon claim to the Two Sicilies and have extended us an olive branch. They humbly request to continue to have some say in government through representatives and advisors to the King. While this is truly the best outcome, many within our government are wary of allowing such zealous radicals to remain within our administration. But, surely, this is better than spilling the blood of thousands of Italian young men, is it not?"
cathitaly.37.a:0 "Our birthright is secure!."
cathitaly.37.b:0 "We cannot trust these fanatics in the slightest."

cathitaly.38.t:0 "The Restoration of the Two Sicilies"
cathitaly.38.d:0 "The north has sent back word with approval of the restoration, The Kingdom of Two Sicilies lives and peace in Italy is assured. The North has been reconciled with the South without the slaughter of Italian citizens. Rejoice, for never again will we be divided! Our short-lived independence in the 19th century will last for a thousand years! There will be growing pains, of course, but these pains are better than the pain of thousands of grieving mothers."
cathitaly.38.a:0 "Viva o rre cu Fagmiglia."

cathitaly.39.t:0 "The Bourbons rebuke us!"
cathitaly.39.d:0 "The Bourbon Kingdom of the north has sent back word, they rebuke us, calling us fanatics, zealots and radicals! After such a humble offer, we thought for sure that they would agree to reunification, but it seems that they are more interested in politics than the Italian people. The Austrians have done enough meddling in the North, that they identify more with Vienna than Napoli! We have done all we can. If Italy is to live again, the Northerners must submit to our guidance. Otherwise, we will be slaves to the Hun and Communard for eternity, and the teachings of Christ will be lost. This cannot be! We must secure the sovereignty of our people, even if they resist us."
cathitaly.39.a:0 "Ca v'abbrucia lu panare!."

cathitaly.40.t:0 "The Restoration of the Bourbons"
cathitaly.40.d:0 "The North Italians have decided to restore the Bourbon dynasty, binding their nation to ours under one king. The massive fortifications and bunkers along Rome and Anzio are being dismantled, as our diplomats and administration discuss how to formalize the reunification. Both armies have stood down and are in the arduous process of combining their doctrines and equipment into one Italian army. Families have been reunited, and the whole nation can breathe a collective sigh as Italy has been reunited without further struggle or conflict. The King, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been crowned in Rome, with full support from the Pope. In a speech to Rome, [ROOT.GetLeader], beset by jubilant crowds of people grateful for a new day of stable, optimistic peace, praised both the North and South for seeing the wisdom in pacifism. Celebrations have erupted throughout all of our nation. May we see this peace forever!"
cathitaly.40.a:0 "Viva o rre cu Fagmiglia."

cathitaly.41.t:0 "One Kingdom for Italy"
cathitaly.41.d:0 "Ever since the Civil War, Italy has been divided between multiple administrations, a state of affairs which was maintained even when they were nominally reunited under the House of Bourbon. Safer waters have been reached as the Neosanfedisti has destroyed the rule of the godless Communards in the North. In its stead remained a rule that was more amicable to the South. However, it has come time to mend ourselves into one nation proper, leaving only one gaping question: which ought to take primacy, between the monarchist South and Neosanfedisti North. Representatives of both have met in Rome to discuss the fate of the nation. After days upon days of fiery debate and discourse, who has won the final Italian struggle?"
cathitaly.41.a:0 "The Neosanfedisti come out in triumph."

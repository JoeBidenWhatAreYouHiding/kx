SIC_focus:0 "Two Sicilies Focus Tree"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last twenty years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a member of the Italian Federation and now a sovereign nation. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

SIC_theshipyardmatter_desc:0 "Sicily has, for more than a decade, greatly profited from the use of its large drydocks to sell warships to various nations in these troubled times.

SIC_barbones_air_tree3:0 "IMAM Subsidies"

SIC_organic_kingdom_desc:0 "The Two Sicilies are one, and yet many. Each castle, each village and each house, product of centuries of incredible history and brave accomplishments.

SIC_secret_police_desc:0 "Many foul republicans roam the streets of the kingdom, seeking to spread jacobin anarchy even now. They could be on the other side of your very window... listening to us, and plotting in sewers like the rats they are."

SIC_ride_the_tiger_desc:0 "Baron Julius Evola and his radical traditionalists have finally managed to overthrow the meek state of Two Sicilies.

SIC_knights_of_the_grail:0 "Knights of the Grail"
SIC_knights_of_the_grail_desc:0 "In order to carry out our goals we will need more than loosely organized militias. The Knights of the Grail, named for adventures whom went on that ancient journey, is a highly-esteemed society made up of our most loyal militants armed with our best equipment so that they may answer directly to the Soveriegn without question and cast his enemies into darkness forever."
SIC_aristocratic_funding:0 "Aristocratic Funding"
SIC_aristocratic_funding_desc:0 "While our cause was already supported by a handful of aristocratic exiles our victory should remove doubt as to our ability to come to power.

SIC_confiscate_wealth_desc:0 "There is still property and riches belonging to loyalists of the old order, foreigners and gangsters that exist only to enrich these modernizing degenerates while pushing society further into chaos.

SIC_destroy_liberalism:0 "Destroy Liberalism"
SIC_destroy_liberalism_desc:0 "At long last we can do away with that system which has made man decadent, weak and pampered.

SIC_integralist_complaceny:0 "Integralist Complacency"
SIC_integralist_complaceny_desc:0 "The integralists are on the verge of greatness but they have stopped short by giving into traditional Christian slave morality and desiring a corporatist economy that collaborates with capitalist powers.

SIC_a_proper_king:0 "A Real King"
SIC_a_proper_king_desc:0 "It's finally time to finally replace the liberal, foreign Bourbon rule whose very existence was a mockery to our traditions with our traditional nobles.

SIC_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
SIC_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
SIC_hit_papacy:0 "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SIC_hit_papacy_desc:0 "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership. The time for their worship of the Pope over the state, and his message of meekness and charity, ends now."
SIC_platonic_church:0 "A Platonic Church"
SIC_platonic_church_desc:0 "The Papal States armies may have fallen but the Church itself still has too much influence to do away with at the moment.

SIC_ghibelline_revival:0 "Ghibelline Revival"
SIC_ghibelline_revival_desc:0 "Against the Mercantilist Guelphs the Ghibelline understood that spiritual power should rest with the Emperor alone. Their loss helped usher in the fall of man from rule by the Nobles to Mercantilists so we must revive their legacy. This may turn the tide and as the one closest to the transcendence the King has total authority over religious law with the Papacy being grateful for what they get."
SIC_finish_the_church:0 "Finish the Papacy"
SIC_finish_the_church_desc:0 "Just as their can be no compromise with liberal modernism their can be none with the Papacy which espouses a nonsense faith that undermines our leadership and with it our very Spirit.

SIC_patriarchial_traditions_desc:0 "While the correlation between masculinity and greatness is undeniable many of our foes insist on forms of "female equality" against all hard evidence to the contrary that this is a degeneration of society.

SIC_legionary_order:0 "Legionary Order"
SIC_legionary_order_desc:0 "It is time to establish an official political class based on the values that should that be rewarded; vitality, traditionalism, strength and loyalty.

SIC_heroic_idealism:0 "Heroic Idealism"
SIC_heroic_idealism_desc:0 "It is through heroic experiences that we not only create men but super-men whom display the best of their nation and find themselves in war, until the act becomes holy itself. Death on the battlefield is nothing to fear for it is the effective overcoming of death itself. We must idealize the hero as the Romans, Spartans and Teutonic Knights did."
SIC_ascetic_values:0 "Ascetic Values"
SIC_ascetic_values_desc:0 "Modernism has chained the species to material wants, the lowest of desires.

Let us advocate and respect asceticism."
SIC_blood_and_spirit:0 "Blood and Spirit"
SIC_blood_and_spirit_desc:0 "We are the descendants of the Atlanteans, the Hyperboreans and the Romans making us capable of containing a nation with the best of traditions and formative energies.

SIC_sardinias_final_offer:0 "Sardinia's Final Offer"
SIC_sardinias_final_offer_desc:0 "Sardinia rightfully belongs to the House of Savoy and while Amadeo's stance against the socialists is admirable it is not his place to dispute Emmanuel's claim. Despite so far seeming to view us as "extreme" he will be a given a chance to submit and join the nobility in our greater state, if not it will have to be done by bloodshed."
SIC_iron_guard_alliance:0 "Our Fellow Legion"
SIC_iron_guard_alliance_desc:0 "There is a Legion of Warriors whom have also come to reject modernity in favor of a national-mysticism that allows men to come into contact with the very soul of their nation.

SIC_strike_consumerism:0 "Strike Consumerism"
SIC_strike_consumerism_desc: "The liberal capitalists and business owners continue to peddle consumerist and materialist nonsense to our nation, weakening their spirit in favor of hedonism.

SIC_magical_societies:0 "Occult Societies"
SIC_magical_societies_desc:0 "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism. Occult societies will encourage brotherhood, faith and cooperation between the Order and their admirers and accelate our society toward containing at its core an esoteric soul."
SIC_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"
SIC_constrained_science_desc:0 "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration. Technology and studies that encourage decadence will end with all such remaining resources being cenralized by the state and put only towards the practical matter of fighting off the allies of decadence."
SIC_spiritual_casteism:0 "Spiritual Casteism"
SIC_spiritual_casteism_desc:0 "At long last the King and our Warrior-Nobility have established total dominance. We must now recognize our internal nations, or castes, so that each individual may live up to their full potential as they were intended to. With the slaves, serfs and merchants having to answer to the nobility and each being given the form of justice they deserve, nothing can stop us."
SIC_sovereign_beyond_state:0 "Sovereign Beyond State"
SIC_sovereign_beyond_state_desc:0 "At long last we have a sovereign whom can officially be beyond the laws of man, whose word should be the final one in all legal and spiritual matters and whom is as close to the higher powers that be than any of us can hope to be. Even our Warrior-Nobility must understand that he embodies Tradition and is to be worshipped as such."
SIC_the_west:0 "The West"
SIC_the_west_desc:0 "Western Europe was once the domain of the greatest empire to live followed by feudal societies that celebrated noble virtue. Now it is decimated by socialism and Papal influence. We must retake Gaul and Hispania and bring them back to their rightful place."

SIC_restore_the_old_world_desc:0 "Little has been more difficult to witness than the greatness of Austria and Greece, once the bastions of the Holy Roman and Macedonian Empires respectively and in the case of the latter Sparta, being degenerated by liberalism and modernism.

SIC_the_vikings_desc:0 "Scandanavia was once the bastion of Warrior virtues, expecting its ruling class to engage in warfare and plunder. But look upon it now, an outlet of leftism and consumerism that is less than a shadow of the beauty it once was. We must right the wrongs of the present."
SIC_the_barbarians:0 "The Barbarians"
SIC_the_barbarians_desc:0 "The Huns had done humanity a great service in the first Great War by pushing back against the forces of modernist republicanism. But now they simply use their position to feed a lazy, limp-wristed aristocracy and their capitalist desires while holding off war with socialists for as long as possible. It's time for Rome to take on the Barbarian hordes once and for all and restore their virality."
SIC_the_east:0 "Arabs and Parthians"
SIC_the_east_desc:0 "The Far East is filled with foes whom will make for great warfare, including our old foes in Iran.

sic.1.t:0 "The Legacy of the Civil War"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, which lasted until 1860 when Sardinia-Piedmont, aided by Garibaldi's partisans, united Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoyards, who did not care much for industrialising the south, and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Italy eventually chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians signed an armistice in 1919, in which they were allowed to occupy Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. However, outraged nationalists, republicans and socialists rose up against the government for their foolhardy actions in starting a war they were doomed to lose, and when King Victor Emanuel and his son abdicated, the Kingdom of Italy collapsed into anarchy. Civil war soon convulsed the peninsula, and hope seemed lost for the White forces in the south of Italy until the Austrians rejoined the war, in exchange for southern participation in a new political system - the Italian Federation. The Austrians pushed back the syndicalists from Lombardy, and the syndicalist pressure on the Abruzzo line was removed. Following the ceasefire, the south joined the Italian Federation as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but it was always with the understanding that only the promise of Austrian aid kept the Federation intacy. When the syndicalists threatened the south in 1927, Austria's promises of protection vanished... and while the war never materialized, the worth of the Federation was revealed. The Two Sicilies, the Papal State and Sardinia withdrew, leaving Austria's only place of influence the republic in the north."

The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Doje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics, and only time will tell if they get to achieve their reactionary aims or if democracy will prevail."

So it is on the Socialist Republic of Italy to make the first move towards a Second Risorgimento, and they must do so without French backing. We must keep a careful watch on the Abruzzo line, to see if they become so bold."

sic.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting our kingdom hard, poverty has skyrocketed and the living standards of many Sicilians have plunged. At the same time, the various criminal cartels and mafiosos have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something."
sic.3.a:0 "Something must be done!"

sic.4.t:0 "The Camicie Nere"
sic.4.d:0 "With the rise of crime in the country due to Black Monday, the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale have been formed. The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo. Supposedly led by Achille Stanation, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom, for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well as disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left. Joining Stanation is the more controversial Julius Evola whom was only reluctantly allowed into the organization for his far-right monarchist views and the small but fanatical following he brings with him, especially amongst the sons of the upper-class. Nonetheless his past anti-Papal and anti-Bourbon views marks him as divisive even within the Camicie Nere but the black-shirts desire a broad alliance... for now. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
sic.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them."

sic.5.t:0 "A Call for New Leadership"
sic.5.d:0 "The Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi, has given a stern and powerful sermon claiming that the government's Social Conservative policies are ruining the kingdom and are at fault for Black Monday. He says that it is time for the kingdom to have new leadership with new ideas. Many that support the Social Liberal Democrazia Cristiana have taken this as a sign, and are energised by his rhetoric."

sic.6.d:0 "Since the founding of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, parliamentary power has been contested primarily by the Social Conservatives and the Social Liberals. However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Conservative party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Democratico Cristiano. For the liberals though there is hope that this new coalition will keep the torch of liberalism strong within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies."

This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."

However, such a move seems to many as not dissimilar to syndicalism. Thus a more moderate form has been proposed as a counter by the Democrazia Cristiana, which has some attraction even among some of the conservatives.

While not all citizens have embraced us this may mark the end of our largest internal political resistance.

Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classical civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society. On the other hand he could inspire soldiers by allowing them to take concubines via conquest if their Commander allows it as well. What shall he do?"

We could attempt to capture the city with the troops although we would likely lose many men in the process. Or, ironically, we could learn from the legacy of Cesare Borgia only with the Papacy on the receiving end this time and use artillery bombardment to force their surrender.

One is to allow them to organize into their own hierarchies modeled on our values for those whom pledge loyalty to the King, pay tribute, pledge soldiers to our wars and acknowledge the Kings and his Nobles supremacy. This way we can use the best of the aristocratic spirit that exists amongst themselves for our own purposes.

Luckily, these are nothing but inconveniences to us, as we can easily send in our forces both in the Mafia and National Army to crush these rebels. "
mafia.5.a:0 "As Expected."

mafia.6.t:0 "The Gears of State"
mafia.6.d:0 "In our lands, corruption is no longer a problem to be rooted out by a noble few, it is both a means and a way of life. The Government is corrupt on every single level, with every cop, representative and judge being on our payroll, and every political party in the area being loyal to us. \n\n The bedrock of our state is now corruption, ingrained in every part of Italian society. It can no longer be destroyed or challenged. Getting rid of corruption would be paramount to getting rid of the entire state. "
mafia.6.a:0 "And why would we?"

mafia.7.t:0 "The Banks are made of Marble"
mafia.7.d:0 "Banks, the centres where the wealthy have stored their wealth for centuries. But now, with the Mafia controlling all assets of state, the nation’s banks have adjusted to the new and illegitimate way of life. This has led to banks serving a new purpose for the Mafioso command; wide-scale money laundering. With these new corrupt banks, we can take any illicitly acquired funds and easily clean them of their dirty origins and allow them to return to the outside and legal economy. \n\n Banks that have refused to comply with the new standards have often had their owners winding up dead. "
mafia.7.a:0 "More Money for us."

mafia.8.t:0 "Back in Sicily"
mafia.8.d:0 "While the original home of the Mafia is in Sicily, situation has forced us to spread northwards. Of course, this thinning of our forces in Sicily has given a select group of rabble rousers the idea to defy our rule and refuse our rackets. Luckily though, our rule in Sicily is as strong as ever. And the ones who defied were promptly put in their place.\n\n Indeed, in Sicily our word is law, in Sicily our control is absolute, and in Sicily we can do anything we want.\n\n Our roots are in Sicily, and our home will always be in Sicilys"
mafia.8.a:0 "Our Stronghold."

mafia.9.t:0 "The Entente Denounces us!"
mafia.9.d:0 "Despite the fact that the Entente is friendlier to us than the old Socialist Republic that was once on our soil, they still are far from our friends. And now, they are anything but, as the French Government in Algiers has officially denounced us and placed our nation under embargo. This would seriously hinder our ability to do business, however we can easily outrun their blockade or simply use other routes. However, a suggestion to get this embargo lifted is to make an offer to the Entente. This offer would allow the Entente forces to use the Isle of Sardinia as a launching pad to reclaim Europe, something that the Entente would surely accept given their position. "
mafia.9.a:0 "Bastards."
mafia.9.b:0 "Perhaps we could come to an understanding."

mafia.10.t:0 "All at a Price..."
mafia.10.d:0 "Luxury is something that has always been associated with Italian goods. When the wealthy look for quality, they turn to Italy, no matter the product. And of course, the Mafia helps with that. Any imaginable good can be found in our lands, and if it exists then we can typically make it better than anyone else can. From narcotics to cars to fashion to wine, Italy makes it better than anyone else. \n\n Of course, some of our products are more addictive than others. The elite classes across the world have gotten hooked on our drugs and have bankrupted themselves in the process. Of course, we all know what happens to people who don’t pay. "
mafia.10.a:0 "Better pay up."

mafia.11.t:0 "Our Contracts"
mafia.11.d:0 "Another industry the Mafia is spreading its roots in is construction. These front construction companies are gaining lucrative contracts both at home and abroad through no legitimate means. However, with our construction forces being stretched, the question is beginning to arise. Should we focus our efforts on projects at home or gain more contracts abroad. "
mafia.11.a:0 "Focus on Home."
mafia.11.b:0 "Focus on Abroad."

mafia.12.t:0 "High-Profile Assasinations"
mafia.12.d:0 "Major opponents of the Mafia have a tendency of ending up dead, this is just as true as ever. High-profile opponents of the Mafia have faced assassination through many means, such as car bombings, sniper attacks, simple attacks, abductions and many more means. While the government claims that these are nothing but accidents, most people know the truth that these assassinations are the work of the Mafia. Of course, that is the price of opposing our will. "
mafia.12.a:0 "Nothing but Accidents."

mafia.13.t:0 "An offer from the Mob"
mafia.13.d:0 "After the embargo against the Mafioso state in Southern Italy, the majority of our government expected the usual threats of retaliation. However, the Mafia has sent no threats, and instead has sent an offer. This offer would allow us military access to Sardinia if the embargo is lifted. While this offer is tempting, many ponder if it is worth giving the Mafia free reign over the Mediterranean. "
mafia.13.a:0 "Accept."
mafia.13.b:0 "Not a chance."

mafia.14.t:0 "The Illicit State"
mafia.14.d:0 "Cloaked in the shadows Southern Italy lies. As corrupt and seedy as the day is long, the Naples-Sicily region prospers in untold wealth, the Mafia controlling every facet of life. Corruption is engrained in the state, Protection Rackets are as accepted as taxes, and the government freely sells narcotics to its own citizens; fueling an addiction that only lines the pockets of corrupt commissars and bureaucrats. The Black Market and the legal economy have moulded into one, and Italy has become a world hub of less than legitimate business. \n\n In untold wealth Italy prospers, with morality and the law holding no place in the affairs of the state."
mafia.14.a:0 "Wonderful."

mafia.15.t:0 "An Invitation from the Axis of Bosses"
mafia.15.d:0 "The head of the Axis of Bosses has sent a delegation to our operation seeking to discuss a promising arrangement. The Don’s associates offer a spot in the secretive and shadowy Axis of Bosses, an international cabal of crime bosses and slumlords that seek to cooperate in order to benefit our shared dubious business. Side by side, we could stay out of each other's operations as we seek to expand in a united fashion, bringing greater honor and profit to our gangs, though we would have some competition that we could not just simply wipe away as before. Divided, we may fall to law enforcement and forces of order and so-called justice, but together, we may just be able to survive this turbulent time on a wave of profit and opportunity. What is our answer?"
mafia.15.a:0 "We open our arms to this Boss of Bosses."
mafia.15.b:0 "Our enterprise stands alone. We have no need to weaken our own syndicate."

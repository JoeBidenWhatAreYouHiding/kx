LBA_White_Peace_Cyrenaican_Revolt_desc:0 "The masks have finally fallen off as the final confrontation between the Porte and the Senussi Order is finally upon us.

LBA_Pacify_Tripolitania:0 "Pacify Tripolitania"
LBA_Pacify_Tripolitania_desc:0 "Sectarian issues, tribal conflict and republican thought are running rampant in Tripolitania causing the entire province to be plunged into a state of seemingly never ending chaos.

LBA_Form_Ifriqiya:0 "Form Ifriqiya"
LBA_Form_Ifriqiya_desc:0 "For centuries, the Lordship of Africa has been vacant. Our lands have been pawns in the chessboard of the great Turk, little resembling the land that brought so much advancement and wealth to the world in its Golden Age. But, under our leadership, what was has come again; and now finally Ifriqya is under its rightful ruler, King Idris I!"

LBA_Move_Capital_Tripoli_desc:0 "The strongest and most populated city in Libya, Tripoli is the heart of Tripolitania and an extremely influential player within Libyan politics.

LBA_Weapon_Smuggling_dc:0 "Masters of the Trans-Saharan Trade"
LBA_Weapon_Smuggling_dc_desc:0 "Whilst Libya controls no real economic value to speak of, with arable land at less than 5% of its total territory, it plays a pivotal role in the Trans-Saharan trade network. Oases in Fezzan and Cyrenaica provide the necessities for the long trips to the Sahel whilst cities and towns along the Tripolitanian Coast guide traffic between Egypt and the Western Maghreb.\n\nThe arrival of European powers and the failure of the Ottomans to intervene pro-actively in their Arab territories however has greatly damaged these routes that form the lifeblood of our society. French colonists in the West closed their borders to our traders whilst punitive expeditions were fought out between the Senussis and the French garrisons in Chad and Niger.\n\nThe collapse of the French state and the subsequent British revolution would revitalise the network as interest to dismantle the remaining French colonies has risen dramatically whilst further South, the German state of Mittelafrika is a welcome supplier for smuggling and a happy recipient for black market arms deals.\n\n§gRewards will be based on distance travelled or on modifiers unlocked through the focus tree.\n\n§YAvailable Routes§!:\n§OBenghazi§! - [LBA.cyr_siwa]\n§OBenghazi§! - §OKufra§! - [LBA.cyr_murzuq] - [LBA.cyr_tuat]\n§OBenghazi§! - §OKufra§! - [LBA.cyr_murzuq] - [LBA.cyr_bilma] - [LBA.cyr_timbuktu]\n§OBenghazi§! - §OKufra§! - [LBA.cyr_wadai] - [LBA.cyr_nigeria]\n§OBenghazi§! - §OKufra§! - [LBA.cyr_wadai] - [LBA.cyr_cameroon]\n§OBenghazi§! - §OKufra§! - [LBA.cyr_wadai] - [LBA.cyr_congo]"

### Focuses ###
cyrenaica_focus:0 "Cyrenaica Focus Tree"

LBA_army:0 "Military of the Order"
LBA_army_desc:0 "The Senussi Order fought bravely, fought together, and still they lost to Italy on the battlefield. While concessions were made at the peace table, our defeats highlighted weaknesses that could yet be exploited by our foes, particularly in the event of pitched warfare."
LBA_equipments_tactics:0 "Revised Infantry Doctrine"
LBA_equipments_tactics_desc:0 "In Bedouin tradition, the horse and camel are the chief components of the army and are merely accompanied by the infantry if the situation requires it. Our experience in the Weltkrieg has however shown the weakness of the strategy and the severe underperformance of our infantry during the Egyptian offensive. We need a regular infantry core if we are to maintain our independence."
LBA_guns_butter:0 "Rifle Acquisition"
LBA_guns_butter_desc:0 "Improving the quality of the weapons our soldiers use is a fundamental priority of national defence; however, our current lack of native industrial capacity complicates matters. We must ensure that we have the best possible handguns in our possession."
LBA_trucks:0 "Motorised Warfare"
LBA_trucks_desc:0 "Our homeland is defined by its geography, and the ability to quickly outmanoeuvre enemies through mountains and deserts is key to victory in modern warfare; however, infantry is often too slow to catch up to our horsemen. But in this new age of warfare, perhaps they will be to fast for the horses?"
LBA_bedouins:0 "Horsemen of Cyrenaica"
LBA_bedouins_desc:0 "The Senoussi Order and the men that fought for it have always used the loyal steeds of these lands to protect us. For centuries the horsemen of the nation have answered the call to war, and as a new age of war approaches, they shall do so again. They may now be equipped differently in arms, but not in spirit and bravery."
LBA_planning:0 "Planned Offensives"
LBA_planning_desc:0 "We must face the realities of being a minor nation stuck between opposing spheres of influence; whether we like it or not, war will come to our shores. The choice stands between properly planning for it, or leaving our destiny in the hands of fate."
LBA_fast_move:0 "Desert Mobility"
LBA_fast_move_desc:0 "Our main advantage in the Weltkrieg against the Italians was our capacity to to outmanoeuvre the Empire's forces, thanks to the ingenuity of our men and our knowledge of our lands. Our forces are always one step ahead of invaders, and pitched battle not always is the answer to our struggle."
LBA_seting_up_perimiters:0 "Organise the 'Adwar"
LBA_seting_up_perimiters_desc:0 "The Senoussi's struggle for the defence of our home was long and bloody. With no hope of support, we valiantly stood against the steel of the empire of the Italians, but not with brute force, rather, with mastery of the battlefield and the terrain of our homeland. Set up by Umar, the 'Adwar are local defence organisations which will respond to a central command in Jaghbub led by Umar and his closest allies."
LBA_desert_warfare:0 "Legacy of the Italo-Turkish War"
LBA_desert_warfare_desc:0 "When the Roman Imperialists stormed the beaches of Tripolitania, we fought side by side with our Turkish allies to cleanse the land of their kind and preserve the supremacy of the crescent in Libya. The Turks would later abandon us but the Senussi never gave up! We will fight the imperialists on the shores, we will fight them in the mountains and we will fight them in the deserts! Allahu Akbar! "
LBA_equipments_needs:0 "Tripoli-Ajdabiya Arms Route"
LBA_equipments_needs_desc:0 "The fighting capacity of an army can only go as far as their weaponry. Not only do our men have a lack of guns, but we lack proper, modern artillery pieces, machine guns and many other instruments of war that will undoubtedly be necessary in the coming storm. Tripoli serves as the main import harbour of Libya and is the only reliable source of foreign equipment. We should strengthen our connection to its markets."
LBA_improvisation:0 "Equipment Improvisation"
LBA_improvisation_desc:0 "Sometimes a few corners have to be cut. We don't need the best wood, or the best steel, or the best gunpowder... we need our men ready for combat and martyrdom for the homeland!"
LBA_military_fact:0 "Military Production"
LBA_military_fact_desc:0 "We currently lack the structures necessary for a proper arsenal, one that will truly make the weapons we need in the needed time frame. And time is of the essence, as war approaches our land ever rapidly."
LBA_dockyardo:0 "Found the Benghazi Dockyards"
LBA_dockyardo_desc:0 "In order to defend our shores properly, the Port of Benghazi will be outfitted with the best equipment our coffers can afford, to ensure its dry dock produces cargo and military craft to suit our needs."

LBA_Derna_Harbour:0 "Expand Derna Harbour"
LBA_Derna_Harbour_desc:0 "Our reliance on the port of Benghazi has led to a substantial decrease in revenue for the state as this way the Ottoman state has been able to profit from our hard work. Further East however, lays the quiet town of Derna which despite its smaller size doesn't suffer from the meddling of the Porte. By expanding its harbour, we may be able to steer traffic out of Benghazi."
LBA_Jebel_Irrigation:0 "Jebel Akhdar Irrigation Works"
LBA_Jebel_Irrigation_desc:0 "Lacking any form of manufacturing industry, the agricultural output of the Jebel Akhdar is the only tool our economy has. In the past, this region has however been incapable of ensuring a steady surplus for export and made the Cyrenaican economy almost entirely reliant on the weather during a given year. Irrigation works are as such a much needed necessity if we are to increase our revenues."
LBA_Saharan_Trade:0 "Trans-Saharan Trading"
LBA_Saharan_Trade_desc:0 "The second pillar of the Senussi economy next to agriculture, the trans-saharan trade is a vital source of income and influence for the Order. Lacking roads and travelling through hazardous lands, the Senussi provide protection to the caravans attempting the perilous journey."
LBA_Egyptian_Connection:0 "Connecting to Egypt"
LBA_Egyptian_Connection_desc:0 "With control over most of the sea trade in the hands of the Turks, the importance of the land routes connecting to Egypt has increased over the last few decades. Siwa forms the main stop on this connection as the proximity of the Oasis town to our religious capital in Jaghbub ensures a reliable and well-trodden path."
LBA_Local_Manufacturing:0 "Boost Local Manufacturing"
LBA_Local_Manufacturing_desc:0 "Lacking almost any form of local manufacturing or industry, we are overly reliant on trade with the Ottomans in Benghazi and the Egyptians in Siwa. To remedy this, the Zawiya (Sufi Lodges) will be tasked with setting up small facilities to weave textiles and process raw agricultural produce."
LBA_Zawiya_Education:0 "Zawiya Education Program"
LBA_Zawiya_Education_desc:0 "The Zawiyas form the centerpoint of our government in Cyrenaica and include religious facilities, accomodation for caravans and refugees and a storehouse for supplies and caravan goods. On top of this however, they have a task as places of education and teach children about the Senussi way. We should expand this education with practical material concerning lifestock, farming and warfare."
LBA_Weapon_Smuggling:0 "Masters of the Arms Trade"
LBA_Weapon_Smuggling_desc:0 "From the markets of Northern Chad to the oases of Fezzan, we have built ourselves up to be the dominant player in the Saharan arms trade supplying to bedouin and anti-colonial rebels alike. This has furthermore also ensured that the bannermen of the Senussi are armed to the teeth, ready to ride out for the defence of their faith if called upon by their leader."

LBA_idris_the_liberator:0 "The Return of Idris"
LBA_idris_the_liberator_desc:0 "Idris has returned from his exile! Rejoice, for a new age beckons!"
LBA_reborn_spirit:0 "Client-Patronage System"
LBA_reborn_spirit_desc:0 "The Senussi order is built on a rigorous socio-economic network that we must protect at all costs for it defines what we are. Nonetheless we can't remain ignorant from external developments and we must recognise that ties with the urban centers are becoming more and more important by the day."
LBA_Prepare_Defences:0 "Fortify Jaghbub and Jebel Akhdar"
LBA_Prepare_Defences_desc:0 "We are outnumbered, outgunned and completely under-equipped but every man and woman knows his duty to the Order and it is with their collective efforts that we will"
LBA_join_egypt:0 "Support the Arab Cause"
LBA_join_egypt_desc:0 "Whilst the people of Cyrenaica care little about such futilities as nationalism and ethnicity, we support the right of other Arabs to assert their independence from the outdated Ottoman state."
LBA_foreign_experts:0 "Attract Arab Capital"
LBA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "As Cyrenaica lacks any sort of industrialists and/or major capitalists, we will need foreign investment if we are to ever expand the economy. Processing foodstuff, shipbuilding and other industry could potentially be kickstarted on a small scale with the assistance of the Egyptians."
LBA_intel_equip_sharing:0 "Invite Egyptian Military Mission"
LBA_intel_equip_sharing_desc:0 "The Cyrenaican army is nothing but the soldiers produced by the Ikhwan and whilst they have proven their mettle against the Italians, we were defeated by the French in Chad and the English in Egypt who used modern tactics and discipline. If we are to preserve our sovereignty, we will need to expand our army to be more than just guerillas."
LBA_anti_imperial_rhetoric:0 "Cyrenaica for the Cyrenaicans"
LBA_anti_imperial_rhetoric_desc:0 "Turks, Italians and other foreigners have long oppressed the people of Cyrenaica, leaving them in poverty and misery as a third rate province within their grand empires. No more! By the will of Allah, master of the universe, we will assert our independence and lead the tribes of Cyrenaica to the future they deserve."
LBA_tribal_burden:0 "Redistribute Tribal Burdens"
LBA_tribal_burden_desc:0 "The entire state structure of the Senussi is built on the shoulders of the Cyrenaican tribes and it is the duty of our Leader that he shifts the burden amongst his follwers to ensure an equal distribution. Coordinating with the lodges, we will renegotiate our tribal taxes and conscription based on their capacities."

LBA_loyalty_own_reward:0 "The Cyrenaican Revolution"
LBA_loyalty_own_reward_desc:0 "Not only has Idris betrayed the Order when he made a cowardly deal with the Anglo devils but the consistent plundering of the Senussi treasury by the Princes have shown that they can not be trusted. The faithful have to stand united, not succumb to decadence and self-enrichement!"
LBA_Confiscate_Royal_Assets:0 "Confiscate Royal Properties"
LBA_Confiscate_Royal_Assets_desc:0 "More than willing to betray the legacy of the Great Senussi, his descendents have shown themselves to be untrustworthy snakes perfectly happy to take money in exchange for their loyalty. We don't need their kind in our Cyrenaica!"
LBA_Rally_Tribes:0 "Secure Tribal Loyalty"
LBA_Rally_Tribes_desc:0 "Whilst the prestige of our esteemed leader has ensured the loyalty of almost all tribes sworn to the Senussi state, we must make sure that they won't be open to overtures from the exiled Senussi princes and as such compromise our flanks."
LBA_make_it_double:0 "Fortify the 'Adwar"
LBA_make_it_double_desc:0 "To ensure the security of our domain and protect it from external threats, we must reinforce our 'Adwar and enforce quotas on the tribes serving underneath them. Every tribe will vow to keep his duwr supplied with food and figthers depending on its need and will replace the fallen if they are to fall in battle."
LBA_joint_war_efforts:0 "Brave Mujahideen of Cyrenaica"
LBA_joint_war_efforts_desc:0 "Every man is sworn to fight for Allah and push out the infidels that want to oppress us. The Zawiyas teach them how to fight, the caravans supply them with weapons and the scripture commands!"
LBA_Cooperate_Caliph:0 "Co-operate with the Caliph"
LBA_Cooperate_Caliph_desc:0 "Whilst severly disgraced by his secular administration, the Turkish Caliph is still the leader of the Ummah and represents the forefront of the fight against European aggression. It would be unwise to challenge the power of the Porte or attempt to bring down this protection from the infidel Frenchmen in Tunis."
LBA_Turkish_Military_Assistance:0 "Turkish Military Assistance"
LBA_Turkish_Military_Assistance_desc:0 "Our army may be the master of the Green Mountain and the Cyrenaican deserts but we lack the modern training and equipment of the Porte. If we are to be the vanguard of decolonisation on the Maghrebi flank, we will need to verse ourselves in the new ways of warfare." 
LBA_Maghrebi_Jihad:0 "Jihad against Imperialism"
LBA_Maghrebi_Jihad_desc:0 "The poor peoples living under the booth of the despicable Frenchmen have suffered long enough. With their forces entangled in a vicious struggle to restore their metropolitan holdings, the time has come for the Muslims to free themselves. Allahu Akbar!"
LBA_Unite_Libya:0 "Unite Libya"
LBA_Unite_Libya_desc:0 "The Turks have betrayed the faith, falling into the pitfalls of secularisation and cooperation with the infidels of the European continent. It is up to the Senussi to take up the mantle and free the Maghreb from the shackles of colonialism"
LBA_Cyrenaican_Egyptian_Cooperation:0 "Cyrenaican-Egyptian Cooperation"
LBA_Cyrenaican_Egyptian_Cooperation_desc:0 "Linked through the oasis of Siwa and the caravan routes leading East, we will strengthen our ties with the government in Cairo to ensure the necessary support for our Jihad against the treacherours infidel dogs."

### Events ###
libya.1.t:0 "The Emirate of Cyrenaica"
libya.1.d:0 "Founded by the great Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi in 1843, the Senussi Order has become a synonym for the region of Cyrenaica in which it holds sway. Although we are technically a part of the Ottoman Empire and penetration of the Green Mountain by the urban elite of Benghazi is steadily growing, we have been able to maintain our independence for close to 100 years now. Fighting the despicable imperialists at every turn, the previous grandmasters have led the charge against the Europeans from the deserts of Wadai to the Oasis of Siwa. When the Italian army invaded Tripolitania in 1911, we fought side by side with our Caliph to rebuke their formidable force and continued doing so when the Turks handed Libya over only a few months later. Our relation with the Turks has always been...complicated to say the least as whilst we joined forces in 1911 and 1915, it is abundantly clear that the Porte isn't too keen on an independent administrative body within its domain. Nonetheless when the Weltkrieg ended in an Ottoman victory, the overstretched and bankrupt empire was forced to concede that it didn't have the means to contest our strengthened post-war status and contended itself with the return of nominal control exercised from its bureaucrats in Benghazi.\n\nSince the end of the war, little has happened in Cyrenaica as the lack of both means and will to change the status-quo prevents any substanial changes. This was to change slightly in 1933 when our supreme leader, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, died of old age leaving his son to take up the reins. The death of this pivotal figure in our history however has reignited tensions between the pan-islamic supporters of the late grandmaster and the Senussi Princes looking to the rightful heir, Idris, who went into exile after the Ottoman victory."
libya.1.a:0 "Onwards!"

libya.2.t:0 "[LBA.GetLeader] Incapacitated"
libya.2.d:0 "Personally leading the charge against forces loyal to the French State in Northern Chad, our Supreme Leader has suffered a serious blow to the head after his horse was shot from under him. Whilst it is currently unclear whether this will have lasting effects on his health, aggrevated due to the complete lack of medical personel in our state, this has emboldened the Idrisi loyalists to call for a vote amongst the Senussi Princes concerning the return of the legitimate heir from his exile in Egypt.\n\nThey are however receiving serious opposition from close friends and commanders of the previous supreme leader, seeing this as nothing but a powergrab by the Princes to enlarge their own influence and push out the last of the loyal pan-islamists. Led by Umar al-Mukthar, esteemed war hero of both the Chadian and Italo-Turkish wars, this clique may pose an issue to the Princes if not dealt with adequatly."
libya.2.a:0 "Tumultous times are upon us"

libya.3.t:0 "Idris Speaks at the Third Arab Congress"
libya.3.d:0 "Trying to gather foreign support for his claim on the Cyrenaican Emirate, Idris has used the Egyptian Arab Congress to sway the opinion of the gathered Arab notables and politicians. A prince of the Senussi family as well and strong supporter of Idris, Sayyid Hilal al-Sanusi of Jaghbub also went to the Egyptian capital, likely to discuss a way for Idris to retake the throne in his homeland. Although Egypt is likely to grant its support to the exiled prince, most eyes are turned towards Benghazi where the representatives of the Caliph are reporting the unfolding regency crisis to the Ottoman government in Konstantiniyye."
libya.3.a:0 "Those foreigners have no business in internal affairs!"

libya.4.t:0 "Scheming in Benghazi"
libya.4.d:0 "Seemingly making it their mission to restore Idris to the throne of Cyrenaica, Egypt has through connections within the Benghazi business community started to buy the support of various tribal leaders and the uncertain Senussi Princes. Their efforts will be in vain however if they can't persuade the aging Umar al-Mukhtar who remains steadfast in his support for the incapacitated az-Zubayr. To tackle this 'issue', shadier proposals to tip the balance in favour of Idris have been proposed, including the termination of al-Mukhtars life through means of poison.\n\nIf the plot were to fail however, this can backfire badly as the network of allies maintained by al-Mukhtar is likely to retaliate against such a despicable act of treachery."
libya.4.a:0 "The plot succeeds!"
libya.4.b:0 "al-Mukthar escapes death"

libya.5.t:0 "Death of al-Mukhtar"
libya.5.d:0 "That death would arrive in due time for the aging al-Mukhtar was undoubtedly true but many were still arrived by the speed at which his health deteriorated these last few days. Prominent commander of the Senussi forces and respected by all, his death comes as a heavy blow in these uncertain times and the ceremony in Ajdabiya attracted a crowd of thousands wishing to wave their hero a final goodbye. Prince Osman Fuad, leader of the Turkish forces in Libya during the Weltkrieg, was quick to send a letter to our government praising his friend and compatriot whilst in Konstantiniyye the Chamber of Deputies showered his valiant deeds during the war with the highest praise.\n\nWith the death of the most prominent defender of the sickly al-Zubayr, it seems unlikely anyone will stand in the way of a return to power by Idris. Some stragglers in the opposition remain however, pointing out how odd the sudden death of their leader was and accusing the supporters of Idris of poisoning. As Muslim tradition however forbids delayed funerals, they have no way to acquire proof of this supposed plot."
libya.5.a:0 "All of Cyrenaica salutes its hero!"

libya.6.t:0 "Assassination Attempt on al-Mukhtar"
libya.6.d:0 "Unrest is spreading through all of Cyrenaica as a plot to assassinate Umar al-Mukhtar was uncovered by close associates of the old guerilla fighter. Outraged by this attack on his person and explicitly offended due to the choice of weapon, poison, for its cowardness, the commander has openly attacked the Senussi princes for their scheming and despicable actions. It is no secret that al-Mukhtar didn't hold a high opinion of the Princes, who he saw as having betrayed the values of the Senussi in exchange for earthly posessions. Whether this attack will have rammifications is as of yet unclear but if Mukhtar seeks to enact revenge, the Princes may soon find themselves under severe fire."
libya.6.a:0 "An outrageous affair!"

libya.7.t:0 "Sayyid ‘Abid al-Sanusi Invites Idris to Kufra"
libya.7.d:0 "With all serious opposition to the Idrisian loyalists dealt with, Sayyid ‘Abid al-Sanusi of Kufra has sent word to Cairo calling for the return of the legitimate heir. Idris was quick to respond to the request and arrived in Kufra with his honour guard to officially ascend the Cyrenaican throne. Hundreds of Cyrenaicans in Kufra flocked to the streets to watch their Emir arrive but it is unclear if this enthusiasm is shared by the citizens of the Green Mountain and the Murabtin Masamir tribe."
libya.7.a:0 "Long live the Supreme Leader!"

libya.8.t:0 "Civil War in Cyrenaica"
libya.8.d:0 "Outraged by the assassination attempt of al-Mukhtar, the tribal alliance that composes the Senussi state has fallen apart with former allies drawing swords to right wrongs. Umar al-Mukhtar himself hasn't called for any punitive actions and has even openly called those acting in his name to stand down and prevent further bloodshed amongst brothers but the dice have been rolled and there seems to be no immediate end to the figthing.\n\nThe situation is looking bleak for the Idrisi supporters as their cowardly act has shocked the bedouin to their core as honesty and honour are pivotal for their way of life. The increasing decadence and passivity of the Princes had been deteriorating relations between the action-oriented middle commanders of the Order and the Princes themselves, which now prompted a violent outburst of these cropped up feelings."
libya.8.a:0 "May Allah ensure a swift end to the fighting!"

libya.9.t:0 "Defeat of the Senussi Princes"
libya.9.d:0 "The inter-tribal conflict, caused by the assassination attempt on Umar al-Mukhtar, has reached its violent conclusion today as a final attack on the religious capital of Jaghbub was prevented when the last remaining Prince, Sayyid Hilal al-Sanusi, decided to flee instead of putting up a last stand. With is departure, the followers of al-Zubayr have declared themselves victorious. The Supreme Leader however seems unlikely to recover as the blow he received months ago still hasn't healed fully, leaving him to the mercy of his regency council.\n\nTo solve the question of leadership, the council has decided to disband itself and proclaim Umar al-Mukhtar as the official regent of the Emir. Whilst he initially refused to accept the offer, citing his old age and his own deteriorating health, he was ultimately convinced by his two close friends al-Fadil Bu-‘Umar and Yusuf Bu-Rahil."
libya.9.a:0 "May he maintain the peace in our lands!"

libya.10.t:0 "Anniversary of the Treaty of Rome"
libya.10.d:0 "Just a short twenty years ago, our struggle against the colonising oppressors ended in victory, as German and Austrian forces forced Italy to its knees. Celebrations for the anniversary are set to happen today in major cities, as we recall not only what we were, but what we could be!"
libya.10.a:0 "A Grand Day!"

libya.11.t:0 "The War of Independence Has Begun!"
libya.11.d:0 "To Arms! As Libya prepares itself for the inevitable counter-attack from Turkish forces, our people rally behind our cause like never before. Even men from abroad, including many from Tunisia, have come to join our liberation struggle, albeit we are unable to determine if the are acting on the behalf of the Bey of Tunis, the French, or themselves."
libya.11.a:0 "March! To Victory!"

libya.12.t:0 "Anti-Imperialist Rhetoric"
libya.12.d:0 "Each day, more and more people here and abroad support our speeches against colonialism and imperialism. It will not be long before we have even syndicalists and republicans aiding our efforts in freeing Africa, for all see the folly and greed of the French and Germans."
libya.12.a:0 "Onwards!"

libya.13.t:0 "What About the French Attack on Morocco?"
libya.13.d:0 "Morocco, disconnected from other Cairo allies, will need every help it can get in the coming struggle! We should send aid in men and weapons to help it reach victory!"
libya.13.a:0 "It's an ally we can't afford to lose."
libya.13.b:0 "It is rash to deal in such absolute conclusions."

libya.14.t:0 "Libyan Aid Arrives!"
libya.14.d:0 "Our friends in Libya have sent us supplies and some men to aid in the war against the perfidious French invaders!"
libya.14.a:0 "Huzzah!"

libya.15.t:0 "Conflict in the Jabal"
libya.15.d:0 "Trouble has been brewing between two of the largest Cyrenaican tribes as the Sa'adi tribes of the Bra'sa and 'Awagir have found themselves at odds over a matter of land distribution. The 'Awagir, larger than their counterpart have seen a recent increase in population due to some fortunate harvests and have started pushing into Bra'sa territory to feed their extra mouths. Evidently this has angered the Bra'sa who have sent a call to arms to their Murabtin fighters as a show of force and to deter further aggression.\n\nShots have already been fired between the two sides but thusfar no casualties have been reported. The whole situation is a rather unfortunate situation for the Senussi Order as it seems impossible to please both sides."
libya.15.a:0 "Assist the Bra'sa, it's their land!"
libya.15.b:0 "Assist the 'Awagir, we can't lose their support!"

libya.16.t:0 "Border Friction in Western Egypt"
libya.16.d:0 "After an unfortunate incident between an 'Abyadat trader and a Jwazi tribesman, it seems like the relations between the Cyrenaican and Western Egyptian tribes are once more coming to a head. As a retaliation for the supposed offence against the honour of the 'Aybadat tribe, a raid was launched by their Murabtin laying claim to at least a dozen sheep and plundering an outpost near the border. Worrying the Egyptian representatives in Siwa, they have demanded an answer to the issue and are calling on us to put an end to the fighting or they will take measures against our activities in the oasis town."
libya.16.a:0 "Compensate the Jwazi for their losses"
libya.16.b:0 "Punish the 'Abyadat"
libya.16.c:0 "This does not concern us"

libya.17.t:0 "Slavery on the Central African Route"
libya.17.d:0 "Despite the best attempts of the colonial and Ottoman powers to outlaw slavery and fight its widespread use in the Maghreb, the incapacity of the Ottoman government to extend authority over the Libyan interior have caused a revitalising of the ancient trade routes linking the Sahel to the Maghreb. Mainly coming through Chad and Sudan, the oasis town of Kufra has started to develop itself as the capital of the trade seeing frequent visits from caravans and organising auctions to send their 'produce' all across the Maghreb.\n\nCalls from abroad to solve the issue have been rising steadily however and representatives of the Porte have been grilled severly over their inability to put an end to such inhumane practices. Nonetheless it seems unlikely that the trade will halt anytime soon as it provides a vital source of income for the Order and has enabled it to expand their influence as South as Mittelafrika."
libya.17.a:0 "It is as it is"

libya.18.t:0 "The Ottoman Economic Recession"
libya.18.d:0 "Caused by the market crash in the German Empire, the internal market of the Ottoman Empire has suffered substantial blows as demand for agricultural produce in Europe, the main export, has collapsed.\n\nRipples of this crisis have moved to the Green Mountain of Cyrenaica where farmers have seen a decrease in prices for their wares on the markets of Benghazi. As our exports in and of itself are fairly neglible and only possible in excellent harvest years, the overal economy hasn't been hit too hard but there are fears amongst the traders that this could soon herald in a collapse of the caravan trade."
libya.18.a:0 "Most unfortunate"

libya.19.t:0 "Great Summit of the Cyrenaican Tribes"
libya.19.d:0 "As has been done a few decades ago, our great leader has called for a gathering of all the Cyrenaican tribes both inside of our domain and the Western Egyptian desert. Even though most feuds and issues between the two groups were solved back then, a recent increase in disputes has prompted us to once more gather the tribes and reaffirm the bonds of friendship and support.\n\nAssembled in Jaghbub, the gathering went ahead with little issues and all representatives were able to return to their homes content with the solutions hashed out. Although there were calls from amongst the Senussi leadership to make the gathering a more common event, this was rebuked by the tribes themselves as fears of centralisation once more rose to prominence."
libya.19.a:0 "The bonds of cooperation strengthen us all!"

libya.20.t:0 "French Attack Zawiya"
libya.20.d:0 "In a brazen move, aimed at stopping our influence amongst their subjects the French army has sent a detachement deep into the Sahara to raid our oases. Supported with modern rifles and air support, our Ikhwan stood no chance at stopping them but we were able to harass the French columns before retreating back into the deserts."
libya.20.a:0 "We live to fight another day!"

libya.21.t:0 "Caravan Lost"
libya.21.d:0 "Disaster has struck in the Sahara as a whole caravan has seemingly disappeared amidst its mighty dunes. Scheduled to arrive last week at the next stop on the route, the caravan of at least a hundred camels never showed up and has left merchants at the trading post fearing for the worst.\n\nCarrying the riches of the dark continent, the economic loss is substantial and a number of the merchants have pleaded for aid at their local Zawiya in the hopes of covering their costs."
libya.21.a:0 "We shall burden the cost"
libya.21.b:0 "We can not help them"

libya.22.t:0 "Caravan Plundered"
libya.22.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to keep the Caravan safe, a group of raiders were able to defeat our protectors and have run of with the valuable goods carried by the caravan. Whilst this is a catastrophe for the traders along the route, it is also a great hit to our prestige as confidence in our capabilities to ensure the safety of the Trans-Saharan routes has gone down as a result."
libya.22.a:0 "Dammit!"

libya.23.t:0 "France Closes Down Operations in Timbuktu"
libya.23.d.lba:0 "In an effort to gain better control over their Southern belt, the government in Algeria has sent Senegalese Tirailleurs to the desert city in the hopes of expelling our influence.

libya.24.t:0 "The Search for Zerzura"
libya.24.d:0 "Rumoured to lay deep within the Libyan desert, the mythical oasis town of Zerzura has long enchanted European explorers. In writings dating back to the 13th century, the authors spoke of a city which was "white as a dove" and called it "The Oasis of Little Birds". In the Kitab al Kanuz, Zerzura is said to be a city in the Sahara full of treasure with a sleeping king and queen, guarded by black giants who keep anyone from going in and coming out.\n\nAn expedition to find this place was launched by the British Ralph Bagnold but the Egyptian revolution put a premature end to his endeavours. Nonetheless Weltkrieg veteran of the Austro-Hungarian army, László Almásy, remained entranced by the idea and has requested permission from the Ottoman government in Benghazi to embark on an expedition of his own."

libya.25.d:0 "The center of the Turkish community in Tripolitania and the de facto capital of the region since the end of the Weltkrieg, the fall of Misratah proved to be the final nail in the coffin of the Portes representatives in Libya. The expulsion of Ottoman forces has however opened serious questions into the future of our state as the three regions of Libya (Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica) differ greatly in their views on the future of the nation.\n\nFearful of the demographic and economic gravitas posed by Tripolitania, many in Fezzan are pushing for a federative government model in which they can retain their autonomy whilst in Cyrenaica many go even further. They believe that Cyrenaica and Tripolitania should not be united and that the two entities should remain independent of eachother, further affirming the status that was bestowed on the Emirate of Cyrenaica during the Weltkrieg. In Tripolitania the situation is even more complex. Whilst many support a union of the 3 constituent states that make up Libya, they denounce the federal model as they believe it creates a powerless government incapable of solving the many issues that plague Libya. Another large group there aligns more closely with the views held by the Cyrenaicans and fight against the unification of the region in general, believing that only a republican model is fit for Tripolitania which is in sharp contrast with the Cyrenaican theocracy."

libya.26.d:0 "Whilst Cyrenaica has been mostly spared of the folly that is party politics due to its strict theocratic structure, the region of Tripolitania has been far closer linked to the Ottoman center and has been especially susceptive to the changes induced by the Young Turk revolution in 1908 and the subsequent democratisation of the state. Liberals, conservatives, socialists and much more have had the time to develop themselves, laying the foundations for a modern Libyan Assembly.\n\nThis landscape has led to the creation of three main power blocs, mostly consisting of ex-Ottoman bureacrats and powerful urban families. The Nationalist Party, headed by Ahmad Faqih Hasan, has taken many cues from the Kemalist movement and pleads for a unitary Libyan state in which religion is removed from the political scene. They renounce the Senussis as an institution, seeing it as detrimental to the wellbeing of the nation but have little means to contest them. The National Congress, headed by Bashir al-Saadawi is their main opposition and symbolises a fragile union of Berber and Arab interests that is willing to cooperate with the Senussis for the betterment of Libya. They too favour a unitary state but they are willing to let that temporarily slide to ensure the stability of the nation. Lastly there is the Labour Party, headed by Bashir bin Hamza. They refuse any compromise with the Senussis who they see as a decadent, anti-Libyan institution. Whilst their membership is insignificant compared to the other two blocs, many are fearful of the capital the Internationale has granted the organisation and the influence of French and Italian activists in the Tripolitanian cities."

Creating political clubs, reading texts and tuning in to the radio broadcasts from Cairo, these youngsters are expressing their desires for the incorporation of Cyrenaica within a greater Arab state, ideally led from Cairo.\n\nMore disturbingly however, they are questioning the validity of the Sharia within modern society and are taking cues from both the Turks and the Egyptian Wafd concerning the secularisation of the state."

Our army, whilst not as modern or large as the two behemoths, could play a crucial role in the conflict and is a desired commodity for both sides.\n\nOpinion is divided in Cyrenaica though as going against the Caliph would in some ways be a betrayal of the Pan-Islamist ideals held so dear by our Order. On the other hand, many have seen in the steadily decreasing role of the Caliphate in Ottoman politics an irreversible trend towards secularisation and Turkish supremacy which poses a direct threat to our fledgling Emirate."

trp.1.t:0 "Tripolitania Pursues Closer Ties"
trp.1.d:0 "Unlike our other provinces in the Mashriq and Egypt, the people of Tripolitania never shared the same hatred for the late Ottoman government. Their distance to the capital and the loose policy of the Porte in the region led to a large degree of autonomy, although the formation of nationalist thought never really took off. Divided amongst sectarian and tribal lines, there is a certain adherence to a Tripolitanian idea but few dared see this out of the Ottoman whole.\n\nWith the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the former province finds itself in a difficult situation. Lacking the means to embark on state building and without the capital to create a self-sufficient economy, they have approached what remains of the Turkish Empire to embark on a program of mutual assistance, exchanging cultural ideas and strengthening the economic ties."

Boasting no industry to speak of, illiterate almost to the last man and offering very little resourcesm its geographical position could nonetheless prove essential in warding of any threat from the Pied Noirs.\n\nTo this end, observers from all across the Internationale have flocked down to Tripoli in the hopes of decisively pulling the nation into our alliance. Despite the boasting of their leader, Faqih Hasan, many in our own nations are doubting whether Tripoli wouldnt prove to be a liability rather than an asset, furthermore pointing out that the "socialist" ideals the FNB promotes can barely be called socialist."

The lack of genuine socialism in the nation is however causing trouble in the anti-colonial comittee as even though Hasans government strives for many similar programs like us such as secularism and support of Labour Unions, a radical transformation of society seems unlikely to occur."

Built on the tribal alliances of yonder, the United National Front promises a strong government with the greatest respect for the Faith whilst also standing unwaveringly in favour of the Arab cause.\n\nThirdly there is the city of Misrata, Tripolitania's largest city, whose unwavering loyalty to former Ottoman commander Ramadan al-Suwayhli poses a significant threat to the democratic notions of the other parties. As his influence over the remnants of the former Ottoman army remains significant and his prestige from the Weltkrieg is unquestioned by all Tripolitanians, many are fearful that he may install himself and his allies "for the greater good of Tripolitania"."

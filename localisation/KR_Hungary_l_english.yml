HUN_DH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Before 1914 the Kingdom of Hungary regarded itself as a Great Power in its own right, as it constituted one half of the powerful Habsburg Dual-Monarchy. Victory in the Weltkrieg bought the Kingdom territorial gains at the expense of Serbia and Romania, but not the dominant position in the East that the Hungarians expected. The upcoming Ausgleich negotiation should be the time when the whole of the Crownlands of St. Stephen will finally be restored to the Magyar nation. Meanwhille, a new strain of aggressive and expansionist nationalism has come to the fore of Hungarian politics, many of whom question the continued dominion of the Habsburg Emperor."

kr.hungary.3.t:0 "Hungary in 1936"
kr.hungary.3.d:0 "Before 1914 the Kingdom of Hungary regarded itself as a Great Power in its own right, as it constituted one half of the powerful Habsburg Dual-Monarchy. Victory in the Weltkrieg bought the Kingdom territorial gains at the expense of Serbia and Romania, but not the dominant position in the East that the Hungarians expected. While its agrarian economy has not fared well in the face of cheap grain from the new Eastern Kingdoms, the political troubles in Austria and weak Imperial authority under Emperor Karl have allowed the Magyars to follow a more independent line. The Hungarian Diet continues to debate funding for the Hungarian Honvédség, and a new strain of aggressive and expansionist nationalism, determined to 'Magyarise' the divided peoples of the Balkans, has come to the fore of Hungarian politics. While German meddling in 1927 prevented the Hungarians from cementing their dominant position in the Dual Monarchy, the next Ausgleich renegotiation should be the time when the whole of the Crown Lands of St. Stephen will finally be restored to the Magyar nation."
kr.hungary.3.a:0 "We should hope so!"

kr.hungary.4.t:0 "Domestic Politics"
kr.hungary.4.d:0 "In the time since the Weltkrieg and the Second Compromise of 1927, Hungary has seen its independence and influence diminish. Closer than ever before to the junior partner status it enjoyed following the Revolutions of 1848, many Magyars chafe at the sundering of the Crownlands of St. Stephen and the creation of the false kingdom of “Illyria.”\n\n However, Hungary still enjoys relatively free elections (so long as Syndicalists are not involved), and parties which oppose the Compromise and Austrian dominance of the Dual-Monarchy can stand and win seats in the National Diet, with the consent of the Emperor. Three parties currently vie for supremacy. The country is currently governed by a coalition of conservative parties loyal to the Habsburg monarch. Most prominent is the National Constitution Party, led by István Bethlen, a renowned statesman and Hungarian patriot who works well with the Austrians despite his opposition to the results of the previous Ausgleich. Its main competitor is Mihály Károlyi’s Party of ’48, a national-liberal party which obliquely advocates for an independent Hungary and promises greater liberties to its people. Finally, there is the rising Social Democratic Party of Hungary, led by Árpád Szakasits, which has become popular due to large-scale social inequity in the country’s urban centers; especially Budapest."
kr.hungary.4.a:0 "Let's just keep things together..."

kr.hungary.5.t:0 "Hungarian Socialism"
kr.hungary.5.d:0 "Lack of work and lack of opportunity has pushed more and more Hungarians to support the Szakasits Program, but social democracy is not the only political which has seen its fortunes rise amongst Hungary’s urban working class. While orthodox Syndicalists and Radical Socialists were forced to flee the country following a series of purges by the Imperial Evidenzbureau, their literature and propaganda spreads through Hungary’s uncensored libraries, radical university movements, and gossip in coffee shops. The progenitor of the modern Hungarian socialist movement, Bela Kun, is famed for his exploits during the Russian Revolution and skill at evading German and Austrian military police. The Evidenzbureau has investigated many members of the Social Democrat Party of Hungary for suspected ties to Kun and his ilk, but have been unable to pin down any of the leaders for sedition or crimes against the state. For now, Kun waits in Paris, surrounded by his coterie of potential Hungarian revolutionaries, like Mátyás Rákosi and Tibor Szamuely."
kr.hungary.5.a:0 "Good riddance!"

kr.hungary.6.t:0 "Hungarian Nationalism"
kr.hungary.6.d:0 "The Christian National League, an establishment force endorsed by the Emperor, is Hungary’s most prominent right-wing political party, but this is not to say that Hungarian ultra-rightism is not influential. Magyar Nationalism is one of the nation’s most potent political forces, driving interest in a variety of groups with names invariably including some version of ‘Hungary’ and a variety of adjectives. The Party of Hungarian Life, the Christian National Socialist Front, the United Hungarian National Socialist Party, the National Front, the Party of National Will, the Smallholders’ Party, and the Hungarian National Socialist Agricultural Labourers’ and Workers’ Party, to name a few. \n\nNone of the country’s many right-wing parties are capable of working together, meaning they spend more time nipping at each others' heels than vying for electoral success. They disagree over religion, race, economic policy, and the ideal form of government, including the continueed existence of the Habsburg monarchy itself. The most influential brand of ultra-rightism is certainly that of Gyula Gömbös, Hungary’s most prominent nationalist politician, and his economic system of ‘National Socialism.’"
kr.hungary.6.a:0 "Trouble-makers and fools!"

kr.hungary.7.t:0 "The Hungarian Army"
kr.hungary.7.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the armed forces of the Dual-Monarchy of Austria-Hungary suffered some of the most humiliating defeats of the war, and its campaigns were repeatedly saved by the actions of the German army. The Austro-Hungarian army’s problems were many and diverse. Lack of funding, poorly trained officers, and a complicated command structure compounded every issue it faced. Perhaps most glaring was the fact that much of the army could not communicate, being recruited as it was from the many ethnic groups of the empire. This resulted in a default ‘Army Slavic’ being used in battle, a pidgin language mainly based on Czech that could function for basic orders. While the Hungarian National Diet has attempted to correct some of the problems afflicting the Hungarian Honvédség, the pacifism that set in following the Weltkrieg has resulted in a lack of political will for military funding."
kr.hungary.7.a:0 "Great..."

kr.hungary.8.t:0 "Black Monday"
kr.hungary.8.d:0 "The results in Germany were disastrous. In Austria, calamity. And now in Hungary? Catastrophe. Many of the largest employers in Budapest have suddenly shut their doors. The kronen has inflated beyond reckoning, and people are unable to afford food in the morning with what they were paid the day before. Farmers are hoarding grain, soldiers have left their posts, and urban centers are beginning to fill with people looking for work, food, or both. Unfortunately, the Emperor and his government are concerned with Austria and the National Diet is bound by his decisions."
kr.hungary.8.a:0 "What are we to do?"

kr.hungary.9.t:0 "Widespread Unemployment"
kr.hungary.9.d:0 "In the wake of Black Monday, Hungarian unemployment rockets from 5% to 36%. The masses of the jobless roam the streets of Budapest and other major cities, begging for work and for food. Others steal their daily bread. Honest people stay in doors for fear of the dispossessed and what little charity exists is usually met with demands for more. And anger when more is not forthcoming. The Social Democrats lay the blame at the feet of the absent Emperor and his stooges in the National Diet who have refused to make the necessary reforms to help the less fortunate and repair the economy. Their proposals have been met with particular enthusiasm in Budapest."
kr.hungary.9.a:0 "This isn't good."

kr.hungary.10.t:0 "The Grain Crisis"
kr.hungary.10.d:0 "The fallout from Black Monday has reached Hungary’s agricultural sector. Grain prices plummeted and many farmers have reverted back to subsistence farming to survive. The resulting deflation has caused food shortages throughout the country and sent many city dwellers to the countryside either to look for work or rob the peasant farmers they believe are responsible for the crisis. Banditry is rife, as many police officers have stopped reporting for work following state-mandated slashes to the budget and suspended pay."
kr.hungary.10.a:0 "We just can't win."

kr.hungary.11.t:0 "Militias in the Countryside"
kr.hungary.11.d:0 "Units of the Hungarian Honvédség have independently deployed to the countryside to take the banditry problem into their own hands. The vast majority of peasant farmers and landowners have welcomed their involvement, despite the fact that said militias have a rather... unique idea of ‘law and order.’ Pleas from the National Diet to cease their extrajudicial functions have largely fallen on deaf ears. These soldiers show more loyalty to the Emperor and their local officers than they do to the National Diet."
kr.hungary.11.a:0 "Damn it all!"

kr.hungary.14.t:0 "The Hungarians Refuse!"
kr.hungary.14.d:0 "The unthinkable has occurred. The faces of the Emperor's friends and advisors are variably red or gaunt. They are loathe to deliver the terrible news. Finally, one of them speaks. In response to the instructions from His Imperial Majesty, the Hungarian National Diet has declared that the Dual-Monarchy is dead, they will no longer suffer 'abuse and humiliation' at the Augsleich, and that Hungary is now an independent Republic. This open rebellion has shattered the peace of Central Europe. The military is ready to put down these Magyar upstarts, but some of the Emperor's wiser counsels note that the Hungarian National Army actually outnumbers the Austrian Landwehr... While some will surely fight for the Emperor, the loyalty of most divisions is in question. They suggest delaying and seeking an accord with the Hungarians, lest we unleash the violence of 1848 with modern technology."
kr.hungary.14.a:0 "Damn the Hungarians. Let's talk this over."
kr.hungary.14.b:0 "We deal with this now."

kr.hungary.15.t:0 "The Austrian Parley"
kr.hungary.15.d:0 "It seems Hungarian independence has come as a shock to Vienna. The Emperor has proposed an armistice for the time being, though he has refused to recognize Hungary's independence and the German Kaiser has followed his lead. The Austrians wish to maintain Hungary within Habsburg dominion and are willing to negotiate rather than resort to violence, for the time being. It's probable the Austrians will use this time to mobilize their smaller military. It is also likely that if we maintain our independence, we will eventually come to blows."
kr.hungary.15.a:0 "An armistice for now."
kr.hungary.15.b:0 "Enough parley."

kr.hungary.16.t:0 "Austro-Hungarian Negotiations"
kr.hungary.16.d:0 "After much debate, it was agreed that Vienna shall be the site of negotiation and reconciliation between Hungary and Austria. High-ranking members of both the military and the National Diet attended the first meeting. The Ringstrasse was filled with cars and shouts in myriad languages. Starting off the event, the Archbishop of Vienna, Theodor Innitzer, blessed the court, praying that God may provide swift words and swifter reprieve. Afterwards, with every man accounted for, the negotiations began."
kr.hungary.16.a:0 "We need more than prayers."

kr.hungary.17.t:0 "Negotiations Heat Up"
kr.hungary.17.d:0 "Tensions are high for both the Austrian and Hungarian factions, with delegates often shouting aloud at each other over what is right and wrong. What is true and false. Oaths of loyalty to the Emperor or the Nation. Upon hearing that an Austrian platoon was stationed outside the building, a group of Hungarian officers launched accusations at the Austrian side that the Evidenzbureau meant to arrest the Magyar delegation, much to the dismay of the Hungarian diplomats. The Austrians claimed it was a simple matter of security against syndicalist saboteurs and anarchist terrorists. Ultimately, the platoon was sent away, and negotiations continued after some paranoid grumbling."
kr.hungary.17.a:0 "The Austrians are up to something."

kr.hungary.18.t:0 "Negotiations on Minorities"
kr.hungary.18.d:0 "The question of minorities is precisely what foiled the Ausgleich, and yet the Austrians dare bring it up again. It is true that Hungarians are a minority in many parts of Transleithania, where there can be found many Germans, Slovaks, Romanians, and Jews that live as citizens. The Emperor insists that these peoples should be granted greater rights within the country to avert nationalist revolts. They should be granted the same privileges as Hungarians. Naturally, conservative members of the delegation rejected this notion. They say it is ridiculous that Hungarians should treat minorities as if they are equals in Hungary. More conciliatory diplomats insist that a compromise must be reached with the Austrians if Hungary is to avoid war. However, even the liberal members of the delegation recognize this will not go over well with most Magyars, who have traditionally given their vote to nationalist parties."
kr.hungary.18.a:0 "Szocialisták..."

kr.hungary.19.t:0 "Negotiations Reach an Impasse"
kr.hungary.19.d:0 "Negotiations are beginning to break down between Austria and Hungary. The Emperor attended the most recent session of negotiations. At first, he merely watched and listened. When he finally did speak, he asked why the Hungarians should want independence and why did they deserve independence. The officers spoke of the Hungarian soldiers’ sacrifices in the First Weltkrieg. The diplomats cited the Hungarian peoples’ loyalty in the war and promised everlasting friendship between Austria and Hungary. The Emperor seemed bemused or unmoved. He questioned whether the other minority groups within Hungary had not made the same sacrifices. Peace is balanced on a knife's edge."
kr.hungary.19.a:0 "Isten segítsen minket."
kr.hungary.19.b:0 "We are His Majesty's loyal servants. (Rejoin Empire)"

kr.hungary.20.t:0 "War Comes"
kr.hungary.20.d:0 "For months, Austrians and Hungarians have tried to come to some sort of accord. Everything has failed. The Emperor's insistence on what he calls 'fair treatment' for the various ethnic groups of Transleithania would result in nothing less than the national dismemberment of Hungary and the reduction of the Magyar people in their own country. Much of the general staff continues to insist that this was simply a ploy by the Austrians to bide time and increase the size of their military in anticipation of an inevitable conflict."
kr.hungary.20.a:0 "The drums of war beat yet again."
kr.hungary.20.b:0 "We are His Majesty's loyal servants. (Rejoin Empire)"

kr.hungary.22.t:0 "Legitimists Protest Independence"
kr.hungary.22.d:0 "Many Hungarian aristocrats, clergyman, and military officers are vocally opposed to the new status quo in Hungary. Most of them are devout Roman Catholics and traditionalists who see the end of the monarchy as a great moral and psychological blow. While some are resigned to the end of the empire and simply want to feel heard, others will undoubtedly continue the fight for the Emperor. Some have even gone to Austria to join the Emperor, undoubtedly to plan a future putch."
kr.hungary.22.a:0 "More's the pity."

kr.hungary.12.t:0 "Social Democratic Provisional Government"
kr.hungary.12.d:0 "The first government of an independent Hungary since 1848 has been sworn in to lead the fledgeling nation. The Social Democratic Party of Hungary promises a better, fairer Hungary with work for every man and food on every table. Prime Minister Árpád Szakasits makes the first step towards that future by inviting Syndicalist and Socialist politicians previously banished by the Imperial government to return to Hungary. This includes men with dangerous ties to arch-syndicalists in Paris, such as Bela Kun, Tibor Szamuely, and Mátyás Rákosi."
kr.hungary.12.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers!"

kr.hungary.13.t:0 "Totalists Assume Control"
kr.hungary.13.d:0 "Prime Minister Árpád Szakasits was always a fellow traveler to the Syndicalist movement. It was for this reason that he invited the arch-leftists of Hungarian politics to return home to Hungary. And it was for this reason he incorporated many of their most influential number in his government, including Bela Kun and Mátyás Rákosi. These Totalists, with their revolutionary ideals and ties to Paris, quickly amassed a following in the new Hungarian government.\n\n And outmaneuvered Szakasits... While the Prime Minister thought he was in control, the Communists plotted. They filled the government with their fellows; squeezed out those of questionable loyalty. It wasn't long before the newspaper began referring to Kun's government rather than Szakasits'. Ultimately, a motion was put on the Prime Minister's desk, signed by the leaders of Szakasits' party and government, demanding greater authority and responsibility for the Foreign Minister: Bela Kun. Szakasits will be allowed a ceremonial position in the government."
kr.hungary.13.a:0 "Well then..."

kr.hungary.21.t:0 "Traditionalists Protest the Return of Totalists"
kr.hungary.21.d:0 "Hungary's right-wing has launched vocal and apoplectic critiques of the Szakasits government for its decision to invite revolutionary socialists such as Bela Kun back to Hungary. Even moderates like Károlyi argue that men like Bela Kun, who fought in the Russian Civil War on the side of Lenin, were exiled for good reason."

kr.hungary.23.d:0 "If Hungary is to be saved from the depths of Black Monday, then it must reach for bold, creative solutions. We must break the chains of labor, liberate the working class, and throw down the parasitic landlords and clergyman growing fat off the backs of Hungary's lifeblood. No idea is too beyond the pale. Social revolution requires a will of iron! And if doubters come to critique our methods, believe in ultimate victory!"
kr.hungary.23.a:0 "We will outlast them!"

kr.hungary.24.t:0 "Grain, Not Kronen"
kr.hungary.24.d:0 "Bela Kun has introduced a novel idea to solve Hungary's food shortage and the punishing taxes that peasant farmers have labored under for decades. As many farmers are currently hoarding their goods because of the ongoing grain crisis throughout Central Europe and the flood on the market created by Ukraine, we shall offer a compromise. From now on, farmers may pay their taxes in grain marked for shipment to Budapest. Further hoarding of grain will be considered a crime against the revolution."
kr.hungary.24.a:0 "Why are they complaining?"

kr.hungary.25.t:0 "Total Collectivization Meets Roadblocks"
kr.hungary.25.d:0 "Many farmers are resisting state attempts to collectivize their farms. Some peasants wonder aloud why the lands of Hungarian nobility have not yet been redistributed to the poor. Advisors from Paris have urged Bela Kun to reconsider his decision to totally collectivize all Hungarian farmland under government administrators, as redistribution would buy much-needed goodwill from the rural working class. Kun counters that such foolishness would not only introduce unforgivable inefficiencies into Hungary's agriculture industry, but would also render the peasant farmers into newly minted, land holders, spreading the disease of capitalism to the poor."
kr.hungary.25.a:0 "What do Parisians know, anyway?"

kr.hungary.26.t:0 "The Jacobin Boys"
kr.hungary.26.d:0 "It was initially assumed that the peasant class of rural Hungary would flock to the socialists upon their return to the country, as Kun and his associates were the only men in Hungary willing to take on the peasant class's traditional abusers, the Aristocrats and the Church. Unfortunately, farmers have been some of the most resistant to the Party's reforms, even in the midst of banditry and food shortages. Tibor Szamuely, Commissar of Military Affairs, has proposed using his ever-expanding personal bodyguard, the affectionaly named Jacobin Boys, to remind such uncooperative counter-revolutionaries of their place in the New Hungary. Many of the Jacobin Boys are bandits, thugs, and gangsters who took advantage of the poor in the days after Black Monday. This is experience Szamuely thinks he can put to good use."

The victory of the Hungarian Proletariat has not cost major sacrifices thus far. But now the situation demands that blood must flow. We must not be afraid of blood. Blood is steel. It strengthens our hearts; it strengthens the fist of the Proletariat. Blood will make us powerful. Blood will lead us to the true world of the Commune. We will exterminate the entire bourgeoisie if we have to!"

kr.hungary.30.t:0 "The State Protection Authority"
kr.hungary.30.d:0 "The new Hungarian state requires something more formal than the Jacobin Boys and with a softer touch than the Red Army. The State Protection Authority will be part police force, part espionage agency. Hungary has adversaries both without and within. Enemies of the revolution constantly plot in our midst, and they will be ferreted out by the noble men of the SPA, through secret arrests, spying, torture, and whatever other methods are necessary to collect information that will serve the Revolution. And Mátyás Rákosi is the man to lead it."
kr.hungary.30.a:0 "Rákosi will defend Hungary."

kr.hungary.31.t:0 "Social Democrats Sidelined"
kr.hungary.31.d:0 "Framed at first as simply a more efficient reorganizing of the state's administrative apparatus, it has become clear with every nomination put forward by Bela Kun, and confirmed by his friends in the Republican Council, that Totalists and Socialists are being put in control of ever more ministries and Szakasits' remaining social democratic allies, if not pushed to resign, are left with junior positions and unimportant posts. Szakasits, himself, has given up the title of Prime Minister. It was a bourgeois title from a more corrupt time, anyway... Meanwhile, ever more power has been concentrated in the hands of Kun's Foreign Ministry, and his pets, Szamuely and Rákosi, control the military and economic departments of the government. While Szakasits was offered the newly minted Ministry of Esperantist Affairs, he has instead 'chosen' to retire... after nominating Bela Kun as his successor."
kr.hungary.31.a:0 "So long. Farewell."

kr.hungary.32.t:0 "Naming the Party"
kr.hungary.32.d:0 "A great many Hungarian socialists, syndicalists, and Totalists have their own ideas on what the name of the new unity party between Social Democrats and orthodox Syndicalists ought to be. While a name is a petty thing, it has led to rancorous argument, as this will be the name that leads the revolution! Some say it should be called the Party of Socialists in Hungary, as most of their members are not actually ethnic Hungarians. Others argue that it should be the Hungarian Socialist Party, as it is the party of the nation's leftwing! Still more say this does not specifically address the movement's roots and it should be called the Party of Socialist Communist Workers of Hungary. While such a blatant reference to the parties of the Russian Civil War is bound to turn heads in Berlin and Paris (albeit for different reasons), Bela Kun has ultimately settled on the Hungarian Communist Party. And few are willing to argue with him."
kr.hungary.32.a:0 "Splitters!"

kr.hungary.33.t:0 "Hungarian Kulturkampf"
kr.hungary.33.d:0 "The term 'Kulturkampf' dates back to the nascent German Empire's conflict with the Catholic Church for control of educational institutions in the nation. Our own program goes far beyond religious schooling. We must abolish religion itself, and the illusory happiness it grants the worker, in order that we might show them the way to true happiness. Just as opium reduces suffering, but does not cure the patient, leaving him addicted to its succor, so does the Church blind people to the struggles of the working class. In such a way, it is the tool of oppressors and must be destroyed!"
kr.hungary.33.a:0 "Down with the church!"

kr.hungary.34.t:0 "Abolish Aristocracy"
kr.hungary.34.d:0 "Marx knew the landed aristocracy was an outmoded concept that would be destroyed by the rising bourgeoisie and the capitalist system, but he underestimated to what lengths these feudal parasites would go to maintain their position at the top of the social hierarchy. In order to combat this scourge, the Hungarian Republic of Councils has announced that henceforth, all aristocratic titles shall be abolished. Land that has not already been confiscated by the state will be collectivized and overseen by government administrators. Many nobles have begun fleeing the country, attempting to take their stolen wealth with them."
kr.hungary.34.a:0 "Down with the Nobility!"

kr.hungary.35.t:0 "New Norms"
kr.hungary.35.d:0 "Like much of Central Europe, Hungarian society languishes under stultifying moral rules informed by the church, feudal society, and millenia of hierarchies. It is said that in America and Paris, many communes have torn down these artificial hierarchy through critical assessment of traditional social norms. While Bela Kun personally believes that the Hungarian people possess a national spirit far and above those of their neighbors, he has decided to mimic the movements of the West and dedicate the state to abolishing all forms of prejudice, be they racial, sexual, or otherwise. Are we not all brothers and sisters in Hungary? Unfortunately, this has not gone over well with the population outside of Budapest, famous for their Magyar chauvinism..."
kr.hungary.35.a:0 "Maybe we should slow things down...."

kr.hungary.36.t:0 "Rumblings from the SPA"
kr.hungary.36.d:0 "Bela Kun has never been popular. In Hungary or Paris or Moscow or any other place he's been. While his revolutionary bona fides are beyond question and his bravery in the face of oppressors is well-respected, his attitude and mannerisms have won him few friends. He is argumentative, pedantic, and far too sure of himself. Moreover, his personal brand of revolution, much more radical and violent than that seen in the Commune or the Union of Britain, has Paris worried about Hungary. And the same worries have been heard within the State Protection Authority... with some whispers even connecting such complaints to Mátyás Rákosi..."
kr.hungary.36.a:0 "Suspcious... Most suspicious."

kr.hungary.37.t:0 "Secret Meetings in the SPA"
kr.hungary.37.d:0 "Our spies have alerted us that the rumblings in the SPA and the Republican Council have gone beyond mere complaints. Szamuely has identified a number of secret meetings taking place throughout Budapest, attended by high-ranking members of the party and the State Protection Authority, all of whom are known to be opponents of Kun's hardline reforms. To his great regret (so he says), Szamuely also reports that Mátyás Rákosi has been followed to these clandestine meetings. Surely, a plot most foul is afoot."
kr.hungary.37.a:0 "Rákosi is loyal!"
kr.hungary.37.b:0 "Let's nip this in the bud..."

kr.hungary.38.t:0 "The Rákosi Plot"
kr.hungary.38.d:0 "At 04:00 this morning, agents of the State Protection Authority arrested Foreign Minister Bela Kun. He was charged with a myriad list of crimes against the revolution, as well as corruption. Kun's friends and allies in the Republican Council were either arrested as co-conspirators or coerced into silence. In addition to his crimes, Kun was blamed for the food shortages, the deprivations of the Jacobin Boys, the cruelty of the Red Terror, and the most abusive excesses of the revolutionary tribunals. Pleas sent to Kun's erstwhile allies in Paris were ignored, and his French advisors stood beside Mátyás Rákosi when he announced to the nation that it was liberated from its newest tyrant. Szamuely, with a fleet of new badges on his chest, joined Rákosi to announce Kun's downfall."
kr.hungary.38.a:0 "Damn you! Damn you all to Hell!"

kr.hungary.39.t:0 "Rákosi Caught"
kr.hungary.39.d:0 "At 22:00 yesterday evening, Mátyás Rákosi was arrested as part of a round-up of counter-revolutionary plotters in Budapest. He was attending a meeting with social democrats and military officials who had secretly harbored resentment against the revolution! Or so the Red News says. As part of his public pronouncement, Bela Kun laid the blame for the Red Terror and the excessive abuses of the revolutionary tribunals at the feet of Mátyás Rákosi and his State Protection Authority, which Rákosi was apparently turning into a facsimile of the Emperor's despicable Evidenzbureau. As part of the government shake-up, Tibor Szamuely will take Rákosi's place at the head of the SPA and his Jacobin Boys will be formalized as part of the government."

kr.hungary.100.d:0 "The memory of 1848 has been redeemed. The independence that Hungarians have sought for nearly two centuries is close at hand, and for the first time since the nineteenth century, Hungarians have chosen a government without Habsburg consent. It is led by the giant of the right, the master of compromise: Count István Bethlen de Bethlen. He has the confidence of most of Hungary's political stakeholders, from its urban industrialists to its rural aristocrats and the potentates of the Roman Catholic Church. Not the most ardent proponent of Hungarian independence, Bethlen is expected to be a stabilizing force during this period of transition."

As a result, the government has called for the formation of a National Council, made up of Hungary's leading politicians, economists, businessmen, and nobility. They will agree upon guiding principles and goals for the Hungarian People's Republic, principal among them being the path out of the financial disaster wrought by Black Monday and the European Grain Crisis. In addition, the National Council will set domestic and foreign policy for newly independent Hungary, including its position towards Austria, the non-Magyar nationalities within Hungary, suffrage, and land reform."

But if all parties are against waste, how does the waste remain? Because they don't target the origin of the waste: the government, itself! If Hungary is to maintain a treasury capable of addressing the people's needs and responding to Black Monday, it must create a lean administration and a smaller bureaucracy, less peopled by the nephews and cousins of noblemen and party leaders."

After the failed revolution of 1848, he travelled across Europe and the United States, evangelizing the case for an independent Hungary. He has been called the George Washington of Hungary. Prime Minister István Bethlen has redeemed Kossuth's dream. Now, he walks in the steps of Kossuth, visiting the capitals of Europe. He is not only Hungary's leader, but its face to the world.

Now, however, the militias have turned their guns on the state. Party officials and Jacobin Boys attempting to collect the grain tribute and enforce land collectivization have been murdered. Most disturbingly, their mutilated bodies are left in public and superstitious peasants are seemingly too afraid to testify about the whereabouts of the militias.

Army officials in the capital are unsure of the reason for such blatant insubordination, though they have their suspicions.

The delay which followed undermined the confidence the neutral members of the military had in the counterrevolution. When the people failed to rise up in favor of the usurpers, the rest of the army declared for Bela Kun's government. The hours that followed were chaotic. Infighting between nationalist and legitimist factions became apparent. The forces of reaction bled away. Lehár and Horthy retreated to Szeged, making plans to return to Austria.

He was arrested, charged with a litany of crimes against Hungary, including leading a 'revolutionary terrorist organization' and personal responsibility for the thousands of killings carried out by his government. Rather than a trial, Prónay and his officers insisted on a military tribunal. It did not take long before Kun was declared guilty of crimes against the state.

kr.hungary.219.d:0 "The saboteur's bomb failed to detonate. He tried desperately to light his vest by other means, but was tackled by members of the monarchist coalition before he could commit his foul deed. The Syndicalist saboteur refused to give up his compatriots, even as other attacks took place throughout Budapest, but following hours of torture, he finally broke and admitted that he was in fact a member of Prónay's White Guard; part of a plot to remove his rivals within the National Defense League and make way for the National Socialist takeover of Hungary. Attempted murder of Hungarian national heroes like Miklós Horthy and Anton Lehár has turned most of the coalition against Prónay. The old devil makes a fighting retreat out of the city with his White Guard, out into the Hungarian wilderness, to fight another day."
kr.hungary.219.a:0 "Knew he was trouble!"

kr.hungary.220.t:0 "The National Palatine"
kr.hungary.220.d:0 "In the time since Pál Prónay took control of Hungary, he has surrounded himself with more-experienced rightist politicians, especially those associated with the National Socialist philosophy of Gyula Gömbös. These include men such as Béla Imrédy and László Bárdossy. Prónay is now supreme leader and Lord Palatine, ostensibly governing the nation in lieu of the Habsburg King, but without plans to revive the Dual Monarchy in the near future. He will forge a new Hungary, based on the long and storied history of the Magyar people, and destroy all foreign influence, Austrian, German, or otherwise. He will restore the pride and independence of Magyarország. He has selected the famed professor, geographer, and ethnographer, Count Pál Teleki, as his prime minister."
kr.hungary.220.a:0 "Who needs a King, anyway?"

kr.hungary.221.t:0 "National Socialism"
kr.hungary.221.d:0 "A uniquely Hungarian philosophical movement has taken hold of politics. Divorced from similar movements like Legionarism and Integralism, some call it a mix of social conservatism and syndicalist economics. This is much too simple. It is a total worldview; an appeal to the natural instincts of Man. Called 'National Socialism' and popularized by the late leader of the right, Gyula Gömbös, it now influences many of those leading the nation's government, including the Palatine himself. Gömbös advocated a 'unitary Hungarian nation without class distinctions.'\n\nOnly fools question how the Palatine could balance such idealistic promises with the interests of magnates, farmers, and the church. The bedrock foundation of the National Socialist worldview enables him to draw the right conclusions."

kr.hungary.222.t:0 "An Appeal to Tradition"
kr.hungary.222.d:0 "Peasants and aristocrats owe their lives to the Palatine. Was it not he that first went into the country to protect them from the bandits of Black Monday? Was it not his brave White Guardsmen that put a stop to Szamuely's deprivations? Now, the Palatine calls upon them to do their part to deliver Hungary from its economic woes. And to forget all of these poisonous, socialist ideas like Class Warfare. Prónay wishes to reconcile the traditional good relations between landlords and estate servants so that all of us might work together to build a better Magyarország."
kr.hungary.222.a:0 "Remember who protected you."

kr.hungary.223.t:0 "The Hungarian Miracle"
kr.hungary.223.d:0 "Against all the odds and expectations, the Hungarian economy has recovered. Not through the advice of international bankers or loans from covetous foreign powers, but through the policy and faith of National Socialism. But they have won few friends. In this militaristic economic miracle, the Hungarian state has declared itself an enemy of the capitalist economic system with its exploitation of the economically weak and unseemly evaluation of human potential according to wealth and property rather than duty and merit. While Black Monday is merely a memory, there may yet be consequences for the sin of opposing international finance."
kr.hungary.223.a:0 "Long live Hungary!"

kr.hungary.224.t:0 "White Terror Unleashed"
kr.hungary.224.d:0 "The White Terror is more than a match for the Red in ferocity and fervor. But where the Red Terror of Bela Kun was a political act, Prónay's White Terror is a time of vengeance; of settling old grudges. The violence is sadistic and humiliating. Budapest, a city infected with socialism, must be purged. The dynamiting of churches, the murder of priests, the torture of dissidents is repaid tenfold. And if a journalist or a merchant possesses a coat a soldier likes? Or a home situated well on the Danube? Well, perhaps he's a Kunist as well..."
kr.hungary.224.a:0 "Rivers of blood!"

kr.hungary.225.t:0 "The White Guard"
kr.hungary.225.d:0 "Many assumed that the right-wing militias would disperse after Prónay toppled the Communist government in Budapest. How wrong they were. Victory merely emboldened them, and militias began ransacking the city, acting as little more than uniformed gangsters tolerated by the new rulers of Hungary. Most of their targets were ostensibly enemies of the new regime: trade unionists, rebellious peasants, the politically liberal, and Jews. But a sustained campaign of murder and pillaging also generated sympathy for the victims among the vast Hungarian public. \n\nLest Prónay's coup d'etat spawn a counter-coup in turn, the Palatine has demanded that the militias be united and organized into a state-run entity. Known as the White Guard, these former militia-men will act as the strong right arm of the Hungarian nation, hunting whatever syndicalist scoundrels remain and enforcing the peace within rural parts of the country still plagued by banditry. This discipline has been purchased with government salaries promised by membership in the White Guard, as well as promises of violent retribution for any militias that continue to defy the state."

kr.hungary.228.d:0 "Prior to the dissolution the Crownlands of St. Stephen and the creation of Illyria, the Hungarian Sea Scouts were the pride and joy of Hungary's scouting movement; even going so far as to send delegations to scouting conferences across Europe. Teleki seeks to expand the role scouting has in Hungary, especially for shaping boys as they become men. Combined with his penchant for geography, Teleki has taken a brief detour from his duties as prime minister to organize the Arpadi Scouts, a nation-wide organization devoted to teach young men how to survive in the wilderness and survey the land. Every Hungarian boy will be light infantry in the making."

kr.hungary.229.d:0 "Prime Minister Teleki's 'Red Map' is one of Hungary's most comprehensive studies of ethnic groups within the nation. Despite what the Palatine may say about a united Hungary, the truth is the country is a mix of many nations. If the Hungarian government is to make sense of this national confusion, some deliberate myth-making must take place. Each ethnic group within Hungary must have a place in this story, and the destiny of Magyars to rule the Pannonian Basin must be established in a modern Gesta Hungarorum. The Turanic Movement, which traces Magyar ancestry back to the warrior kings of Parthia, will be essential for proselytizing the new national myths."

kr.hungary.230.d:0 "As part of Count Teleki's general review of the Hungarian educational system, the Palatine has issued a proclamation bringing his personal touch of 'national revenge' to the academic field. In addition to censoring and banning a variety of anti-Hungarian, anti-clerical, and pro-syndicalist works, the Palatine believes it would be in the nation's interest to take part in a national catharsis of physically destroying the books. Average citizens are cordially invited to attend book burnings in major cities where they can witness the poisonous filth being destroyed. This has been received with some enthusiasm by the peasant class which never read much anyway but neither liked middle class Hungarians and their books!"

kr.hungary.231.t:0 "National Restoration"
kr.hungary.231.d:0 "The Lord Palatine of Hungary, addressed a crowd in Budapest to welcome a new golden age for the Hungary. With the twin forces of the new Hungarian Army and National Socialism, Hungary is born anew and ready to achieve its destiny as one of the great powers of Europe. No more Austrian domination or Turkish threats; Magyarország is a power unto itself. While the Palatine still ostensibly rules Hungary in the name of the King, it is unlikely that a Habsburg or any other European monarch will restore royal rule to Hungary in the near future.\n\nFurthermore, the Palatine demands that Hungary be referred to as 'Magyaria' in all non-Hungarian diplomatic cables, both to demarcate this new period. After all, the people of Hungary have always called their nation 'Magyarország.'"
kr.hungary.231.a:0 "A new power is rising!"

kr.hungary.232.t:0 "Anti-Jewish Laws"
kr.hungary.232.d:0 "It began with the 'Closed Number' law. Numerus Clausus required that Hungarian universities must admit students based on their proportional representation within the population; to ensure fair admissions. Of course, as Jews were the only minority group overrepresented in Hungarian universities, they were the only group deleteriously impacted by the law. More so-called 'anti-Jewish laws' followed, with the Teleki government always phrasing them as necessary reforms for fairness and 'social justice.' Similar quotas were enacted in business and professional licenses. Despite making up only six percent of Hungary's population, over half of physicians and lawyers in Hungary were Jewish! This could only be the result of systematic exclusion. A further decree ensured some measure of work for these newly unemployed Jews by requiring that all able-bodied, jobless Jewish men join forced labor battalions to rebuild parts of Budapest burned or destroyed during the revolution.\n\n According to Teleki, his laws were meant to disperse power throughout society, especially in light of the heavily Jewish character of Hungary's abortive socialist revolution, including leaders such as Bela Kun, Mátyás Rákosi, and Tibor Szamuely. For reasons of national security, Jews are henceforth banned from holding government positions. The international community has been less than receptive to such laws...  "

The most suitable candidate is Archduke Joseph August, the Emperor's cousin. He was a well-decorated commander in the Weltkrieg and popular with the troops, especially those of Hungarian origin.

On one side, conservative members of the cabinet argue the case of Hungarian nationalists. To give equal representation to non-Magyar nationalities in government and schooling would be to divide the nation against itself; to set the stage for more nationalist uprisings in the next decade to mirror those of a century before. Besides, to intervene would tip the balance of power and rob the Hungarian government of its decision-making power.\n\nOn the other hand, other members of His Majesty’s cabinet argue that national self-determination is the way of the future, and that if His Majesty wants to avoid such nationalist revolts, he must give some leeway to non-Magyars within Hungary. Furthermore, it is only just that families should be able to educate their children in their own language. It is up to His Majesty to decide the fate of Hungarian nationalities."

However, representatives from the Hungarian government note that expanding the vote in such a broad fashion will only make it easier for saboteurs and traitors to make their way into positions of power. For this reason, the franchise must be limited those who have earned the privilege, such as members of the nobility and knightly orders."

For many years, the church was the primary educational institution in the country. Since the turn of the century, the Hungarian government has taken on more responsibility for the education of Hungary’s children, but has done more to indoctrinate them as good Magyars than teach literature and arithmetic. Still, much of His Majesty’s cabinet advises against making any major inroads into the Hungarian educational system. As has been seen throughout Asia and South America, expanded school systems are often used as an inroad for Syndicalist teachers to spread their hateful gospel to naïve peasants."

From a young age and throughout his life, His Majesty demonstrated an awareness of God's presence and Christian duty. As was his Christian duty, he halted strategic bombing of civilian populations, restricted the use of mustard gas, and was adamantly opposed to submarine warfare and the mining of harbors. Yet the Church in Hungary has also exerted overbearing influence; frequently taking the side of the country’s most conservative wing and making many enemies of its own.

Instead, Prónay has given his blessing to Teleki's government; especiially of the various domestic policies Teleki has instituted to purify and bring order to Hungarian society. Despite his old age, Prónay has taken to hunting and hiking in northern Hungary, perhaps inspired by Teleki's embrace of the World Organization of Scouts... or re-living his days of hunting Communists and Jacobin Boys in the hills."

For many Magyars, he is the symbol of national resurrection. For the other nationalities of Hungary, he is a thug and a bandit. On the international scene, his reputation was always complicated by the White Terror. Prime Minister Pál Teleki long ago stepped up to lead the nation, but the seat of the Lord Palatine now vacant."

The first option is to invite the well-known socialite Antoine Bibesco to rule Romania. He is the grandson of the last ruler of Wallachia and as such bears the title of Prince. Since he lacks a real power base, he would be a loyal ally, but still give some legitimacy to the new regime due to his royal heritage.\n\nThe other option is to invite the former Regent of Romania, Prince Nicholas to form a government. He is the younger brother of the former Crown Prince Carol, who has refused to rule as a puppet king. Under the former military regime Nicholas' position as Regent was already nothing more than a puppet, so it is expected he won't cause trouble, while still nominally continue the rule of the Hohenzollern dynasty."

Hungarian authorities are hereby commanded to withdraw from the territories of Slovakia and Transylvania. \n\nRefusal would reject an imperial decree; an act of disloyalty to the Emperor that would no doubt lead to dire consequences for the Dual Monarchy.

HUN_democratic_black_monday_desc:0 "The celebrations for our new republic will have to wait; the economic crisis in Europe has taken a turn for the worse, and with the political situation in the Balkans so uncertain, our top priority must be halting our fiscal nosedive before our financial sector collapses completely."
HUN_national_council:0 "The National Economic Council"
HUN_national_council_desc:0 "Hungary is scraping the bottom of barrel to meet the needs of the current financial crisis, and it can barely keep its industry up and running; with this in mind, the administration has called a meeting of Hungary's elite. Every economist, industrialist, politician, and aristocrat of note is called to form a National Economic Council to address the consequences of Black Monday."

HUN_reform_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Hungarian bureaucrats, much like their Austrian and Ottoman compatriots, are subject to derision in the great cities of Europe. With Hungary's recent reformation into a republic, we now have the opportunity to fix the critical flaws in our system, rendering it more efficient, less costly, and more capable of responding to the Black Monday crisis."
HUN_special_interests:0 "Placate Special Interests"
HUN_special_interests_desc:0 "Everybody has a price, and any real attempt to combat our decline is going to require the aid of Hungary's industrial and political elite.

HUN_black_monday_democratic_recovery_desc:0 "The exhausting process of countering economic recession has finally born fruit.

HUN_bethlen_machine_desc:0 "Political machines are typically capable of maintaining political and administrative control of a city or province. Bethlen is determined to make this policy work nationwide.

"
HUN_revive_governing_party:0 "The Governing Party"
HUN_revive_governing_party_desc:0 "Today marks the birth of a new political force in Hungary.

HUN_democratic_magyarization:0 "Assimilation and Magyarization"
HUN_democratic_magyarization_desc:0 "Hungary's greatest weakness is its internal division. Diversity of cultural and language results in a diversity of interests, with the Slavs and Germans always ready to act as a Fifth Column for the Great Powers.

There are, as yet, too many Legitimists, conservative aristocrats, and socialists left in positions of power after the revolution. Károlyi is not the man to use authoritarian tactics, but by combining the positions of Prime Minister and President, he can maintain exclusive authority over foreign policy."
HUN_pacific_industry:0 "Pacific Industry"
HUN_pacific_industry_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, Károlyi was one of few politicians to advocate against the war. His pacifism even risked his life, as his attempts to reach out to the Entente often painted a target on his back. Now, Károlyi intends to direct government funds to reinvigorate Hungarian industry, but not traditional sectors such as defense. Instead, the Hungarian government will subsidize peacetime industry."
HUN_eastern_switzerland:0 "The Eastern Switzerland"

HUN_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "Hungary, before the revolution, was a very unfair place. Not only were Hungarians ruled over by Austrians, but most Hungarians were ruled by a tiny percentage of their population.

HUN_democratic_welfare:0 "Noblesse Oblige"
HUN_democratic_welfare_desc:0 "Despite (or perhaps because of) coming from one of the most wealthy and influential aristocratic families in Hungary, Károlyi has always felt a need to give back to his fellow man. His embrace of social welfare policies have often put him at odds with his fellow noblemen, and now, as Prime Minister, he can put his feelings of noblesse oblige into effect, with an endowment for the Hungarian poor."

HUN_social_democracy_apparently:0 "Is this Social Democracy?"
HUN_social_democracy_apparently_desc:0 "The social-democratic way of thinking erroneously interchanges the economic \"moderate\" with the political and social \"possible\".

It will solve two problems at once."

HUN_jacobin_boys_desc:0 "Revolutions are the locomotives of history; not only in the objective sense, but also in the sense of their rapid development of the minds of the workers, within whom there takes place a process of deliberate re-examination of all previous values. This re-examination was a catalyst for many young workers to organize in gangs and deliver retribution against the capitalists."

The name is of utmost importance!"

The Palatine has finally put an end to this futile conflict."

A renowned geographer and ethnographer, Count Pál Teleki became interested in scouting after his son, Geza, joined the Hungarian Sea Scouts in 1927. A close friend of Robert Baden-Powell since 1930, Count Teleki emphasizes the pains Hungary must take to prepare its young men for the future."
HUN_turanism:0 "Turanic Myth-Making"
HUN_turanism_desc:0 "Hungarian nobiliary historical tradition considered the Turkish peoples the closest relatives of Hungarians. This tradition was preserved in medieval chronicles such as Gesta Hungarorum. We Hungarians are a martial people. Just as the Polish see in themselves the Sarmatians, we are the successors of Scythia, Parthia, and great Turan!"
HUN_assimilation_overdrive:0 "Magyarization Overdrive"
HUN_assimilation_overdrive_desc:0 "The Hungarian secondary school is like a huge machine, at one end of which the Slovak and Romanian youths are thrown in by the hundreds, and at the other end of which they come out as Magyars. Just as France unified a nation of disparate ethnic groups behind the French language, so must Hungary. One country - one language - one nation!"
HUN_numerus_clausus:0 "Numerus Clausus"
HUN_numerus_clausus_desc:0 "Originating in Roman law, the Numerus Clausus laws were designed to limit the number of people practicing a given profession. Count Teleki has designed new Numerus Clausus laws for Hungary, specifically to limit the number of Jews in education, legal, and medical fields where they are historically overrepresented compared to the Hungarian population. Naturally, these laws also bar Jews from public service."
HUN_reeducation_reform:0 "Re-Education Reform"
HUN_reeducation_reform_desc:0 "The Communists greatly damaged Hungary's educational institutions during their short reign of terror from Budapest. Hungarian nationalists will now work to remove degenerate, atheistic influences and return to a Christian, patriotic school system. After all, the philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of the government in the next."
HUN_magyaria:0 "Magyaria"
HUN_magyaria_desc:0 "What do we know of cultured ways, the gilt, the craft and the lie? We, who were born in a naked land and bred in the open sky. The subtle tongue, the sophist guile, they fail when the broadswords sing; Rush in and die, dogs — we were men before we were kings."

HUN_apostolic_majesty:0 "His Apostolic Majesty"
HUN_apostolic_majesty_desc:0 "Loyalty to the crown, above all else. Hungarians have served the Habsburg kings with distinction and loyalty for centuries. They will continue to serve His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty, IV Károly."
HUN_resolve_economic_crisis:0 "Resolving the Economic Crisis"
HUN_resolve_economic_crisis_desc:0 "This is a nightmare, which will pass away with the morning. For the resources of nature and men's devices are just as fertile and productive as they were. The rate of our progress towards solving the material problems of life is not less rapid. We are as capable as before of affording for everyone a high standard of life … and will soon learn to afford a standard higher still."
HUN_government_support:0 "Economic Stimulus"
HUN_government_support_desc:0 "Certain economic theories posit that the solution to economic recession is money. The market is a chemical reaction with positive feedback. Inject some money into the market, using whatever remains in the treasury, and watch it generate yet more economic activity. Some of the Cabinet's conservative members fear the repercussions for our creditors, but all solutions must be explored!"
HUN_renovate_budapest:0 "Renovate Budapest"
HUN_renovate_budapest_desc:0 "The catastrophe of Black Monday ruined the capital overnight. Commerce vanished. Vagabonds and criminals roamed the streets, ransacking businesses. We need to put people back to work; get money in their pockets. Kill two birds with one stone by employing the jobless masses to repair the city."
HUN_austrian_subsidies:0 "Austrian Subsidies"
HUN_austrian_subsidies_desc:0 "Naturally, Austria’s industry recovered faster than Hungary’s agriculture-based economy, unaffected as it was by the Ukrainian Grain Crisis. The treasuries of Austria and Hungary both belong to the his Apostolic Majesty. It is a simple matter to transfer funds from one to the other. As Hungarian blood paid for Austrian hegemony, let Austrian gold pay for Hungarian recovery."
HUN_austerity_measures:0 "Austerity Measures"
HUN_austerity_measures_desc:0 "If we are to pull through this economic depression, we must tighten our grip on the economy like a vice, and reduce spending to a trickle in order to build up our cash reserves. Our people will be outraged by this, but they must be made to understand the severity of our situation."
HUN_deregulation:0 "Deregulation Scheme"
HUN_deregulation_desc:0 "Bureaucratic redtape hamstrings the engines of industry. While the state attempts to stockpile capital for emergency situations, economic activity grinds to a halt. Regulations render investors risk averse and increase the cost of entrepreneuership, precisely when we need their activity in the market most! We must follow the advice of Budapest's business class and unleash the titans of industry."
HUN_christian_charity:0 "Christian Charity"
HUN_christian_charity_desc:0 "The Hungarian Crown is not the only organizations helping to combat the impact of the crisis on our people. Churches have thrown open their doors to the poor. This spirit of charity should be encouraged among the noble and wealthy in our country, while the state reserves its fund for emergency situations."
HUN_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery"
HUN_national_recovery_desc:0 "Though the struggles of our people will continue on for years to come, it seems that the decisive actions taken by his Apostolic Majesty and his Cabinet have seen us through the worst of the Black Monday crisis. Life has returned to the streets of our cities, and the atmosphere has changed from one of despair to one of cautious optimism for the future."
HUN_servant_leader:0 "Servant-Leader"
HUN_servant_leader_desc:0 "His Apostolic Majesty demands the allegiance of most of the nations of Central Europe, but he has always conceived himself as the First Servant of the State. He has dedicated himself to the realm and its people, putting their needs above his own, even to the point of questioning the Weltkrieg. Karl is an example to all monarchs."
HUN_nationalities_law:0 "The Nationalities Law"
HUN_nationalities_law_desc:0 "The Nationalities Law of 1868 guaranteed citizenship to all ethnic groups within the Kingdom of Hungary. Hungary and all its people were to be one indivisible, unitary nation. Its minorities were to be educated and governed in their own languages. Yet appeals to this law have been scorned or ignored for decades. His Apostolic Majesty must consider the future of Hungary and its non-Magyar nationalities."
HUN_monarchist_franchise:0 "Hungarian Suffrage"
HUN_monarchist_franchise_desc:0 "Unlike Austria, where the people have had the vote since 1896, Hungarians do not enjoy universal suffrage. The vote is limited to less than ten percent of the population, made up of aristocrats, petty nobility, high-ranking military officers, and bureaucrats. His Apostolic Majesty will decide the future of Hungarian politics."
HUN_monarchist_education:0 "Educate the Masses"
HUN_monarchist_education_desc:0 "The Hungarian state made schooling compulsory for children in 1868. After all, an educated population is a capable population. Nevertheless, state-run schools typically focused more on Magyarization than education. Universities in Hungary have been hotbeds of Socialist activity. Many within government now question whether the state's education drive has been counterproductive."
HUN_monarchist_church:0 "The Role of the Church"
HUN_monarchist_church_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has long been an ally to Hungarian aristocracy and Habsburg royalty. This made the Church the enemy of social reform movements in the nation. During the 19th century, the Liberal Party limited church power, introduced social reforms, and reduced the church's near-total dominance of Hungarian educational institutions. His Apostolic Majesty must decide the future role of the church."
HUN_old_wounds:0 "Old Wounds Healed"
HUN_old_wounds_desc:0 "Austria and Hungary are two nations led by one King. This has made them simultaneously friends and rivals, with Hungary often chaffing beneath the rule of an ostensibly Austrian dynasty. Yet, today, it seems Kaiser Karl I & IV has united these disparate nations; healed the old wounds dating back to 1848 and created a symbiotic Dual Monarchy, to the benefit of both countries. God bless Austria-Hungary!"
HUN_hail_to_the_kaiser:0 "Hail to the Kaiser"
HUN_hail_to_the_kaiser_desc:0 "By the grace of God, the servants of His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty continue to guide Hungary. The Hungarian Honvédség guards the borders, but many problems yet survive in the interior. We must hurry to reestablish Habsburg rule while the syndicalist and nationalist menaces remains cowed. The House of Habsburg-Lorraine is ordained by Christ, our Lord, as sovereign of the Danube."
HUN_vitezi_rend:0 "Vitézi Rend"
HUN_vitezi_rend_desc:0 "His Apostolic Majesty founds a new Hungarian order of merit, the Vitézi Rend, to be awarded only to the most loyal and exemplary servants of Hungary. Admittance into the Order is based on military merit, measured by the number of medals won on the fields of the Weltkrieg. Admission to the order also carries with it a land grant of 40 cadastral holds, measuring almost 60 acres of land."
HUN_combat_extremism:0 "Suppress Extremism"
HUN_combat_extremism_desc:0 "Hungary cannot risk another uprising, not with the Empire in such disarray, and not with the Commune on our doorstep, willing to fund revolutions across Europe. Worse still, Hungarian Nationalists can no longer be trusted, having shown their willingness to betray His Apostolic Majesty for their own gain. The Austrian Evidenzbureau will be extended to Hungary to stomp out vile radicals of all stripes."
HUN_special_relationship:0 "The Special Relationship"
HUN_special_relationship_desc:0 "It is from the gilded halls of Vienna that the strength of the Kingdom of Hungary's industrial sector flows, just as the River Danube cascades down throughout the Empire to the Adriatic sea, bringing the fruits of Hungary's harvest. This symbiosis will facilitate the reconstruction of Hungary's economic and political ties with Austria."
HUN_bulwark_empire:0 "Bulwark of the Empire"
HUN_bulwark_empire_desc:0 "In the Great War, thousand of patriotic Hungarian soldiers gave their lives for the House of Habsburg, whether it was on the river Izonzo or in the mountains of Carpathia, we must be sure to remind the people of their great sacrifice and heavily commit towards cultivating and expanding the military capability of Hungary, the sword and shield of the Dual-Monarchy in the East."
HUN_dual_monarchy:0 "Dual-Monarchy"
HUN_dual_monarchy_desc:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Compromise in 1867 transformed the Habsburg Monarchy into an alliance of two sovereign states. Each with its own constitution, government, and parliament. Leading up to the Third Ausgleich, there was much turmoil in Hungary, but Emperor Karl has healed the differences and unified both countries under his rule once again."

HUN_new_national_army:0 "The New Hungarian Army"
HUN_new_national_army_desc:0 "A wolf is no less a wolf because a whim of chance caused him to run with the watch-dogs. The Honvédség needs reform. Its poor performance during the Weltkrieg is a shameful indictment of Hungary's long partnership with Austria. Where are the glories of the Black Army? The conquering spirit of Arpad? What is the Hungarian army of the future?"
HUN_open_steppe:0 "The Open Steppe"
HUN_open_steppe_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg was fought for mere miles of trenches, a slugging match between masses of humanity. By the end of the war, however, new technology changed the playing field. Tanks and mechanized warfare. Supported most by German military theorists like Heinz Guderian, the manueverable, motorized army will dominate the next war. It is a type of warfare well-known to Hungarians of the Carpathian Basin."
HUN_a_fleet_horse:0 "A Fleet Horse"
HUN_a_fleet_horse_desc:0 "Fast, durable vehicles are critical for successful manuever warfare in the modern era. The Austro-Hungarian army of the Weltkrieg was large, but primitive. The Huns and Magyars who rode into Pannonia and made it their own were famous for their use of mobile armies and cavalry. If the Honvédség is to stand toe-to-toe with the great armies of Europe, it must develop new mode of mechanized cavalry."
HUN_falcon_wrist:0 "Falcons At Your Wrist"
HUN_falcon_wrist_desc:0 "A heavy push by mechanized force is not all that is not sufficient for victory. It must be combined with simultaneous domination of the air and mopping-up of resisting pockets. For Hungary's new mobile army to achieve total victory, it must have access to the best small arms and big guns available."
HUN_wind_hair:0 "Wind In Your Hair"
HUN_wind_hair_desc:0 "An important part of maneuver warfare is encirclement of the enemy. Dating back to the ancient world, our Hunnic ancestors would encircle Roman legions with mass cavalry envelopments. Today, the Hungarian army can accomplish similary feats with a tank rush and the surgical deployment of paratroop divisions to cut off key points of retreat."
HUN_crush_your_enemies:0 "Crush Your Enemies"
HUN_crush_your_enemies_desc:0 "The German military theory of /Schwerpunkt/ or 'Focal Point' is critical for modern maneuver warfare. Our army must be focused on the Focal Point, ready to break through and take control. To do this, we require armored cavalry, the dominant power of the modern battlefield. Engineers hired from Austria and Germany will develop the new Hungarian battle-tank."
HUN_driven_before_you:0 "See Them Driven Before You"
HUN_driven_before_you_desc:0 "Fast-moving mobile forces seize the initiative, exploite weaknesses and act before opposing forces can respond. We must trust in our experienced officers to know the intent of our generals and outmaneuver the enemy as they come upon them. Disorganized and with so many crucial areas within our control, the enemy must flee or be encircled!"
HUN_magyar_scout_association:0 "Magyar Cserkészszövetség"
HUN_magyar_scout_association_desc:0 "The Hungarian Scout Association is the primary national Scouting organization of Hungary. Young men trained to scale Hungary's mountains and hike its valleys will be recruited into a new division of the Honvédség, focused on special operations. Rangers and sappers are yet another key to victory on the modern battlefield, and these men know how to live off the land."
HUN_language_training:0 "Language Training"
HUN_language_training_desc:0 "The Honvédség suffered due to its reliance on Army Slavic, a rump language consisting of about eighty key words, mostly of Czech origin. While Hungarian was the official language of the army, half of the soldiery was recruited from areas that spoke various Slavic languages. The Hungarian army of the modern era cannot rely upon such ineffective compromises. All soldiers must be trained in Hungarian."
HUN_logistics_initiative:0 "Logistics Initiative"
HUN_logistics_initiative_desc:0 "The mechanization of warfare, starting at the tail-end of the Weltkrieg, added increasing ammo, fuel, and maintenance needs of tanks and other combat vehicles to the burden on military logistics. On the other hand, mechanization also brought trucks to logistics; though they generally require better roads and bridges, trucks are much faster and far more efficient than fodder-bound horse-drawn transport."
HUN_black_army:0 "The Black Army"
HUN_black_army_desc:0 "Matthias Corvinus, great king of Hungary, first conceived of a professional, standing army following his juvenile readings of Julius Caesar. The men of the Black Army were purely devoted to the art of warfare and succeeded in conquering large parts of Austria and Bohemia. Hungary must look to this example of martial excellence; drilled and disciplined soldiers will overcome superior numbers."
HUN_foreign_advisors:0 "Invite Foreign Advisors"
HUN_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "The original Black Army was largely made up of Germans, Bohemians, and Poles; foreign veterans with years of experience in their countries' wars. That won't do for the modern Honvédség, but advisors from the victors of the Weltkrieg, such as the Kaiserreich, should be invited to impart their wisdom to Hungary's military leaders."
HUN_only_the_best:0 "Only the Best"
HUN_only_the_best_desc:0 "If the Honvédség is to defeat the greater numbers of the Communards, the Russians, or even the German Empire, it must be supplied with the finest and most advanced infantry equipment known to man. Diverting funding to military research and development will ensure that the Hungarian infantryman is more than a match for his rivals on the battlefield."
HUN_thunder_and_lightning:0 "Thunder & Lightning"
HUN_thunder_and_lightning_desc:0 "War is no longer simply a matter of men clashing with steel on lonely battlefields. Big guns, with the power to level entire cities, are required to win the day. Veritable hammers of the gods, capable of pounding the enemy to smithereens. Just as the Black Army revolutionized European warfare with its incorporation of firearms, so will the new Black Army revolutionize modern artillery."
HUN_mechanical_hussars:0 "Mechanical Hussars"
HUN_mechanical_hussars_desc:0 "The hussars, one of Hungary's most famous contributions to military history, defined the early modern battlefield in Eastern and Central Europe. Their field of operation was scouting, securing, prowling, cutting enemy supply lines, and disarraying them in battle. Similarly, motorized hussars will capture weak points, encircle the enemy, and plunge into breaches in the enemy line."
HUN_gorlice_tarnow:0 "The Legacy of Gorlice–Tarnów"
HUN_gorlice_tarnow_desc:0 "Austria-Hungary was humiliated during the Weltkrieg. We suffered appalling losses during the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive to push the Russians out of Carpathia. Only with the help of German artillery and superior firepower did we finally overcome the Russians' numbers. This lesson is well-remembered and the key to Hungary's martial strength in the future."
HUN_army_recruitment:0 "Unified Army Recruitment"
HUN_army_recruitment_desc:0 "Divisions of the Honvédség are recruited from the various regions of Hungary, resulting in lack-lustre numbers from minority areas, as well as platoons with more loyalty to their hometowns than to Hungary itself. The recruitment apparatus must be reformed, both to unify recruitment standards across Transleithania and to ensure loyalty to Hungary above all."
HUN_military_funding:0 "Revive Military Funding"
HUN_military_funding_desc:0 "The Austro-Hungarian military machine was defective in many ways, but perhaps most in the methods it used to fund its military. With rival governments in Vienna and Budapest, the independence-minded parties of Hungary frequently devalued military funding to penalize the imperial plans of Austria. These decisions proved foolish and myopic during the Weltkrieg and post-war period."
HUN_new_technology:0 "New Warfighting Technology"
HUN_new_technology_desc:0 "In addition to suffering from lack of funds, the Honvédség never received the most advanced military technology. It took a full year into the Weltkrieg before the Austro-Hungarian military switched from the bright, baby-blue uniforms of the pre-war period to something more sensible and grey. Money must be reserved to repair the primitive state of the Hungarian army."
HUN_hordes_of_the_east:0 "Hordes of the East"
HUN_hordes_of_the_east_desc:0 "Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural. It is a whim of circumstance. And barbarism must always ultimately triumph. It was not technology or strategy that let the Goths and Vandals and Huns tear down the Roman empire, but the human spirit, the will to conquer, and vast armies to do it."
HUN_definition_of_volunteer:0 "Expand the Definition of Volunteer"
HUN_definition_of_volunteer_desc:0 "Much of the Hungarian independence movement has long demanded an end to conscription, especially following the Weltkrieg, arguing that the Hungarian army ought to serve on a volunteer basis. We agree! But what really is a volunteer? If a man needs work, what right does he have to decline service in the army?"
HUN_quality_of_quantity:0 "The Quality of Quantity"
HUN_quality_of_quantity_desc:0 "Some say Quality over Quantity. But does not Quantity have a Quality all its own? Legions of men, marching in lock-step, will inevitably overwhelm even the most fortified citadel. Not even the marvels of modern warfare, like the machine gun and the tank, can compete with manpower. Our generals must focus on using our nation's great manpower supply."
HUN_commissars:0 "Cowards Will Be Shot"
HUN_commissars_desc:0 "I am a Commissar. I am empowered to deliver justice wherever I see it lacking. I am empowered to punish cowardice. I am granted the gift of total authority to judge, for the honour of Hungary, on the field of combat. Pain is temporary. Honour is forever. Glory to the first man to die!"
HUN_metal_mettle:0 "Metal and Mettle"
HUN_metal_mettle_desc:0 "Blood and flesh aren't enough in war. A horde of Zulu warriors could not defeat the march of the British Empire. But armed with steel to meet the British, Austrians, Germans, or any great empire of the time, the masses of Hungarian manpower will overcome."
HUN_live_forever:0 "Do You Want to Live Forever?"
HUN_live_forever_desc:0 "Better death than the ceaseless and everlasting urge, the fire that has burned the veins with bitter longing. It is not pleasant to come upon Death in a lonely place at midnight. Best to face her head-on, seeking glory, ready to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under your sandalled feet."
HUN_airforce_focus:0 "Magyar Légierő"
HUN_airforce_focus_desc:0 "Hungarian aviation was nearly non-existent during the Weltkrieg, comprised of a few training schools and factories. As the nations of Europe gear up for the next great war, it has become clear that army aviation will be a key pillar of warfare. Hungary must follow suit with the foundation of Magyar Légierő, the Hungarian Airforce."
HUN_close_air_support:0 "Raptors"
HUN_close_air_support_desc:0 "Close air support by dive bombers will support the army's attack on the Focal Point. Control of the air, and subsequent bombardment of the ground, softens up the enemy for the arrival of our armored spearhead."
HUN_strategic_destruction:0 "Wrath of God"
HUN_strategic_destruction_desc:0 "Rather than focus on support on the battlefield, the Hungarian airforce can win the war by defeating the enemy at home. Destroy his morale, economy, and ability to produce and transport material to the military theatre."
HUN_foreign_flyers:0 "Aviation Experts"
HUN_foreign_flyers_desc:0 "Hungary is not a nation of flyers, nor did it accomplish many great feats of aviation during the Weltkrieg. If Hungary is to develop modern aviation, it requires advisors from abroad: German aces and expatriots from Canada."
HUN_expand_airports:0 "Budaörs & Debrecen"
HUN_expand_airports_desc:0 "The state will construct new airports at Budaörs and Debrecen. Not only will these encourage tourism and international commerce, but they can be used to test, store, and supply Hungary's burgeoning airforce."
HUN_light_bombers:0 "Light Bomber Trials"
HUN_light_bombers_desc:0 "The Hungarian government has announced a national competition among airplane and motor-vehicle manufacturers to develop Hungary's next fleet of light bombers to support our military from the air."
HUN_fighter_trials:0 "Fighter Trials"
HUN_fighter_trials_desc:0 "Hungary understands the importance of air superiority, but lacks the skills and training to develop the best planes for air-to-air combat. Thus, an award is offered to any international manufacturer who can meet the needs of the Hungarian airforce for modern fighter aircraft."
HUN_heavy_bombers:0 "Heavy Bomber Trials"
HUN_heavy_bombers_desc:0 "Strategic bombing is the way of the future. Why waste millions of lives when you can bomb the enemy into submission? The Hungarian state will host a competition to develop long-range aircraft, ostensibly for civilian usage at Hungary's international airports... that can also be used to bomb far away cities."
HUN_navy_focus:0 "Magyar Haditengerészet"
HUN_navy_focus_desc:0 "The Hungarian Navy disappeared with the birth of that ill-begotten country known as Illyria during the Second Ausgleich. Suddenly, the naval tradition of the Magyars was forgotten, folded into the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine. With our rightful sovereignty over Croatia restored, we must hurry to build a new Magyar Haditengerészet."
HUN_trade_interdiction:0 "Trade Wars in the Adriatic"
HUN_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "Our navy is small by necessity, shrunken and confiscated as it was by the Austrians during the Ausgleich. Moreover, the Hungarians are naturally a land power. We should not seek to dominate the Mediterranean, but we can ensure that those in the Adriatic play by Hungarian rules with a fleet of smaller vessels."
HUN_large_navy:0 "Fight for the Mediterranean"
HUN_large_navy_desc:0 "A great power must be a naval power as well. If Hungary is to shine on the world stage, it must have a navy to dominate its oceanic backyard. With the Balkanization of Italy, France a Syndicalist hellhole, and the Ottomans bankrupt, Hungary has the opportunity to become the pre-eminent naval power of the Mediterranean."
HUN_destroyers:0 "Destroyers and Patrolships"
HUN_destroyers_desc:0 "Small vessels with the ability to control trade, lay mines, and detect enemy submersibles will give the Hungarian navy a fighting chance against the superior oceanic powers of Britain and France."
HUN_battleships:0 "Ironclads Again"
HUN_battleships_desc:0 "The Ironclad was a steam-propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century. It was the ship of the line of the last century. Hungary will return to the philosophy of great battleships with enormous guns to content with its rivals at sea."
HUN_pola_marine_base:0 "Pola Marine Base"
HUN_pola_marine_base_desc:0 "Pola was the main marine base and shipbuilding center of the Austrian empire, home to the majority of Austria's dreadnoughts. Its great shipyards can now be used to rebuild the Hungarian navy."
HUN_cattaro_base:0 "Cattaro Marine Base"
HUN_cattaro_base_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, Cattaro was one of the three main bases of the Austro-Hungarian navy, and home of the Austrian Fifth Fleet. At the time it was the site of fierce fighting between Montenegrin Slavs and the Austro-Hungarian empire. Now, it is in our hands again and ready for expansion."
HUN_shore_bombardment:0 "Amphibious Invasion"
HUN_shore_bombardment_desc:0 "Navies are used for more than contesting the sea and controlling trade. They also aid in amphibious invasion. If only the Austrians had focused more effort on sea-power, they could have avoided the horrific conflicts with Italy in the mountains and invaded the vulnerable peninsula from the sea!"

HUN_develop_minorities:0 "Develop Minority Areas"
HUN_develop_minorities_desc:0 "The Crownlands of St. Stephen are made up of many peoples. Though the Magyar descendents of Arpad are its overlords, the land is home to Romanians, Slovaks, Croatians, Serbs, Pechenegs, Cumans, even Germans! Historically, these areas were ignored by the government of Budapest, but more can be done."
HUN_transylvanian_steel:0 "Transylvania Steel"
HUN_transylvanian_steel_desc:0 "Transylvania is a core part of the Kingdom of Hungary, whence came the father of its greatest king, Matthias Corvinus.

HUN_develop_szekelyland:0 "Our Szekelyland Kin"
HUN_develop_szekelyland_desc:0 "Szekelyland is a pocket of Hungarian excellence in a sea of Romanian resistance. Centered around Marosvásárhely and entitled to their own administration since the 1870s, the central government should extend development projects to our Szekely brothers."
HUN_slovakian_mines:0 "Slovakian Mines"
HUN_slovakian_mines_desc:0 "The Slovaks are some of Hungary's most irrascible and disloyal minorities; constantly appealing to their Slavic brethren in Russia for aid. But the region's rich mines are invaluable to the Hungarian state."
HUN_slovakian_development:0 "Invest in the North"
HUN_slovakian_development_desc:0 "If Hungary is to win over the northern Slovak and Czech minorities, it must show dedication to their needs and interests. Investment in the northern crownlands will show a kinder face of the Magyars."
HUN_develop_banat:0 "Develop Banat"
HUN_develop_banat_desc:0 "The Banat has been a sovereign part of Hungary for almost a thousand years, subject to 150 years of Ottoman domination. A melting pot of Serbs, Romanians, and Hungarians, it is lusted after by the rebellious Kingdom of Serbia, despite their losses in the Weltkrieg."

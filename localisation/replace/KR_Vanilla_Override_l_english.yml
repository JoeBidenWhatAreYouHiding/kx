 EQ_MOD_SLOT_armor_type_slot_TITLE: "Armour Type"
 tank_riveted_armor: "Riveted Armour"
 tank_riveted_armor_desc: "Armour Plates bolted to the frame and held together by rivets driven into the edges. A very proven technology that is fairly cheap, but the riveted edges provide weakpoints in the armour and might hurt the crew if the rivets are hit."
 tank_cast_armor: "Cast Armour"
 tank_cast_armor_desc: "The entire Chassis, including armour, is cast as a single unit. An expensive and time-consuming process that allows for much thicker armour with fewer weakpoints."
 tank_welded_armor: "Welded Armour"
 tank_welded_armor_desc: "Armour plates are welded to the chassis. A faster process than casting, while still providing good protection."
 extra_ammo_storage_desc: "Additional racks of ready ammunition allow the tank to stay in the fight much longer without resupply. However, if the armour is penetrated, the results are likely to be catastrophic. This is particularly problematic when attacking."

 tank_high_velocity_cannon_desc: "A cannon specifically designed to achieve a high muzzle velocity. Using specialised ammunition, it has superb anti-armour characteristics, but its performance against soft targets suffers."
 tank_high_velocity_cannon_2_desc: "A cannon specifically designed to achieve a high muzzle velocity. Using specialised ammunition, it has superb anti-armour characteristics, but its performance against soft targets suffers."
 tank_high_velocity_cannon_3_desc: "A cannon specifically designed to achieve a high muzzle velocity. Using specialised ammunition, it has superb anti-armour characteristics, but its performance against soft targets suffers."

 tank_small_cannon_desc: "A small and cheap cannon, able to fire both anti-infantry and anti-armour rounds. Its small calibre limits its usefulness."
 tank_small_cannon_2_desc: "A small and cheap cannon, able to fire both anti-infantry and anti-armour rounds. Its small calibre limits its usefulness."
 tank_auto_cannon_desc: "Adapted from a fast-firing anti-air gun, this automatic cannon can lay down a hail of fire that is devastating to soft targets. The small calibre does limit its anti-armour performance."
 tank_auto_cannon_2_desc: "Adapted from a fast-firing anti-air gun, this automatic cannon can lay down a hail of fire that is devastating to soft targets. The small calibre does limit its anti-armour performance."
 tank_medium_howitzer_desc: "A medium field howitzer adapted to be mounted in a vehicle. Its primary purpose is indirect fire support against soft targets, but it can be fired directly at a target if necessary. Carrying only a small amount of armour-piercing ammunition, it is ill-suited for anti-tank work."
 tank_medium_howitzer_2_desc: "A medium field howitzer adapted to be mounted in a vehicle. Its primary purpose is indirect fire support against soft targets, but it can be fired directly at a target if necessary. Carrying only a small amount of armour-piercing ammunition, it is ill-suited for anti-tank work."
 tank_heavy_howitzer_desc: "A heavy field howitzer adapted to be mounted in a vehicle. Its primary purpose is indirect fire support against soft targets, but it can be fired directly at a target if necessary. Carrying only a small amount of armour-piercing ammunition, it is ill-suited for anti-tank work."
 tank_rocket_launcher_desc: "A multi-barrelled launcher for unguided, high-explosive rockets. The high volume of fire gives it excellent performance against soft targets, but even direct hits do little against armoured targets."
 tank_heavy_cannon_desc: "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armour penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldly to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."
 tank_heavy_cannon_2_desc: "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armour penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldly to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."
 tank_heavy_cannon_3_desc: "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armour penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldly to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."
 flamethrower_desc: "A device to project a stream of burning liquid. While very useful in urban combat and against fortifications, it offers no anti-armour capability and has to be used by a specially-trained crew in a separate unit to be effective."

 armor_tech_1: "Basic Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc: "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armour. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2: "Improved Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_3: "Advanced Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_4: "Modern Armour Protection"
 armor_tech_4_desc: "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armour. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
 armor_skirts: "Armour Skirts"
 engine_tech_2_desc: "With bigger guns and heavier armour, the new generation of tanks requires a more powerful engine to remain mobile."
 engine_tech_3_desc: "Mechanised warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our tanks are to carry modern weapons and enough armour to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorised infantry."

 armor_tech_1_tt: "Enables Armour Upgrade values of 5 and above."

 armor_tech_3_tt: "Enables Armour Upgrade values of 15 and above."
 armor_tech_4_tt: "Enables Armour Upgrade values of 18 and above."

 light_tank_chassis_desc: "A small and compact chassis, ideal for a cheap and light vehicle for duties such as reconnaissance and fire support. Its limited load capacity makes it unsuited for carrying heavy armour or large guns."
 amphibious_tank_chassis_desc: "A small tank hull specifically designed to float. To achieve this, strict limits have to be set on the size of the weapon and the thickness of the armour the vehicle carries."
 heavy_tank_chassis_desc: "A large chassis that can mount a heavy gun, thick armour, or both."
 super_heavy_tank_chassis_desc: "A gigantic vehicle, capable of mounting the heaviest armour and the biggest gun, but consequently fairly slow and unreliable."
 modern_tank_chassis_desc: "A modernised chassis that borrows heavily from previous medium tanks, but puts a much bigger emphasis on speed and manoeuvrability, while also allowing for more armour and bigger guns than usually carried on medium tanks. The result is a vehicle that can fill a wide variety of roles."

 tank_light_two_man_tank_turret_desc: "A turret that allows for two crew members to share the work of operating the armament and observing the situation. It still does not allow for an effective division of labour amongst the crew."
 tank_medium_two_man_tank_turret_desc: "A turret that allows for two crew members to share the work of operating the armament and observing the situation. It still does not allow for an effective division of labour amongst the crew."

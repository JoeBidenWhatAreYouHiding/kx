### Ideas ###
NGR_Clifford_Legacy:0 "The Clifford Constitution"
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_desc:0 "Our last administrator Hugh Clifford made many changes to our constitution, allowing for proper representational democracy for colonials and generally promoting a more indirect system of rule in Nigeria. It's no Westminster, but it is certainly making our country more stable."
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_Adm:0 "The Clifford Constitution"
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_Adm_desc:0 "Our last administrator Hugh Clifford made many changes to our constitution, allowing for proper representational democracy for colonials and generally promoting a more indirect system of rule in Nigeria. It's no Westminster, but it is certainly making our country more stable."
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_Mil:0 "The Clifford Constitution"
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_Mil_desc:0 "Our last administrator Hugh Clifford made many changes to our constitution, allowing for proper representational democracy for colonials and generally promoting a more indirect system of rule in Nigeria. It's no Westminster, but it is certainly making our country more stable."
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_Dip:0 "The Clifford Constitution"
NGR_Clifford_Legacy_Dip_desc:0 "Our last administrator Hugh Clifford made many changes to our constitution, allowing for proper representational democracy for colonials and generally promoting a more indirect system of rule in Nigeria. It's no Westminster, but it is certainly making our country more stable."
NGR_Northern_Tensions:0 "Northern Tensions"
NGR_Northern_Tensions_desc:0 "The German colonization has done much to destabilize the north. Religious tensions are at an all time high as Islamic militants in Hausaland wage holy jihad against our government."
NGR_administrative_efficiency:0 "Administrative Efficiency"
NGR_administrative_efficiency_descc:0 "With Twining back in power, he is prepared to bring greater efficiency to Nigeria, with the help of British administrators, while simultaneously working towards greater native autonomy."
NGR_nigerian_identity:0 "A Nigerian Identity"
NGR_nigerian_identity_desc:0 "Azikiwe has done the unthinkable and come to power with a nationalist message. Now he will work to free Nigeria of foreign greed and inspire a new sense of nationalism in his people."
NGR_army_reforms:0 "Army Reforms"
NGR_army_reforms_desc:0 "Stockwell has won the election and now hopes to revamp the Nigerian military to be far more efficient and perhaps even in line with German tactics and organization. This will take some work, but he is confident that he can accomplish this goal in his new position in power."
NGR_free_trade_idea:0 "Free Trade"
NGR_free_trade_idea_desc:0 "We should aim to liberalize the economy, as the British did in their prime. By encouraging greater trade with our neighbors and even nations on other continents, our markets will prosper and money will fill our pockets."
NGR_central_bank_idea:0 "Nigerian Central Bank"
NGR_central_bank_idea_desc:0 "The idea of a central bank is not unique to Nigeria, and we have closely studied its implementation elsewhere. For a more efficient economy, we must create a Nigerian Central Bank, and we can only grow as a result of it."
NGR_home_army:0 "A New Home Army"
NGR_home_army_desc:0 "Like the British Army of old, Nigeria must have a home army. To do this, we will model ourselves after the old British model, while also using our new law code to help impose some forms of conscription. Soon we will have the best army in all of Afrika!"
NGR_allow_native_volunteers:0 "Native Volunteers"
NGR_allow_native_minor:0 "Minor Conscription"
NGR_allow_native_major:0 "Major Conscription"

NGR_angry_colonials_4:0 "Extended Colonial Business Dealings"
NGR_deal_with_rebels:0 "Dealing With Rebels"
NGR_deal_with_rebels_desc:0 "The rebels to the north have been a thorn in our side for too long. It has time they were dealt with, once and for all!"
NGR_deal_with_rebels_2:0 "Dealing With Rebels"
NGR_deal_with_rebels_2_desc:0 "Our fight against the northern rebels has been going well; it won't be long now until we have them on the run!"
NGR_deal_with_rebels_3:0 "Triumph in the North"
NGR_deal_with_rebels_3_desc:0 "We have extinguished the worst of the rebel groups to our north, paving the way for a stable Nigeria for generations to come!"
NGR_prussian_example:0 "Emulate the Prussians"
NGR_prussian_example_desc:0 "For decades, if not centuries, the Prussians have had the most competent military in the world. Now that they are our overlords and we have the ability to do so, we should seek to emulate them."
NGR_german_instructors:0 "German Instructors"
NGR_curb_british:0 "Weakened British Influence"
NGR_curb_british_desc:0 "The British are a thorn in the side of our administration. Seeing themselves as above the Africans and sometimes even the Germans, they have often refused to cooperate with our government, especially financially. It is time to end this problem."
NGR_curb_british_2:0 "German Trade Deals"
NGR_curb_british_2_desc:0 "Though some argue we are replacing one overlord for another with our new German trade deals, the Germans are clearly much better partners than the British. They do not demand exemption from any financial obligations, and they are willing to pay fair prices for our products. Even better, they don't live here."
NGR_french_aid:0 "Entente Aid"
NGR_french_aid_desc:0 "We have reached out to the Entente for aid, and our request has been granted! This is the first step in fostering closer relations with our old allies."
NGR_nigerian_people_aid:0 "The People's Government"
NGR_nigerian_people_aid_desc:0 "We have no need for foreign rulers; we have appealed to the Nigerian people for aid instead! With their help, we will gain independence before we know it."
NGR_nigerian_assistance:0 "Nigerian Aid"
NGR_nigerian_assistance_desc:0 "The Nigerians, under the loyal Bernard Bourdillon, have sent us much needed supplies to help in this time of great crisis. They aren't much, but we appreciate the gesture nonetheless!"
NGR_Class_Divisions:0 "Native-Colonial Divide"
NGR_Class_Divisions_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the Nigeria colony, there have been tensions between the European settler population and the various native Nigerian tribes. These tensions still characterize politics in the colony today, and as natives increasingly lobby for equal rights, so too do the settlers entrench themselves in their position in favor of an unequal colony."
NGR_Class_Divisions_Improved:0 "Softened Class Divisions"
NGR_Class_Divisions_Improved_desc:0 "We have agreed to grant the Nigerian natives certain additional rights, such as easier access to education, but we have not gone so far as to grant them the full extent of the rights enjoyed by colonials. For now, this will hopefully satisfy the Nigerian people."
NGR_Class_Divisions_Equal:0 "Nigerian Equality"
NGR_Class_Divisions_Equal_desc:0 "We have decided to grant full equality to the Nigerian people, putting them on par with the colonials in every way. This has come with certain benefits, such as more manpower for research into diseases and even morale boosts for Nigerian workers, but it will also anger the European settlers."
NGR_curb_brits:0 "Reduced British Influence"
NGR_curb_brits_desc:0 "The British have had a stranglehold on Nigeria's economy for too long! We must crush their influence if we hope to develop our economy; they only hold us back with their greed. And, by reducing their influence, we can open the door for new German investments..."
NGR_curb_brits_2:0 "New German Influence"
NGR_curb_brits_2_desc:0 "With the British influence weakened, the country is now ripe for German investment. Already German companies are flooding into the colony, ready to do business, and soon the economy shall be run by Germans, not the British settlers."
NGR_righteous_cause:0 "A Righteous Cause"
NGR_Spiritual_War_Idea:0 "Spiritual Warfare"
NGR_Spiritual_War_Idea_desc:0 "Recently, the tensions between the north and south of Nigeria have only worsened. The government has given us the green light to proceed with a sort of "spiritual warfare" in the north to try and restore security. This will unite our troops for the time being, but we cannot hope to beat a religion in a war. Such open warfare can only be temporary, until we find a better solution..."
NGR_federalism_idea:0 "Federal System"
NGR_federalism_idea_desc:0 "With a system that gives representation to both the Yoruba and the Igbo, we will have a much more secure state, and can face both the northerners and any outside forces more efficiently."
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Neighbors:0 "Appeals to our Neighbors"
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Neighbors_desc:0 "The German colonization has done much to destabilize the north. Religious tensions are at an all time high as Islamic militants in Hausaland wage holy jihad against our government. Luckily, Westafrika and Kenya have agreed to provide some limited aid, but this will not fully solve our crisis."
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Soldiers:0 "Mercenary Contracts"
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Soldiers_desc:0 "The German colonization has done much to destabilize the north. Religious tensions are at an all time high as Islamic militants in Hausaland wage holy jihad against our government. Luckily, we have secured contracts with mercenary groups. While these will provide some limited aid, they cannot fully solve our crisis."
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Reich:0 "Mittelafrikan Help"
NGR_Northern_Tensions_Reich_desc:0 "The German colonization has done much to destabilize the north. Religious tensions are at an all time high as Islamic militants in Hausaland wage holy jihad against our government. Luckily, Mittelafrika has agreed to assist us, but they cannot solve our crisis for us. More must be done."
NGR_at_islam_idea:0 "Striking at Islam!"
NGR_at_lawlessness_idea:0 "Combatting Anarchy!"
NGR_at_dissent_idea:0 "Addressing the Dissenters!"
NGR_northern_solution:0 "The Northern Solution"
NGR_northern_solution_desc:0 "We have finally come to an agreement with the Muslims in the north and can now say that Nigeria is stable once more. Though we may not have much, we are more united than ever, and that is the first step to our national prosperity."
NGR_northern_solution_peace:0 "A United Nigeria"
NGR_northern_solution_peace_desc:0 "With Nigeria fully under our control, we can now look towards a better future and we can perhaps focus on our neighbors..."
NGR_northern_solution_twostates:0 "Two States"
NGR_northern_solution_twostates_desc:0 "Nigeria was never meant to last. We have split into two states, and we shall prosper without the northerners holding us back!"

### Focuses ###
NGR_followtheprussianexample:0 "Follow the Prussian Example"
NGR_followtheprussianexample_desc:0 "The Prussian army has the peak performance of any army in the world, with their complete command over the tactics of professionalism and cohesion. We should work toward following such an example and make sure the Nigerian army is the best colonial army in Afrika."
NGR_reformthejudicialsystem:0 "Reform The Judicial System"
NGR_reformthejudicialsystem_desc:0 "As it stands, our judicial system is outdated. As dark clouds begin gathering in Mittelafrika, it only makes sense that we begin working on reforming the system. We will make sure it deals with the law better, for we may have to deal with it alone soon."
NGR_anewhomearmy:0 "A New Home Army"
NGR_anewhomearmy_desc:0 "The 'Home Army' was the term for the British army back before the collapse. While our own army still has a mainly colonial-style, it is past time we started modernizing the army so that we can be better at fighting threats, domestic and abroad. Most importantly, we must create a loyal armed force."
NGR_3rdnigerianparliamentelection:0 "3rd Nigerian Parliament Election"
NGR_3rdnigerianparliamentelection_desc:0 "When the Nigerian free state was conceived, the leadership was always elected through parliament. Now, as time goes on, the third parliamentary election of the Nigerian free state is beginning, and three figures have risen. Who will win, though, is yet to be seen..."
NGR_cliffordslegacy:0 "Clifford's Legacy"
NGR_cliffordslegacy_desc:0 "When Hugh Clifford governed Nigeria, he instituted many beneficial programs, the most important of which involved education and administration. In education, he aimed to establish primary schools for every child, training colleges in every province, and even a royal college in the region. Administratively, Clifford made every attempt to westernize the region, and his work paid off. We should continue his legacy and go further, allowing representative democracy and indirect rule in Nigeria."
NGR_spiritualwarfare:0 "Spiritual Warfare"
NGR_spiritualwarfare_desc:0 "One of the largest obstacles to a united Nigeria is our religious divide. Tensions have only risen in recent years, and relations between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria have come to a head in the form of spiritual warfare. This warfare does not bode well for our stability..."
NGR_kinginexile:0 "King in Exile"
NGR_kinginexile_desc:0 "The British king was our king as well once, and we have decided to make him our sovereign once again. However, the last few decades have been difficult for the king; he lives in exile in Canada, his homeland stolen from him. We must ally ourselves with the Entente and help restore the king to his rightful place!"
NGR_pathtowestafrika:0 "Path to Westafrika"
NGR_pathtowestafrika_desc:0 "One of our most important neighbors is Westafrika, but this also means we must deal with them. We should send an offer of closer ties to them, an offer that could take many dimensions but one that must be to the benefit of both nations if it is to be accepted. What should we offer them?"
NGR_pragmaticprotectionism:0 "Pragmatic Protectionism"
NGR_pragmaticprotectionism_desc:0 "Berlin was our overlord once, and perhaps they can offer us protection once more. Despite the collapse of Mittelafrika, it seems that they are still the strongest nation on Earth, and aligning ourselves with them could bring us certain benefits, especially military. Should we stay loyal, if only for pragmatic reasons?"
NGR_twostates:0 "Two States"
NGR_twostates_desc:0 "We have decided to pursue a two state system. This will remove the northern half of our country from our control, but perhaps this is for the best, as the region has only been trouble for our administration. Only time will tell what the future of Nigeria will hold..."
NGR_atrulyfreestate:0 "A Truly Free State"
NGR_atrulyfreestate_desc:0 "The Germans and the British are vultures, only seeking to exploit us while providing little in return for our loyalty. We have no need for their control; instead, we will forge our own path on the world stage. Nigeria will finally be a free state, and we will set an example that all of Afrika can behold."
NGR_obrittania:0 "O Brittania"
NGR_obrittania_desc:0 "We were once loyal to the British Empire, which spanned the world only a few decades ago. Now, Canada is the head of a much-diminished Entente, but aligning ourselves with them has its own benefits. They have promised us resources and aid that Germany never bothered to offer, and we are inclined to believe them; our support will be crucial in any war in Afrika. Shall we reach out with our offer?"
NGR_thecommander:0 "The Commander"
NGR_thecommander_desc:0 "In the third parliamentary election, the pro-German National Front Party has managed to achieve victory. Sir Bernard Henry Bourdillon, famous for his linguistic skills and his administrative experience across the former British Empire, will now lead Nigeria towards a new, more German and militaristic future."
NGR_splittingattheseams:0 "Splitting at the Seams"
NGR_splittingattheseams_desc:0 "Nigeria is a nation in turmoil: the north is in revolt, our law system is falling apart, and worst of all, there is little to no help from Berlin. We must come up with creative solutions to the crisis at hand if we hope to survive as a colony and as a nation."
NGR_intensifypacificationcampaign:0 "Intensify Pacification Campaign"
NGR_intensifypacificationcampaign_desc:0 "We have the rebels on the run. They did not expect the military response that the government has given, and now the only thing we have to do is intensify the campaign and finally end them, once and for all."
NGR_anigeriancentralbank:0 "A Nigerian Central Bank"
NGR_anigeriancentralbank_desc:0 "As Nigeria develops a market economy, it is quite clear we need to create a central bank. This will allow our capitalists to store and withdraw money if necessary. After all, they will need it for their projects, and Nigeria is booming."
NGR_allownativesintothearmy:0 "Allow Natives into the army"
NGR_allownativesintothearmy_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the British collapse, the Nigerian army was primarily composed of White colonists and Askari divisions. However, with Native rights being expanded, it makes sense that we should begin letting natives into the army as well. This will give us the manpower we need to fight off another revolt, should it occur."
NGR_fromlagostosokoto:0 "From Lagos to Sokoto"
NGR_fromlagostosokoto_desc:0 "It is not uncommon for outsiders to underestimate the size of Nigeria, but they do so at their own peril. Nigeria is truly massive, but we aim to govern it in its entirety. The first step to doing so will be to establish infrastructure, beginning with a new road connecting Lagos and Sokoto."
NGR_dealwiththenorthernrebel:0 "Deal with the Northern Rebellion"
NGR_dealwiththenorthernrebel_desc:0 "For years since the collapse, the Muslim north has proved to be a pest on the Nigerian government. However, they have pestered us one time too many, and now the government will finally end this pest once and for all."
NGR_movetowardsfederalism:0 "Move Towards Federalism"
NGR_movetowardsfederalism_desc:0 "Moving towards a federal system in Nigeria will stabilize our regime significantly. This is because the nature of federalism, with its states and tiers of administration, is best suited for a diverse country like our own. It will also help quell any revolts before they even begin, as all regions of the country will have representation."
NGR_theanglo:0 "The Anglo"
NGR_theanglo_desc:0 "To the surprise of no one, the third parliamentary election has ended with the pro-Anglo party, commonly known as the Tory-Whig Union Party, achieving victory once more. Edward Twining, an Anglo administrator, has returned after being out of power for years, and will now once again take the reins and carry on the path of the TWU."
NGR_callingermaninstructors:0 "Call in German Instructors"
NGR_callingermaninstructors_desc:0 "As our army becomes a professional force, we have found ourselves needing good commanders and officers more than anything else. As such, we shall contact the homeland and ask for some German instructors and officers to improve our military might in West Afrika."
NGR_curbbritisheconomicalinfluence:0 "Curb British Economical Influence"
NGR_curbbritisheconomicalinfluence_desc:0 "Even as it was integrated into Mittelafrika, the British capitalist elite held a tight grip on the Nigerian economy, as it does to this day. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue; if we want to truly reap the benefits of our overlord, we must curb its influence."
NGR_unpegthenigerianpoundfromthemark:0 "Untangle The Nigerian Pound From The Mark"
NGR_unpegthenigerianpoundfromthemark_desc:0 "The Nigerian Pound has been unpegged from the Mittelafrikan Mark as part of the deal. Indeed, the government hopes to separate the currencies entirely and finally let the Nigerian Pound float freely."
NGR_thenative:0 "The Native"
NGR_thenative_desc:0 "In an election that has shocked the nation, the party of Nnamdi Azikiwe, the National Council of Nigeria, has achieved what was thought to be possible and has come on top. Nnamdi Azikiwe, a native statesman, hopes to rid the nation of colonialist taint as much as possible while pushing for a unified Nigerian identity."
NGR_nigerianvolunteerforce:0 "Nigerian Volunteer Force"
NGR_nigerianvolunteerforce_desc:0 "We have pledged our support to the king in Canada, and now it is time to make good on our promise. The Nigerian volunteer force will serve the interests of the Entente in Afrika and elsewhere. With this support, the Entente will prevail!"
NGR_theyneedus:0 "They Need Us"
NGR_theyneedus_desc:0 "Westafrika's strength is roughly equal to our own, and as such, they need us and we need them. However, their existence is perhaps even more threatened than ours; their wealth of gold makes them an attractive target to any would-be colonizer. They need us, and we should use this to our advantage."
NGR_thebornuquestion:0 "The Bornu Question"
NGR_thebornuquestion_desc:0 "Bornu is a region at the very outskirts of our country, and it has oftentimes been more trouble than it is worth. Still, it is a useful buffer, and it is better for us to control it than our neighbors. At the same time, we would have much to gain by offering it to these same neighbors. Nigeria stands at a crossroads..."
NGR_atlawlessness:0 "At Lawlessness"
NGR_atlawlessness_desc:0 "Anarchy reigns supreme in Nigeria, though this has not always been the case. We must restore some semblance of order if we are to survive and prosper. Only by placing power in the hands of local administrators can we hope to achieve this."
NGR_loyaltyquestions:0 "Loyalty Questions"
NGR_loyaltyquestions_desc:0 "Now that our overlords have lost control, we must decide where our loyalties lay. Should we stay loyal to the Germans, seek out our old overlords, or go our own way?"
NGR_atislam:0 "At Islam"
NGR_atislam_desc:0 "Islam is the root of all the northern dissent, and thus, it must be dealt with. Targeting an entire faith will be unpopular, not just at home, but in the Muslim World as well. Nonetheless, such a direct measure may be the only way to solve our problem."
NGR_ourfellowprotectorates:0 "Our Fellow Protectorates"
NGR_ourfellowprotectorates_desc:0 "The best course of action to solve our national crisis would be to appeal to our fellow protectorates. Our neighbors have their own troubles, but if we can work together, perhaps we can quell our respective troublemakers together. We should send word of our perils at once."
NGR_atdissent:0 "At Dissent"
NGR_atdissent_desc:0 "The reason we have such chaos in our country to begin with is that our citizens have unmet needs and desires. We should try to address these concerns, in the hopes that this will finally resolve the disputes. The first concern we must address is that of administration; the northern states want more autonomy. We must grant them this..."
NGR_apermanentsolution:0 "A Permanent Solution?"
NGR_apermanentsolution_desc:0 "On closer examination, it seems our problem is unsolvable without changing how the state itself is run. Two solutions have been presented to us. With a one state solution, we could wield more influence in the region and generally prosper, but only if we can find a satisfying compromise to the current crisis. On the other hand, a two state solution would leave us divided, but our crisis would be solved once and for all, and we could rest easy."
NGR_sidelinetheparliament:0 "Sideline The Parliament"
NGR_sidelinetheparliament_desc:0 "Nnamdi has shown a desire to simplify bureaucracy, and the parliament is a clear example of a bureaucratic system. As such, Nmandi and his party will work toward sidelining and puppeting the parliament so that his will can be pushed into the government without pushback, for Nigeria is for the Nigerians and no colonials and red tape can be allowed to get in the way of this."
NGR_callinaemergencyparliamentmeeting:0 "Call An Emergency Parliament Meeting"
NGR_callinaemergencyparliamentmeeting_desc:0 "As time rolls by, the new government has imposed impressive changes onto the Nigerian government. With their reforms mostly completed, they will now call an emergency parliament meeting, in order to discuss Nigeria and its future."
NGR_ourfirststrike:0 "Our First Strike?"
NGR_ourfirststrike_desc:0 "Now that we have secured outside aid and gathered our own resources, it is time to decide how we will tackle our internal dissent. We could target Islam itself, try to restore order in our Northern territories, or try to address the concerns of the dissenting groups. What shall we do?"
NGR_theneworder:0 "The New Order"
NGR_theneworder_desc:0 "It is a new day in Nigeria; we have shrugged off the German chains and now must decide our fate. We could appeal to the British or the Germans for some aid, or fully embrace our freedom. We must also consider the question of Westafrika, and how we should interact with that regime. Finally, the Bornu region merits consideration in our new nation."
NGR_theafrikanreich:0 "The Afrikan Reich"
NGR_theafrikanreich_desc:0 "Appealing to the Afrikan Reich is our best bet for aid, as they are the most powerful force on the whole continent. Their forces could swiftly crush the Muslim rebels, and the funds they can offer would be more than enough to solve our troubles. However, such aid could come with unwanted scrutiny and control from Göring and his administrators, so we should consider this option carefully before taking it."
NGR_thesoldiermarket:0 "The Soldier Market"
NGR_thesoldiermarket_desc:0 "There is a widespread but often ignored mercenary market in Afrika. Appealing to them for aid is the best solution if we want to confront local strife head-on, but it will come at a cost. Are we willing to pay for stability?"
NGR_someoutsidehelp:0 "Some Outside Help?"
NGR_someoutsidehelp_desc:0 "The situation in Nigeria seems untenable, at least for our administration. However, if we appeal to outside sources for aid and explain the situation, we are sure to find some sort of relief, though we must decide who this aid will come from."
NGR_openbarrierforgermancompanies:0 "Remove The Barriers On German Companies"
NGR_openbarrierforgermancompanies_desc:0 "With the influence of the Nigerian-British capitalists gone, we can now finally allow German companies into Nigeria and reap the profits the British capitalists have been too cowardly to secure."
NGR_expandthenativerights:0 "Expand the Native Rights"
NGR_expandthenativerights_desc:0 "It is very clear that, as it currently stands, the natives are not actually that free in Nigeria. However, with the election now finished, the government is now looking at finally fixing this problem and giving the natives the rights they truly deserve."
NGR_liberalizetheeconomy:0 "Liberalize the Economy"
NGR_liberalizetheeconomy_desc:0 "As it stands, most of the economy has been given to state-run companies, and this cannot stand. Too much money is going into something that we could cut the cost of, letting the market decide instead, and that is something we must do."
NGR_onestate:0 "One State"
NGR_onestate_desc:0 "We will consolidate our territories into one state once and for all. This will not be easy for northern dissidents to accept, but we now have what we need to suppress them should they cause trouble. Towards a bright future for Nigeria!"
NGR_butweneedthemmore:0 "...But We Need Them More"
NGR_butweneedthemmore_desc:0 "We are not in a position to make demands of Westafrika. Instead, we should make an offer that they will view as favorable, in the hopes they will accept. This could include favorable trading laws or a gift of equipment but we must do something if we want them to accept."

nig.2.t:0 "Third Parliamentary Election"
nig.2.d:0 "The time has now come for the third parliamentary election in Nigeria. As it happens, there are also three parties who stand a chance at victory. The Union Party candidate, Edward Twining, hopes to return to power, power which he once held over the region. Twining is popularly known as 'the Anglo' for his representation of British interests within Nigeria and the party he represents, which is inspired by the old Tory and Whig parties. Nnamdi Azikiwe is the candidate for the National Council of Nigeria, otherwise known as the Nigerian Front. Azikiwe, a journalist, is famous for his advocacy of Nigerian independence. The only native of the three, he hopes to free Nigeria of its German and British yolk once and for all. Finally, there is Hugh Stockwell, who has British roots and yet has thrown in his lot with the Germans. Representing the National Front Party, otherwise known as the Nigerian National Democratic Party, Stockwell hopes to bring Nigeria closer to the German motherland, while also pursuing more militaristic policies. Who shall win?"
nig.2.a:0 "The Anglo."
nig.2.b:0 "The Native."
nig.2.c:0 "The Commander."

nig.3.t:0 "A Nationwide Lawcode?"
nig.3.d:0 "The various disparate tribal groups of Nigeria, especially in the North, have always practiced their own laws and customs, but this is an ineffective system. For one, many do not see us as having the authority to adjudicate within their tribes or villages. Even worse, the inconsistent laws mean that a man can murder someone in one town and escape punishment in another. This is absurd. There are two main solutions that have been proposed to handle this issue: We could reform the system and make it applicable to southern tribes for now, which will be easier for us to accomplish but perhaps less efficient. On the other hand, we could also impose our laws on the north, which would cause a backlash but could be better at achieving our goals in the end. Choose wisely..."
nig.3.a:0 "A National Law System."
nig.3.b:0 "A Unified Southern System."

nig.4.t:0 "Expanding Native Rights"
nig.4.d:0 "There have been several different plans in the making to expand native rights in Nigeria, but politicians have vehemently disagreed on what the nature of such expansions should be. The Unionists, led by Edward Twining, have argued for the expansion of the Nigerian Legislative Council to the north of the country, so that it is more geographically representative. However, the Nationalists, led by Nnamdi Azikiwe and Herbert Macaulay, instead insist on greater African representation overall in these councils. They accuse the Unionists of trying to divide-and-conquer under the guise of giving rights to all Nigerians. Meanwhile, the Unionists have accused the Nationalists of trying to completely undermine British influence in the nation, something that is not entirely untrue. The Nigerian NDP, the Collaborationists, have largely stayed out of this debate, believing in neither position. We must decide what to do."
nig.4.a:0 "The Macaulay Plan."
nig.4.b:0 "The Twining Plan."

nig.5.t:0 "Allow Natives into the Army?"
nig.5.d:0 "In recent years, we have suffered manpower shortages, owing to a lack of European and Askari men. It is the perfect opportunity for those advocating increased inclusion of natives into the army; proponents of this have pushed for various plans that we now must choose from. We could allow natives to volunteer to join the army, giving us perhaps less men but surely helping our army overall. We could also go further and implement some conscription of natives into the army, which represents the furthest position the Unionists are comfortable with. However, the Nationalists are pushing for an even larger program of conscription, less so as a way of using natives as much as it is a way of making the army mostly Nigerian in makeup."
nig.5.a:0 "Allow volunteer forces."
nig.5.b:0 "Impose minor conscription."
nig.5.c:0 "Impose major conscription."

nig.6.t:0 "Azikiwe Sidelines Parliament!"
nig.6.d:0 "In recent months, Azikiwe and his Nationalists have grown increasingly frustrated at the unwillingness of parliament to cooperate with his regime. Most recently, Azikiwe's attempts to simplify bureaucracy within the nation have been met with threats and filibustering. The time has come for a change: Azikiwe will sideline parliament altogether. This will allow the party to implement some of its desired reforms, but our advisors warn that such a gesture will greatly anger the Europeans living within our colony. Still, Azikiwe has urged us to move forward with this action, and insists that the Europeans will come around eventually and make a deal with us."
nig.6.a:0 "Colonials are Furious!"

nig.7.t:0 "Court Liberal Colonists"
nig.7.d:0 "The first step to mending the rift between the Nigerian government and the colonists is to reach out to more liberally-minded colonists. These colonists will be the most likely to be in favor of Nigerian rights and governance, and if we offer them new positions and increased influence, so long as they cooperate, we are certain they will go along with it. Let us proceed with this plan."
nig.7.a:0 "They will come around!"

nig.8.t:0 "Pragmatic German Colonists"
nig.8.d:0 "While most of the European colonists in our country are of British descent, there are also some German colonists here and there. These colonists have more influence with the motherland than the British ones do, and are thus important for us to win over. They are also less prideful than the British, having been in the region for less time. We believe that by offering certain benefits, especially economic ones, to the Germans, we can regain the support we lost by sidelining parliament."
nig.8.a:0 "Make the offer!"

nig.9.t:0 "Tensions Calm Down"
nig.9.d:0 "It has been months now since Azikiwe sidelined parliament in the pursuit of his own goals, and time has mended the wounds caused by this act. However, there are still many colonials who are deeply unsatisfied with our regime, and have chosen to leave rather than stay under what they see as an oppressive regime. Azikiwe has welcomed this, and though the country will suffer somewhat from this emigration, we have fostered ties with enough colonials, as well as the Germans, to ensure that we can continue on."
nig.9.a:0 "Another victory for the Nigerian people!"

nig.10.t:0 "Rebels Weakened!"
nig.10.d:0 "After a long effort, it seems that our troops have finally driven off or otherwise dealt with the worst of the northern rebel groups, allowing us to work towards the unification of our diverse nation and perhaps towards more autonomy as well..."
nig.10.a:0 "Great!"

nig.11.t:0 "Nigeria Asks For German Instructors!"
nig.11.d:0 "We have received word from Nigeria today. It appears that their military is developing well, but they believe they will need more German instructors before they can fully modernize their military. Providing them with extra instructors and officers could help our stability on the continent, but it will be unpopular with our people. On the other hand, we could decline this offer without suffering many repercussions at home. What should we do?"
nig.11.a:0 "Send some officers!"
nig.11.b:0 "They can build their own military!"

nig.12.t:0 "Germany Declines!"
nig.12.d:0 "It appears that our recent request for more German instructors has been denied. While this is certainly a setback for our forces, our advisors insist that we don't need them, and that we will have to develop an army on our own. It is too bad that our supposed 'motherlord' refuses to help us when we need it most..."
nig.12.a:0 "Damn!"

nig.13.t:0 "Emergency Parliament Meeting!"
nig.13.d.brits:0 "We have accomplished many of our goals over the course of Twining's administration in Nigeria, but now our world is about to change altogether. The German heartland is on the precipice; their economy is in ruins, their empire is stretched thin, and their enemies crowd around them. Meanwhile, our overlords in Mittelafrika are not much better off. They have suffered from the Black Monday collapse as well, and their influence wanes every day in Nigeria. As such, we have called an emergency meeting in order to decide how we will react to these extraordinary circumstances. Our Unionists, being mainly either British colonists or British sympathizers, have called for us to cast off the German yolk once and for all and rejoin our old comrades in the Entente. However, such an action will be sure to anger both the Nationalists and the Collaborationists, and we must time it carefully. There are also many other issues that will need to be dealt with, including the rights of natives, the focus of future economic development, and our relationships with our neighbors, especially Westafrika and Kenya."
nig.13.d.native:0 "Today we have gathered in an emergency parliament meeting to decide the future of Nigeria. Our administration under the leadership of Nnamdi Azikiwe has taken several steps towards Nigerian independence, but the greatest factor contributing to our autonomy is not within Nigeria; it is in Germany. Our rulers are collapsing; the greatest empire on Earth is on its knees. Their lackeys in Mittelafrika are not much better off, and they are less of a threat than ever, their authority nearly irrelevant. This is the opportunity we have been waiting for, but Azikiwe urges caution. Declaring independence too soon will scare colonists who will either revolt or leave the country, and we should approach this issue with care. Further, we should not underestimate the Mittelafrikan military, nor the German navy. The Entente, the Third Internationale, the Americans; none of them are willing to help us; true independence will need to be gained alone. However, we should consider this a blessing. We have no need of a new colonial oppressor; instead, we will take matters into our own hands, when the time comes. For now, we must consider the relationships between natives and colonists, the focus of future economic development, and our relationships with our neighbours."
nig.13.d.germs:0 "The German Empire is in crisis! Our motherland is experiencing the worst economic crisis in history, and Mittelafrika's authority is collapsing. As such, Bernard H. Bourdillon has called an emergency parliament meeting to decide our colony's future. Our party, the National Front, rules Nigeria in the name of the Kaiser, but we will face stark opposition from both Azikiwe's Nationalists and the Unionists if we ignore our homeland to save Germany. Regardless, something must be done. Germany is suffering from economic instability, but it is also surrounded by enemies. To the extent we can ameliorate their situation, we should; sending them food, equipment, and troops is the least we could do. We must also decide how to handle increasing calls from the natives for equal rights, as well as the focus of our economic development and our relationships with our neighbors, particularly Mittelafrika proper."
nig.13.a:0 "We will find our footing!"

nig.14.t:0 "Diplomatic Overtures"
nig.14.d.brits:0 "We have reached out to the Entente, specifically Canada and France, in the hopes that we can establish some form of cooperation. They have been receptive to our offers so far, and have even offered to give us limited economic aid, an offer we gladly accepted. This is hopefully only the first step of many in recreating our old ties to the British Empire."
nig.14.d.native:0 "We have appealed to the whole of Nigeria to help us in our time of need, and they have answered our call. More men than ever are signing up for various forms of military service, and we will show the world our true might!"
nig.14.d.germs:0 "We have sent crucial aid to the Kaiser to help him keep his empire afloat. This is a gesture that shall not be forgotten anytime soon, and we hope it makes the difference. In the meantime, we are also looking to establish closer ties with the administration in Mittelafrika, and work to ensure stability on our continent."
nig.14.a:0 "Glory to the King!"
nig.14.b:0 "For Nigeria!"
nig.14.c:0 "For the Kaiser!"

nig.15.t:0 "The Native and The Colonist"
nig.15.d:0 "For years, there has been a sharp divide between the rights of the natives and the rights of European settlers in our colony. The time has come to address this divide. There are several plans that are under consideration, none of them new. The Twining Plan calls for greater rights for natives while stopping short of full equality, a solution that would likely please all sides but push the issue aside for a later date. The Azikiwe Plan instead calls for full equality. Such an act would have mixed results; it would allow us to begin to develop as a colony in our right, in a more equal way, but it would also anger settlers and perhaps cause them to leave Nigeria or otherwise cause havoc. Finally, the Collaborationists have advocated for keeping the status quo; they see no real reason to change what they consider to be an efficient system for Nigeria. Regardless of each plan's name, there are many divisions within each party over which approach to take, and it is apparent that anything could happen. What should we do?"
nig.15.a:0 "Better treatment for the natives."
nig.15.b:0 "Full equality."
nig.15.c:0 "Maintain the status-quo."

nig.16.t:0 "An Ally in Afrika"
nig.16.d.brits:0 "The old British and French colonies in West Africa and Kenya are natural allies for us; they have similar histories under European control and they chafe under German rule just as we do. We should reach out to these nations in the hopes of establishing even closer relationships and perhaps one day, we will return to the British crown."
nig.16.d.native:0 "Ethiopia is a nation that has admirably resisted colonial rule; we should reach out to them and foster closer relations if we hope to be independent ourselves one day. They have a proud history, perhaps even more so than ours, but they understand the cost of freedom, and we should study them to see what their secrets are!"
nig.16.d.germs:0 "We must aim for closer relations with Mittelafrika if we are to survive these difficult times. Their government sees us as an unwieldy state, and it is true. However, if we are to reassure them of our loyalty, we can begin to cooperate more closely than ever before and hence create new stability in the country."
nig.16.a:0 "Off to Kenya!"
nig.16.b:0 "To Addis Ababa!"
nig.16.c:0 "On to Dar-es-Salaam!"

nig.17.t:0 "The Winds of Change"
nig.17.d.brits:0 "Our overlords in Mittelafrika have collapsed, and now is the time to break free of their control once and for all. However, our new freedom has come at the price of our security, and now we must find ways to secure our new borders from our neighbors as well as threats from across the ocean. We should also address the elephant in the room; the north has broken off from our main territory, and is now trying to act independently of us! One way to deal with all these new challenges would be to align ourselves with the Entente, and help them in their fight to liberate Europe from the syndicalist menace. We should do everything we can, both on the continent and elsewhere, to fight for the king. One day soon we will return to our place in the empire!"

nig.17.d.germs:0 "Our overlords in Mittelafrika have collapsed, and our actions in the coming months will be of utmost importance.

We should also address the elephant in the room; the north has broken off from our main territory, and is now trying to act independently of us! One way to deal with all these new challenges would be to stay loyal to Germany, and help them in their fight to rid Europe of the syndicalist menace. We should do everything we can, both on the continent and elsewhere, to fight for the Kaiser. One day soon we will return to our place in the empire, perhaps this time at the head of a new Westafrika..."`
nig.17.a:0 "A New Day!"

nig.18.t:0 "Considering Our Loyalties"
nig.18.d:0 "Now that German rule has essentially collapsed in Afrika, we should decide our loyalties once and for all. Already we have made some attempts at finding allies, but we will need more than diplomatic overtures if we want to protect our national security interests. Most of our advisors are pressuring us to sign a military alliance of sorts. The Unionists wish to see us align with the Entente, and perhaps eventually even rejoin the British Empire. Meanwhile, the Collaborationists want us to remain loyal to Germany, even if Mittelafrika and the other German colonies have collapsed. The Nationalists have scoffed at both suggestions, arguing instead for internal -and external- unity to fend off any threats. It seems that this external unity involves Nigeria's neighbors, and some Nationalists hope to bring them under our control in one way or another. Regardless, we must decide what our next course of action should be."
nig.18.a:0 "Nigeria will join her king once more!"
nig.18.b:0 "We have no need for these alliances!"
nig.18.c:0 "The Kaiser needs us!" 

nig.19.t:0 "Fighting Northern Dissidents"
nig.19.d:0 "The populations in the north of Nigeria, largely Muslim and belonging to the Hausa ethnic group, have agitated for what they call 'better treatment' for years now. In reality, it seems that it would be more accurate to describe their goals as having everyone in the government collectively close their eyes and let them break away unnoticed. This will obviously not do, so we have put a few different plans together for how to deal with these northern rebels, should they ever truly break away. Our spies report that prominent rebel groups in the region are biding their time, waiting for the right opportunity to break away. They argue that the northerners would not dare break away unless Nigeria was in some sort of crisis. Regardless of how well we plan for this event, we should also do everything we can to prevent a rebellion before it ever happens. The first step in our response will be to send in elite German and Nigerian troops to eliminate the worst of the rebels, and hopefully defang the movement as a whole. However, this will only be the beginning, even if it does succeed, and we should plan for prolonged counter-insurgency tactics in the north."
nig.19.a:0 "Target the Muslim Brotherhood!"

nig.200.t:0 "Bornu's Fate"
nig.200.d:0 "The future of the breakaway state of Borno is a question on the minds of all Nigerian statesmen, and it has been since the collapse of the nation. Though they have their own identity, in some ways, allowing them to leave would harm our regime and perhaps fracture the country into even smaller polities. We cannot afford to let them break away completely. There are a few options available to us, however. We could offer a trade deal that would essentially see Bornu become a subservient economy, or we could give them an ultimatum to rejoin our nation or face war. Regardless of what we decide, we must decide soon, lest they find allies and slip out of our hands forever."
nig.200.a:0 "Sign a trade deal!"
nig.200.b:0 "Make the demand!"

nig.20.t:0 "Nigeria Demands We Return!"
nig.20.d:0 "It was only months ago that we broke away from Nigeria and founded our own state. However, our former allies have not been idle since that time; they have been looking for any excuse to force us back into the nation as a whole. Despite our best wishes, they have now given us an ultimatum: we can either rejoin Nigeria or face an invasion. We cannot hope to fend off an invasion on our own, but perhaps we could hold them off long enough for them to lose interest. Or, we could accede to their demands and rejoin the nation. What should we do?"
nig.20.a:0 "Very well, we will rejoin..."
nig.20.b:0 "Never!"

nig.21.t:0 "Bornu Chooses War!"
nig.21.d:0 "Bornu has responded to our request for annexation with a scathing rebuke, noting that they would rather die as a free nation than rejoin a country that oppresses Muslims. That is their choice..."
nig.21.a:0 "Crush them!"
nig.21.b:0 "Bide our time..."

nig.22.t:0 "Bornu Accepts!"
nig.22.d:0 "Hurrah! Bornu has given into our pressure and accepted our ultimatum-they will rejoin our nation. Now we can move forward as a new united Nigeria, and we are one step closer to ensuring our independence in the long run."
nig.22.a:0 "Wonderful!"

nig.23.t:0 "Clifford's True Legacy"
nig.23.d:0 "Though all agree that Hugh Clifford left an enduring legacy on the nation, there is much disagreement on how we should continue his work. There are various aspects of life in Nigeria that Clifford improved: the administrative efficiency of the government, the military's discipline and size, and even the ability of the colony to trade with Germany and its neighbors. Our advisors note that we could go in any one of these directions, but not two or even all three of them, as this would be far less efficient and cost money we do not have. So, which of these 'legacies' should we pursue?"
nig.23.a:0 "The Administrative Legacy."
nig.23.b:0 "The Military Legacy."
nig.23.c:0 "The Diplomatic Legacy."

nig.24.t:0 "Prepare for War?"
nig.24.d:0 "One of the largest disputes among Nigerians is faith. Christianity and Islam are confined to different spheres of the country, but this only makes unity more difficult. Tensions have risen in recent years, with the influx of German administrators upsetting the old balance and forcing us to craft some sort of response. Unfortunately, some of our advisors insist that a response should be both militaristic and religious in nature, targeting the Muslim populations in the north. This is unlikely to yield any real results, but we can use the concept of a spiritual war as propaganda while the government attempts to craft real solutions behind the scenes."
nig.24.a:0 "To war, sort of!"

nig.25.t:0 "Let Hausaland Go?"
nig.25.d:0 "Our oldest citizens can remember a time when Nigeria was divided into many states, a time when ethnic groups enjoyed either self-rule or a great deal more autonomy than they do now. Now that German rule has collapsed, it is time to reconsider this arrangement. To make things more pressing, the Northern People's Congress, a party founded to represent northern Nigerian interests, has led Hausaland to declare independence from the South. There are many in Lagos and elsewhere who have been recently energized by Nigerian or Pan-African nationalism, chiefly the National Youth Movement, and call for the north to be brought back into the fold. Hausaland has refused to negotiate and insists that we respect their separation, an arrangement that existed as late as 1914. Should we declare war or allow them their independence?"
nig.25.a:0 "Bring them back!"
nig.25.b:0 "Let them go."

nig.26.t:0 "The Future of Nigeria"
nig.26.d.brits:0 "Despite our best attempts to unify the country under our rule, it seems that it will take time and careful governance to create a sense of national identity; we cannot force it. Edward Twining's policy of giving more representation to natives has soothed tensions somewhat, but we will need to further orient our policy towards the natives with regards to their diverse nature. More than any group, the Yoruba ethnic group in the Southwest of the colony has been given power, but if we extend this to the Hausa in the north, we may just bring some stability back to Nigeria. When the King controlled our colony, it was split into two regions, and though this is not desirable, we should understand their desire for some power within our government. A stable Nigeria would be more likely to be granted dominion status, should we choose to rejoin the British Empire. On the other hand, we could do the unthinkable and allow them to break away. The north is underdeveloped and has only caused trouble for our government in the south, and we would be even more stable as a unified south than as a unified nation. What should we do?"
nig.26.d.native:0 "Though we call ourselves the Nationalists, our various factions mainly hold power in the south. Herbert Macauley's newspaper, which has been so important for our movement, is quite literally called the "Lagos Daily News". Nnamdi Azikiwe, meanwhile, has some roots in the north, but he is more acquainted with Lagos, Ghana, and even America. We cannot be nationalists if we do not also include the northern Hausa in our government. After all, both the Yoruba and Igbo groups have representation in our government, despite their rivalry. At the same time, we could allow the Hausa-dominated region to break away, and make do with the south. The National Youth Movement has protested this, but pragmatism may take precedence over idealism. What should we do?"
nig.26.d.germs:0 "The Kaiser's rule is strong in Nigeria thanks to our help, but we will have to come to a more permanent arrangement with the north if we are to keep the colony together. Their desire for representation is no different from the calls for representation in the south, and we would be wise to grant them some sort of power. However, such power would likely mostly be on paper, and we would ensure we kept control over the primary administrative, military, and financial matters of the colony. On the other hand, we might be more useful to the German Empire as a purely southern colony; the region is more developed, and we could focus our resources on the motherland, not fighting Muslims in the north. We must make a decision."
nig.26.a:0 "Give them their representation..."
nig.26.b:0 "Let them go!"

nig.27.t:0 "Asking for Help"
nig.27.d:0 "It is clear to all involved that we need outside assistance if we hope to crush the stubborn northern resistance. There are several options we could pursue in the hopes of remedying this crisis. We could appeal to Westafrika, Kenya, and other colonies who have similar problems and could potentially send men or money to get the job done. There is also the local mercenary market. These mercenaries would obviously be more expensive than our own forces, but we may need the boost they could provide, given that they are much better trained and equipped than our own national forces. Perhaps Mittelafrika would also be willing to assist us, especially given the fact that any conflicts in our region could spill into their directly-owned territories. These options all have their pros and cons, but we must do something before it is too late. What will we decide?"
nig.27.a:0 "Talk to Westafrika and Kenya."
nig.27.b:0 "Hire some of these mercenaries."
nig.27.c:0 "Appeal to Mittelafrika for help."

nig.28.t:0 "Addressing Yoruba and Igbo Tensions"
nig.28.d:0 "There is much attention on the current north-south divide in Nigeria, but colonial administrators forget that the south of the country is quite diverse as well. The Yoruba ethnic group is primarily located in the southwest of Nigeria, and they have more power than perhaps any other ethnic group in Nigeria, thanks to their location. However, the Igbo ethnic group has contested this power as tenaciously as the Hausa, though with more success. From this rivalry came the first moves towards a federal system in our colony, and further implementing such a system would certainly be possible, given our high degree of autonomy within the German Empire. The only downside for us may be that the Hausa will ask for representation as well, so that by solving one conflict we will exasperate another. Regardless, if the Hausa ever do become a threat, we will need a unified south to stand a chance against them, and so we must move forward with federalism!"
nig.28.a:0 "One step closer to unity!"

nig.29.t:0 "Status of Religion"
nig.29.d:0 "An issue that has plagued us for decades is the status of religion in the nation. In the pre-colonial days, Islam and traditional religions were dominant in Nigeria, but with the introduction of colonial rule and Christianity, the situation has only become more complex. The British and Germans after them understood that they had to protect the Muslims in the north and the Christians in the south if they were to rule with any effectiveness, though for all the efforts of the Germans, tensions have risen in recent years. Part of this tension stems from power; the southern ethnic groups have far more power than the northern ones, and the Muslim Fulani and Hausa groups have accused the government of bias towards Christian Nigerians. In addition, there is significant tension caused by the northern desire to impose Sharia law on the entirety of the region. It would be unthinkable for us to grant such a demand, but perhaps a system in which native leadership alternates between Muslims and Christians would suffice in giving the Muslims the power they desire. This would be a painful deal, but one that may need to be made to ensure Nigeria's continued unity. What should we do?"
nig.29.a:0 "Offer power tradeoffs on religious grounds."
nig.29.b:0 "Pressure them to give up Sharia law."

nig.30.t:0 "Improving the Government System"
nig.30.d.colonial:0 "The question of how to govern Nigeria has troubled colonial administrators since the inception of the colony itself. At first, the British opted to grant local rulers some authority in a "Nigerian Council", but eventually the administration evolved into three distinct regional systems: north, southwest, and southeast. In the north, the British took care to respect the Muslim faith, and in the south, British rule was assured by the Legislative Council. This system was effective because the British employed indirect rule and had the approval of local rulers, and it is a system that the Germans have done their best to emulate. Outside observers see a Nigerian colony, but anyone familiar with the region knows that the north, southwest, and southeast are all fiercely independent and have significant differences. Though we have been granted more autonomy as of late, this state of affairs also comes with a downside: we don't have the power or resources we once did. As such, we must come to an arrangement that will satisy all populations in question, and the best proposal to do this is through a federal system. We have taken steps to move closer to a federal system in the past, but if we were to solidify it now, we would codify the already-existing regional arrangements while also working to unify the nation. It is an efficient solution, but some colonials complain that it will reduce their influence in their respective regions, and leave them without enough power to respond to crises. It seems that implementing an official federal system will be a...leap of faith, but perhaps a necessary one if we want to maintain control over the north. What should we do?"
nig.30.d.native:0 "The issue of federalism in Nigeria is one that the northern Hausa have pushed relentlessly; turning the region into a federal state would guarantee the autonomy they have traditionally held. Certainly, granting such a system using the old British colonial borders would give the north more than half the population and enough power to dominate the south. This is a fact that both sides are aware of. On the other hand, if we can modify the borders somewhat, the power imbalance will be much less significant. The Hausa would obviously protest such a demand, but if they had to choose between a modified federal system and no federal system at all, they might reconsider. It is a risky maneuver nonetheless, but one we will likely have to accept if we want to keep Nigeria united. What should we do?"
nig.30.a:0 "Federalism with the old British borders."
nig.30.b:0 "Federalism with modified states."

nig.31.t:0 "End of Negotiations"
nig.31.d:0 "For better or worse, today is the day that we decide the future of Nigeria. After complex negotiations between the north and south, the question of whether Nigeria will remain united is the prime issue on everyone's minds. The delegates announce that the outcome is..."
nig.31.a:0 "A One State Solution!"
nig.31.b:0 "A Two State Solution!"

nig.32.t:0 "Macauley and Azikiwe"
nig.32.d:0 "The story of the birth of a unified Nigeria identity is a fiery one. Throughout its long history, the region now known as the Nigerian Free State has been marred with ethnic clashes and division. From the Benin and Hausa kingdoms of old to the Kanim Borno and Edo Benin states that fell with the rise of the British Empire, many have tried to unify these lands, but all have failed. That was until the Europeans played their final hand in their imperialist crusades and carved up our continent without remorse or thought to who resided here. Even the greatest of empires must fall, and as the Lion once roared over our lands, now screeches the Imperial Eagle of the Huns. Their arrival and brutality, however, has proved to be their undoing as the fires of their colonial ambition has also given spark to the Nigerian people as well. Long divided over religion, language, and regional or cultural identities, many began to use the Nigerian people’s new common enemy to foster a kinship that would never falter. No more important to this forging of a unified spirit was none other than Olayinka Heelas Badmus Macaulay, or as he is more commonly known, Herbert Macaulay. None in our lands can deny that he is the main architect, the father of Nigerian nationalism. His work over his long life has been to the betterment of his fellow Nigerian, holding many disciplines over his career in analytics, surveying, musical composition, author, and statesmen to name a few.\n\n In his old age, being born in 1864, Macaulay has taken a particular liking to a certain Nnamdi Azikiwe, current party leader of the Nigerian Front Party, a party they co-founded together in the wake of the German occupation after their victory in the Weltkrieg. Macaulay has served as a mentor to the young politician, bonding over their national views, Pan-African leanings, and a shared dream of a free Nigeria. With ‘Zik’ now party head, Macaulay has taken a back seat to politics in the colony, allowing Azikiwe to propel to the national forefront, and becoming one of the major candidates in the upcoming 3rd Nigerian Parliament elections. Macaulay had officially endorsed Azikiwe in the recent elections, and with Azikiwe’s recent win that shocked the nation, Macaulay can relax in his semi-retirement, knowing the future of the Nigerian people is secure."

nig.33.d:0 "It has come to our administration’s attention that our colonial brothers in Kenya have been besieged and defiled by vile Marxist rebels known as the Mau-Mau. Little more than armed rabble, mainly made up of disgruntled farmers and labourers, their persistence has proven to be quite a thorn in the local administration's side. Many in our parliament clamour that we must send aid, while our more Hawkish MP’s want to directly intervene and help the Kenyan Frontier Force dismantle and eradicate the Mau-Mau completely. Interestingly, this has been one of the few resolutions in recent memory that has been widely agreed on by both the Anglos, who seek to help their brethren in Kenya, and the Germans, who seek to preserve Mittelafrika’s integrity and prestige. The only main opposition are certain members of Nmamdi Azikiwe’s Nigerian Front Party, whose Pan-Afrikan ideals impassioned them to the Mau-Mau. Despite this small camp, ‘Zik’ himself and the rest of the hardliners strongly agree with intervention or aid, as they are none too fond of Marxism’s taint and its potential to infect our pristine continent."

nig.34.d:0 "Nnamdi Azikiwe has had many mentors, teachers, and muses in his career on his path to form his unique blend of Pan-African thought. Though Henry Macaulay was his greatest teacher, Marcus Garvey has proven to be his greatest compatriot. Separated by the hundreds of miles between Benin and Monrovia, the two constantly send correspondence and host each other at various events and visits; the topic of discussion almost always revolves around Pan-African ideals. African art, music, culture, religion, history, politics, the list goes on and on. Though Garvey is admittedly the far more radical of the two, their differences in small details on the Black struggle is far overshadowed by their similarities and deep friendship. These two titans of the movement both hold high aspirations for themselves and their peoples, and with their cooperation, the Black Man may finally earn their long-held dreams of freedom."

nig.36.t:0 "The Smallest of Cracks"
nig.36.d:0 "The Nigerian National Party has come a long way since its founding, and now with party head Nmamdi Azizkwe at the helm of the nation, Azizkwe can realize his dream of an independent Nigeria. Though true, total independence would be years, if not decades, off into the future, but by instituting economic and political reforms to strengthen and secure our economy while empowering the Nigerian people, ‘Zik’ could guide the nation towards an independent future. With authoritarianism and autarky, Azizikwe plans to carry Nigeria towards its rightful destiny. These measures have begun to make many in the party nervous, and debates in party meetings have grown more turbid and venomous. Chief among these critics of ‘Zik’ has been Obafemi Awolowo, Pan-African firebrand and loud-piece for the more disenfranchised and downtrodden of Nigeria. Though not openly a leftist by any means, Awolowo holds *questionable* views on certain issues regarding leftists, such as his open stance of solidarity with the Mau-Mau, not as a fellow Marxist but as a fellow African. In parliament, the Nigerian National Party maintains its facade of complete and unwavering unity, but on the inside, the smallest of cracks are beginning to show."

nig.37.t:0 "The Nigerian National Father Makes a Choice"
nig.37.d:0 "Shocking the nation, Nnamdi Azikiwe, or as he is more commonly referred to by the people as Zik, has risen to become the face of the Nigerian Free State and its head of state. Now, with the reins of power in his hands, and with the entire colony now at his command given his democratically-secured mandate, Zik must make a decision on how to go forth and lead, or rule, his people.\n\nLong despising separatists, regionalists, and monarchists, Azikiwe instead has always advocated for cooperation between the democratic and nationalist forces of Nigeria, even working with socialists such as his friend, and oftentimes rival, Obafemi Awolowo to achieve his dream of a free and sovereign Nigerian nation. Now with the power to dictate the future of his people and his nation, he is left with a choice. Zik could stay true to his democratic principles and push for the fair Nigerian republic he has always dreamed of, but the circling wolves of former colonials and opportunistic foes have given the honored statesman a reason to reconsider his positions.\n\nIf he were to abandon his democratic principles, even if only temporarily, it would be to steel the Nigerian people into a single and unified force ready to defend their culture and their borders at any cost - a noble cause but not one that necessarily requires him to resort to authoritarianism - the very habits he and his people have languished under for decades. Whatever his choice may be, one thing is for certain: Nigeria is no longer for the colonials, for Nigeria is now for Nigerians!"
nig.37.a:0 "Zik doubles-down on his pursuit of a united Nigerian national identity at any cost."
nig.37.b:0 "Zik chooses to remain as the paternalistic national father of Nigeria, shirking democratic promises."
nig.37.c:0 "Zik shall embrace his democratic ideals and push for a big tent movement with a nationalist lean."
nig.37.e:0 "Zik, along with the National Council of Nigeria, shall bring true, equitable democracy to Nigeria."

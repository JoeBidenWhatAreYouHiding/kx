### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SAID_TAIMUR_DESC: "The Al Said dynasty, which had reaped the benefits of British support in the 19th century, still lives. Following the Peace with Honor in 1921, the young Said bin Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur bin Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said bin Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Trucial coast and the Ibadi tribesman in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said bin Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that opresses Dhofar."

### Decisions ###
OMA_Saudi_Invasion: "War in the Desert"
OMA_Saudi_Invasion_desc: "The stubborn refusal of the Imam to cooperate with Muscat and the lack of cohesive leadership on both sides of our nation has left us open to attack by the Ikhwan. With many following the incredible rise in power of the Saudi dynasty, some of the tribes even within our lands are starting to doubt whether Ibn Saud isn't truly sent by Allah to reunite the Arab people..."

OMA_omani_trade_fleet_desc: "Our trade vessels are full of holes and can't hold nearly the cargo our burgeoning society needs to import. Let's commission a fleet of 20 new ships that can ply the world's waters to build up Oman!"
OMA_foreign_naval_officers: "Foreign Naval Officers"
OMA_foreign_naval_officers_desc: "Just because we have the ships doesn't mean we know how to use them. Let's offer a high salary to a few foreign officers who can teach our sailors how to make the best use of our new navy!"
OMA_royal_army_reform: "Royal Army Reform"
OMA_royal_army_reform_desc: "What remains of our army was designed to deal with tribal uprisings, not the larger scale warfare we seem to be moving to. We need to reform our units to deal with large-scale engagements."
OMA_the_saudi_threat: "The Northern Threat"
OMA_the_saudi_threat_desc: "Be it Saudi's or others, those to the North have always had designs on the entire Arabian Peninsula. Let's fortify the obvious areas of attack to deter potential aggression."
OMA_muscat_armament_plan: "Muscat Armament Plan"
OMA_muscat_armament_plan_desc: "We have a plan for how our ground forces will engage the enemy, but they will need arms to do so. We need a new factory dedicated to producing military hardware for our divisions."

OMA_hierarchy_reorganization: "Military Hierarchy Reorganisation"

OMA_royal_airforce: "Omani Royal Air Force"
OMA_royal_airforce_desc: "We have heard tale of how planes changed the face of the Weltkrieg, and seen German planes buzzing through the desert sun. Maybe it's time we invest into an air force of our own."
OMA_anti_aircraft_defenses: "Urban AA Defences"
OMA_anti_aircraft_defenses_desc: "With few places of high population concentration in our country, a concentrated air assault on our urban areas could be devastating. We need to find way to protect ourselves from such an onslaught."

OMA_economical_reform_planning: "Commence Economic Reorganisation"

OMA_muscat_airport_desc: "To improve transportation for our increasingly modern government, and facilitate an expansion of our military air force, let's build a new air strip outside the capital of Muscat."

OMA_taxate_the_hinterlands_desc: "Now that we have a standardised tax system, we need to get our collectors out from the urban areas, into outlying villages and tribal areas in the desert. Incorporating the outlying areas wasn't cheap, and they have to bear so me of the burden."

OMA_dhofar_railway: "Dhofar Railway"
OMA_dhofar_railway_desc: "Now that we have at least one major rail line though Muscat itself, we need to integrate the rest of Oman with this rail line. Goods and citizens from as far away as Dohfar will be able to get across the entire country in less than a day's travel. Of course this stands to benefit our military as well, as faster transportation means faster troops!"
OMA_port_of_muscat: "Port of Muscat"
OMA_port_of_muscat_desc: "We have always been a sea trading society, and while our rail makes moving products easier in country, the real profit comes from when we export goods by sea.

OMA_local_manufactury_incentives_desc: "We need to provide local incentives in Oman to utilise all the spare labor the state cannot effectively utilise.

OMA_commerce_industrialization_plan: "Commercial Industries Plan"
OMA_commerce_industrialization_plan_desc: "Providing incentives to small military manufacturing companies will allow them to expand their production base, speeding up the process of industrialising the process of manufacturing military vehicles and small arms. We need more military factories if we are to keep up with out increasingly aggressive neighbours!"
OMA_intensify_administration_plan: "Intensify Industrial Initiatives"
OMA_intensify_administration_plan_desc: "We are confident that with our current industrial plan we will be able to expand our military capacity in an adequate fashion. It still remains to be seen if we can keep up with an increasing middle class and their ever larger demand for commercial goods.

OMA_persian_protection: "Persian Protection"

OMA_equipment_efforts: "Equipment Efforts"
OMA_equipment_efforts_desc: "A relationship with a major regional power has the benefit of military training exercises, and even better observation of their military hardware. Let's take these experiences back to our R&D team and improve the working designs of our military vehicles."

OMA_royal_navy_cooperation: "Royal Navy Cooperation"
OMA_royal_navy_cooperation_desc: "Canada is now leading the Entente, and focusing on building larger ships of the line.

OMA_a_special_relationship: "A Special Relationship"
OMA_a_special_relationship_desc: "India has offered to help us run our government in a way that will benefit the Entente.

OMA_egyptian_mediation: "Egyptian Mediation"
OMA_egyptian_mediation_desc: "Let us petition some of our Arab friends to help us mediate the disputes we have with the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Certainly, this will keep the people calm, and not concerned about the effect going to more outside infidel help would have on our country."
OMA_solve_issues_with_yemen: "Solve Issues with Yemen"
OMA_solve_issues_with_yemen_desc: "Yemen has long had claims on the Dohfar region. We need to negotiate and solve these issues with Yemen, and Egypt will be a fair mediator in this issue. While we will have to make some small concessions people on the border won't be happy with, it will keep our territorial integrity."
OMA_solve_arabian_issues: "Solve Arabian Border Disputes"
OMA_solve_arabian_issues_desc: "The Arabs of the central Peninsula have long had designs on our ports and tradeways. Egypt has offered to broke a settlement of sorts that keeps our territorial integrity, in exchange for some small concessions. While we don't like it, we have little choice if we want Egypt's support."
OMA_cairo_pact_arms_deal: "Cairo Arms Deal"
OMA_cairo_pact_arms_deal_desc: "Our reliance on, and support of Egypt has paid massive dividends.

A huge bounty for our military, and one that should guarantee our freedom for years to come."
OMA_porte_assistance: "The Rauf Pasha Mission"
OMA_porte_assistance_desc: "It is a harsh truth that we cannot face the strength of the Saudis by ourselves. If we don't want Muscat to fall to the invaders, we must accept the military expedition the Sublime Porte has offered us, as difficult as it might be to convince ourselves of the good intentions of the Ottomans."
OMA_military_reform: "Implement Ottoman Military Reforms"
OMA_military_reform_desc: "The mission led by admiral Rauf Pasha has shown us the inadequate state of our military, both in organisation and tactics. With the assistance of the Ottomans, we can kickstart a modernisation of our army."

OMA_freedom_once_more_desc: "With the Saudi threat gone, we don't need the protection of the Ottomans anymore. It's time for Rauf Pasha to return to Basra, and for us to recover our precious independence."

### Events ###
oma.1.t: "Introduction to Oman"
oma.1.d: "Oman's splendid isolation did not end with the Weltkrieg and the Sultan hoped it wouldn't end any time soon. However, the wheel of fate stops for no one, and their protectors in Britain and India fell into utter and complete disarray. With Ottoman forces moving into the Trucial States, and an ever more aggressive Ibn Saud in Nejd, it seemed war was coming fast to Oman, and the tale of the Ibadi Sultanate was to finally end.\n\nHowever, the much feared war never came. The warriors mobilised by the state never saw battle against the Ikhwan and the Saudis... Perhaps Ibn Saud has other, more obscure plans in his mind? Regardless of reason, Oman stood alone, and has not received aid from British India in a decade. This may very well become an extremely worrisome state of affairs as instability rapidly spreads throughout the region.\n\nBut to properly fight external threats, internal ones must be properly dealt with. More specifically the Imamate of Oman, and the tribes that have their allegiance to the Hinterlands Imam higher than to Muscat; not to mention the degraded and archaic state of the Monarchy. But if these challenges can be overcome, Oman's tale is not to end so soon."
oma.1.a: "Very well."

oma.6.t: "Offer from Oman"
oma.6.d: "Afraid of the Arabian nations on their borders, Oman has requested protection from us once again. While the English revolution and subsequent fall of the Empire had seen them break off and attempt to sustain their neutrality, they have now realised that without our protection they are doomed to fall."
oma.6.a: "Offer them protection."
oma.6.b: "Refuse their request."

oma.7.t: "Offer from Oman"
oma.7.d: "Aware of our conflicts with the Arabians and they themselves involved in a struggle with their neighbours to the West and North, Oman has requested us to assist them in any future conflicts on the peninsula. While our protection should deter them from attacking Oman, we could get bogged down in an unwanted conflict with Egypt and its allies if we aren't careful."
oma.7.a: "Offer them protection."
oma.7.b: "Refuse their request."

oma.10.t: "Imam loyalists refuse to pay taxes"
oma.10.d: "The Imamate has long been exempting its loyalists from paying their taxes to our administers which has led to outcry from the citizens who do pay their share. Something will have to be done about this system if we want to ensure a stable system and reduce the power of Imamn and likewise factions."
oma.10.a: "Loyalty should be rewarded!"

oma.11.t: "Tribal raids"
oma.11.d: "Raids from hostile tribes have long plagued the hinterlands of Oman and with Saudi power increasing in the region and ours wavering, they only seem to become even fiercer than before. Our army is doing everything it can to crack down on these bandits but they keep escaping our hold."
oma.11.a: "Catch these bandits!"

oma.12.t: "Black Monday strikes Oman"
oma.12.d: "Disaster! The Berlin stock exchange has completely collapsed and sent ripples throughout the world, ruining economies and businesses around the globe. While our small agrarian nation has been mostly spared by the catastrophe, foreign investors and businesses are still suffering the consequences and dragging us down with them."
oma.12.a: "Let us pray for a quick resolution to this crisis."

oma.13.t: "Protecting Oman"
oma.13.d: "Building upon past agreements, the Omani regime has transfered responsibility for portions of its foreign relations and defence to our nation. We now exert substantial influence over the Sultanate."
oma.13.a: "Great!"

oma.14.t: "Ibn Saud marches on the al-Buraimi Oasis"
oma.14.d: "Placed on the border between Muscat and the former Trucial States, ownership over the Oasis has been a contested affair for many generations between the Sultans of Muscat and the Emirs further North. With the conquest of the latter by Ibn Saud, he has also taken over these old claims and is using them for his own machinations.\n\nIt is no secret however that Ibn Saud is not planning to stop his advance after taking the Oasis and by claiming that we were once part of the great Wahabbist state, he will surely not stop until the city of Muscat is ablaze and the vile Ikhwan has slaugthered all that oppose him.\n\nThe threat posed by Ibn Saud however has ensured better relations between the Imam and the Sultan as despite their differences, they both strongly adhere to Omani particularism and will stop at nothing to defend their homeland from the invaders."
oma.14.a: "Dark clouds are brewing over our small nation..."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SAID_TAIMUR_DESC:0 "The Al Said dynasty, which had reaped the benefits of British support in the 19th century, still lives. Following the Peace with Honor in 1921, the young Said bin Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur bin Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said bin Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Trucial coast and the Ibadi tribesmen in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said bin Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that oppresses Dhofar."

### Decisions ###
OMA_Saudi_Invasion:0 "War in the Desert"
OMA_Saudi_Invasion_desc:0 "The stubborn refusal of the Imam to cooperate with Muscat and the lack of cohesive leadership on both sides of our nation has left us open to attack by the Ikhwan. With many following the incredible rise in power of the Saudi dynasty, some of the tribes even within our lands are starting to doubt whether Ibn Saud isn't truly sent by Allah to reunite the Arab people..."

OMA_defense_of_the_realm_desc:0 "The Imam has demanded the utmost protection for our new realm. We need to get the right people into the right positions as a good start. All branches of the military including the army, the navy, and we need to develop an air force at some point."
OMA_royal_navy:0 "Rebuild the Omani Royal Navy"

OMA_muscat_royal_dockyard:0 "Muscat Dockyards"

OMA_omani_trade_fleet:0 "The New Merchant Fleet"
OMA_omani_trade_fleet_desc:0 "Our trade vessels are full of holes and can't hold nearly the cargo our burgeoning society needs to import. Let's commission a fleet of 20 new ships that can ply the world's waters to build up Oman!"
OMA_foreign_naval_officers:0 "Foreign Naval Officers"
OMA_foreign_naval_officers_desc:0 "Just because we have the ships doesn't mean we know how to use them. Let's offer a high salary to a few foreign officers who can teach our sailors how to make the best use of our new navy!"
OMA_royal_army_reform:0 "Royal Army Reform"
OMA_royal_army_reform_desc:0 "What remains of our army was designed to deal with tribal uprisings, not the larger scale warfare we seem to be moving to. We need to reform our units to deal with large-scale engagements."
OMA_the_saudi_threat:0 "The Northern Threat"
OMA_the_saudi_threat_desc:0 "Be it Saudis or others, those to the North have always had designs on the entire Arabian Peninsula. Let's fortify the obvious areas of attack to deter potential aggression."
OMA_muscat_armament_plan:0 "Muscat Armament Plan"
OMA_muscat_armament_plan_desc:0 "We have a plan for how our ground forces will engage the enemy, but they will need arms to do so. We need a new factory dedicated to producing military hardware for our divisions."
OMA_artillery_purchases:0 "Artillery Purchases"
OMA_artillery_purchases_desc:0 "Guns only shoot so far. Fighting on the open ground of the desert we need long range artillery to destroy enemy forces before they engage ours. The best way to acquire this is to petition a foreign government for prototypes."

OMA_infantry_equipment_reorganization_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg rifles our units are currently using are breaking down in the field, and our diplomats have come back with far more advanced weapons from other countries. It's time to update our equipment from at least this decade."

OMA_dealing_with_tribal_militias_desc:0 "The tribes in the outlying desert areas have been sapping our manpower and state support for too long. They need to be dealt with, and swiftly, if we are to get our armed forces into fighting shape."
OMA_regular_regiments:0 "Regular Regiments"
OMA_regular_regiments_desc:0 "Our former tribal units are equipped with a wide variety of arms and sundries. This has made it expensive to re-equip regiments in the field, as we don't always know what they need. Standardising a field kit will increase the effectiveness of our units and reduce attrition, since we can pick and choose the best for our men."
OMA_hierarchy_reorganization:0 "Military Hierarchy Reorganisation"

OMA_royal_airforce_desc:0 "We have heard tales of how planes changed the face of the Weltkrieg, and seen German planes buzzing through the desert sun. Maybe it's time we invest into an air force of our own."
OMA_anti_aircraft_defenses:0 "Urban AA Defences"
OMA_anti_aircraft_defenses_desc:0 "With few places of high population concentration in our country, a concentrated air assault on our urban areas could be devastating. We need to find ways to protect ourselves from such an onslaught."
OMA_aerial_training:0 "Aerial Training"
OMA_aerial_training_desc:0 "The few planes we do have don't know how to work together toward a common objective. We have to train our pilots using common techniques, and standardise our flying formations."

OMA_tax_reform_desc:0 "We need to standardise the way we collect taxes from the populace, and potentially separate it from the tithe's the Imam collects.

OMA_economical_reform_planning:0 "Commence Economic Reorganisation"
OMA_economical_reform_planning_desc:0 "Vast tracts of land are under the protection of the Imam and other members of our oligarchy. If we open this land up for business development, our best entrepreneurial minds will find the best use."

OMA_muscat_airport:0 "Muscat Airstrip"
OMA_muscat_airport_desc:0 "To improve transportation for our increasingly modern government, and facilitate an expansion of our military air force, let's build a new air strip outside the capital of Muscat."

OMA_taxate_the_hinterlands_desc:0 "Now that we have a standardised tax system, we need to get our collectors out from the urban areas, into outlying villages and tribal areas in the desert. Incorporating the outlying areas wasn't cheap, and they have to bear some of the burden."

OMA_call_banners_from_the_hinterlands_desc:0 "If we only recruit our armies from the coastal regions of our country, we are missing out on a huge proportion of manpower. We should call in the banners of the largest tribal warlords to augment our armed forces."

OMA_loyalty_to_the_imam_desc:0 "We have tribal warlords, rich business leaders, and powerful religious figures all doing what they want, destabilising our great nation.

OMA_budget_recovery:0 "Budget Recovery"
OMA_budget_recovery_desc:0 "Our budget has been decimated by the aftereffects of Black Monday.

We will have to re-balance this in the future, but we need to get things working now."
OMA_budget_rebalancing:0 "Budget Re-balancing"
OMA_budget_rebalancing_desc:0 "Now that our budget is at least sort of recovered, we need to re-balance how our money is spent between military pursuits, and nation building. We need to set our priorities and fund those first, and worry about extraneous budget items later."

OMA_muscat_railway_company_desc:0 "The industrial revolution largely passed Oman by in the 19th century, and we are determined to catch it ourselves in the 20th. Let's found a solid state company for managing rail networks, and lay the ties for the first line through the capital to some outlying areas immediately."
OMA_dhofar_railway:0 "Dhofar Railway"
OMA_dhofar_railway_desc:0 "Now that we have at least one major rail line though Muscat itself, we need to integrate the rest of Oman with this rail line. Goods and citizens from as far away as Dohfar will be able to get across the entire country in less than a day's travel. Of course this stands to benefit our military as well, as faster transportation means faster troops!"
OMA_port_of_muscat:0 "Port of Muscat"
OMA_port_of_muscat_desc:0 "We have always been a sea trading society, and while our rails make moving products easier in the country, the real profit comes from when we export goods by sea. Connecting the rail lines to the seaways, and building infrastructure to facilitate transportation between them, will really get our economy flowing!"
OMA_local_manufactury_incentives:0 "Local Manufacturer Incentive"
OMA_local_manufactury_incentives_desc:0 "We need to provide local incentives in Oman to utilise all the spare labor the state cannot effectively utilise. Manufacturing all the small things citizens need, including appliances and tools, cheap clothing and the like, will reduce our imports and expand our trading opportunities with our trade partners."
OMA_commerce_industrialization_plan:0 "Commercial Industries Plan"
OMA_commerce_industrialization_plan_desc:0 "Providing incentives to small military manufacturing companies will allow them to expand their production base, speeding up the process of industrialising the process of manufacturing military vehicles and small arms. We need more military factories if we are to keep up with our increasingly aggressive neighbours!"
OMA_intensify_administration_plan:0 "Intensify Industrial Initiatives"
OMA_intensify_administration_plan_desc:0 "We are confident that with our current industrial plan we will be able to expand our military capacity in an adequate fashion. It still remains to be seen if we can keep up with an increasing middle class and their ever larger demand for commercial goods.

OMA_persian_protection:0 "Persian Protection"
OMA_persian_protection_desc:0 "Persia has a vested interest in an ally on the Arabian Peninsula, so will be a good candidate to ask for some protection against our enemies. Better a close ally than one far away like Egypt or India."
OMA_imperial_army_officers:0 "Imperial Army Officers"
OMA_imperial_army_officers_desc:0 "Persia has demanded that in return for our protection, they be able to embed a small number of their officers into all the units of our army. While this will give us much needed experience, the people won't like it that much. Still, sacrifices have to be made if we are to weather the coming storm."
OMA_equipment_efforts:0 "Equipment Efforts"
OMA_equipment_efforts_desc:0 "A relationship with a major regional power has the benefit of military training exercises, and even better observation of their military hardware. Let's take these experiences back to our R&D team and improve the working designs of our military vehicles."

OMA_prepare_for_resistance_desc:0 "We know they are coming, it's just a matter of when now. We need to prepare every man to defend the land we have worked so hard to improve and expand upon. FOR THE IMAM!"

OMA_join_the_isac:0 "Join the ISAC"
OMA_join_the_isac_desc:0 "Canada has offered us a place in the Imperial Scientific and Academic Council. It's a prestigious organisation, and our research and development team is salivating at the prospect of getting access to a global supply of new ideas and prototypes."
OMA_royal_navy_cooperation:0 "Royal Navy Cooperation"
OMA_royal_navy_cooperation_desc:0 "Canada is now leading the Entente, and focusing on building larger ships of the line. They have offered to help us with the technology of building destroyers cheaper, and more efficiently than we thought possible. We need to do our part to support the alliance that is keeping us from ultimate destruction."
OMA_a_special_relationship:0 "A Special Relationship"
OMA_a_special_relationship_desc:0 "India has offered to help us run our government in a way that will benefit the Entente. We hesitate at such a bargain in return for our freedom, but the alternative, total annihilation, is not a real option. Let us bend the knee to India in return for our freedom! Others will not be so kind, and they will let the Imam keep his place as the head of state."
OMA_egyptian_mediation:0 "Egyptian Mediation"
OMA_egyptian_mediation_desc:0 "Let us petition some of our Arab friends to help us mediate the disputes we have with the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Certainly, this will keep the people calm, and not concerned about the effect going to more outside infidel help would have on our country."
OMA_solve_issues_with_yemen:0 "Solve Issues with Yemen"
OMA_solve_issues_with_yemen_desc:0 "Yemen has long had claims on the Dohfar region. We need to negotiate and solve these issues with Yemen, and Egypt will be a fair mediator in this issue. While we will have to make some small concessions people on the border won't be happy with, it will keep our territorial integrity."
OMA_solve_arabian_issues:0 "Solve Arabian Border Disputes"
OMA_solve_arabian_issues_desc:0 "The Arabs of the central Peninsula have long had designs on our ports and tradeways. Egypt has offered to broker a settlement of sorts that keeps our territorial integrity, in exchange for some small concessions. While we don't like it, we have little choice if we want Egypt's support."
OMA_cairo_pact_arms_deal:0 "Cairo Arms Deal"
OMA_cairo_pact_arms_deal_desc:0 "Our reliance on, and support of Egypt has paid massive dividends. They are sending us massive supplies of military hardware, and the machine tools and building plans to produce more of them. A huge bounty for our military, and one that should guarantee our freedom for years to come."
OMA_porte_assistance:0 "The Rauf Pasha Mission"
OMA_porte_assistance_desc:0 "It is a harsh truth that we cannot face the strength of the Saudis by ourselves. If we don't want Muscat to fall to the invaders, we must accept the military expedition the Sublime Porte has offered us, as difficult as it might be to convince ourselves of the good intentions of the Ottomans."
OMA_military_reform:0 "Implement Ottoman Military Reforms"
OMA_military_reform_desc:0 "The mission led by admiral Rauf Pasha has shown us the inadequate state of our military, both in organisation and tactics. With the assistance of the Ottomans, we can kickstart a modernisation of our army."

### Events ###
oma.1.t:0 "Introduction to Oman"
oma.1.d:0 "Oman's splendid isolation did not end with the Weltkrieg and the Sultan hoped it wouldn't end any time soon. However, the wheel of fate stops for no one, and their protectors in Britain and India fell into utter and complete disarray. With Ottoman forces moving into the Trucial States, and an ever more aggressive Ibn Saud in Nejd, it seemed war was coming fast to Oman, and the tale of the Ibadi Sultanate was to finally end.\n\nHowever, the much feared war never came. The warriors mobilised by the state never saw battle against the Ikhwan and the Saudis... Perhaps Ibn Saud has other, more obscure plans in his mind? Regardless of reason, Oman stood alone, and has not received aid from British India in a decade. This may very well become an extremely worrisome state of affairs as instability rapidly spreads throughout the region.\n\nBut to properly fight external threats, internal ones must be properly dealt with. More specifically the Imamate of Oman, and the tribes that have their allegiance to the Hinterlands Imam higher than to Muscat; not to mention the degraded and archaic state of the Monarchy. But if these challenges can be overcome, Oman's tale is not to end so soon."
oma.1.a:0 "Very well."

oma.5.t:0 "Offer from Oman"
oma.5.d:0 "In awe of the growing power of our Axis, but also wary of neighboring Arab nations constituting the large part of the alliance, Oman has requested protection from us and help in settling the border disputes. While the English revolution and subsequent fall of the Empire had seen them break off and attempt to sustain their neutrality, they have now realised that without our protection they are doomed to fall."
oma.5.a:0 "Offer them protection."
oma.5.b:0 "Refuse their request."

oma.6.t:0 "Offer from Oman"
oma.6.d:0 "Afraid of the Arabian nations on their borders, Oman has requested protection from us once again. While the English revolution and subsequent fall of the Empire had seen them break off and attempt to sustain their neutrality, they have now realised that without our protection they are doomed to fall."
oma.6.a:0 "Offer them protection."
oma.6.b:0 "Refuse their request."

oma.7.t:0 "Offer from Oman"
oma.7.d:0 "Aware of our conflicts with the Arabians and themselves involved in a struggle with their neighbours to the West and North, Oman has requested us to assist them in any future conflicts on the peninsula. While our protection should deter them from attacking Oman, we could get bogged down in an unwanted conflict with Egypt and its allies if we aren't careful."
oma.7.a:0 "Offer them protection."
oma.7.b:0 "Refuse their request."

oma.8.t:0 "Omani Mediation - Dhofar"
oma.8.d:0 "With their new status as part of our grand Axis the Omani state sent an official delegation to Cairo, asking for our immediate mediation on the long-standing border issue between them and Yemen. With both nations having a stake in the desert region of Dhofar, resource barren yet important to Omani and Yemeni territorial integrity, the matter has to be determined once and for all if the alliance between our nations is to stand."
oma.8.a:0 "There shall be peace between Omanis and Yemenis"
oma.8.b:0 "It is not up to us to decide."

oma.9.t:0 "Omani Mediation - Khasab"
oma.9.d:0 "With their new status as part of our grand Axis the Omani state sent an official delegation to Cairo, asking for our immediate mediation on the long-standing border issue between them and Arabs. With both nations having a stake in the small port region of Khasab, important in the completion of the rich and mighty-in-trade Emirates area, the matter has to be determined once and for all if the alliance between our nations is to stand."
oma.9.a:0 "There shall be peace between Omanis and Arabs"
oma.9.b:0 "It is not up to us to decide."

oma.10.t:0 "Imam loyalists refuse to pay taxes"
oma.10.d:0 "The Imamate has long been exempting its loyalists from paying their taxes to our administrators which has led to outcry from the citizens who do pay their share. Something will have to be done about this system if we want to ensure a stable system and reduce the power of the Imam and likewise factions."
oma.10.a:0 "Loyalty should be rewarded!"

oma.11.t:0 "Tribal raids"
oma.11.d:0 "Raids from hostile tribes have long plagued the hinterlands of Oman and with Saudi power increasing in the region and ours wavering, they only seem to become even fiercer than before. Our army is doing everything it can to crack down on these bandits but they keep escaping our hold."
oma.11.a:0 "Catch these bandits!"

oma.12.t:0 "Black Monday strikes Oman"
oma.12.d:0 "Disaster! The Berlin stock exchange has completely collapsed and sent ripples throughout the world, ruining economies and businesses around the globe. While our small agrarian nation has been mostly spared by the catastrophe, foreign investors and businesses are still suffering the consequences and dragging us down with them."
oma.12.a:0 "Let us pray for a quick resolution to this crisis."

oma.13.t:0 "Protecting Oman"
oma.13.d:0 "Building upon past agreements, the Omani regime has transferred responsibility for portions of its foreign relations and defence to our nation. We now exert substantial influence over the Sultanate."
oma.13.a:0 "Great!"

oma.14.t:0 "Ibn Saud marches on the al-Buraimi Oasis"
oma.14.d:0 "Placed on the border between Muscat and the former Trucial States, ownership over the Oasis has been a contested affair for many generations between the Sultans of Muscat and the Emirs further North. With the conquest of the latter by Ibn Saud, he has also taken over these old claims and is using them for his own machinations.\n\nIt is no secret however that Ibn Saud is not planning to stop his advance after taking the Oasis and by claiming that we were once part of the great Wahhabist state, he will surely not stop until the city of Muscat is ablaze and the vile Ikhwan has slaughtered all that oppose him.\n\nThe threat posed by Ibn Saud however has ensured better relations between the Imam and the Sultan as despite their differences, they both strongly adhere to Omani particularism and will stop at nothing to defend their homeland from the invaders."
oma.14.a:0 "Dark clouds are brewing over our small nation..."

oma.15.t:0 "Legacy of the Ya’rubid and al-Busaidi Dynasties"
oma.15.d:0 "During the peak of the Ya’rubid and al-Busaidi dynasties, the Omani Empire stretched across the southern reaches of the Arab peninsula, down across eastern African from Zanzibar and coastal Kenya to the northern tip of Madagascar, with Omani influence even reaching into the heart of the Congo through a network of vassal states, trading partners, and wilayats. Though likely a fool's errand, many idealists, nationalists, extremist radicals, and dreamers look to this past legacy as an era of pride as Oman once again marches beneath the boot of foreign powers. Should we continue on and accept this new era of Omani oppression, or should we march South in order to reclaim this old legacy once and for all?"

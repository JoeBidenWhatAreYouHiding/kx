POR_totalist_party_long:0 "Partido Comunista Português (Rates)               §gFollowing his expulsion in 1926, following a refusal to collaborate with the Syndicalist-dominated CGT, former General Secretary José Carlos Rates has created his own splinter organisation still standing firm on an opposition of anarchist collaboration. Still holding influence over an older contingent of Communists, Rates has grown inspired by the revisionist, nationalistic Totalist school of thought during his time in France. If he were to take back control of the Party, Rates would likely take his revenge against the ascendant left-wing that ousted him and implement a technocratic, socialist system to safeguard the revolution from within and without.§!"

The General Confederation of Labour and the Portuguse Anarchist Federation are two interlinked factions, making up the Syndicalist bulwark of the United Front. The CGT is nominally led by founder Manuel Joaquim de Sousa from prison, who is represented by José da Silva Santos Arranha in Paris. The CGT is considered to be the most militant revolutionary group within Portugal, and has subsequently faced the most repression from Lisbon. The Portuguse Anarchist Federation is a wing of the Iberian Anarchist Federation, forming another political front for the CGT. Though de Sousa is a supporter of Pan-Iberian Unity, many within the CGT are at best sceptical, or at worst outwardly hostile to this position.§!"

The Portuguse Communist Party has struggled since the Restoration. Under the leadership of Bento António Gonçalves, they've operated on a policy of cooperation with the Anarchists and Syndicalists, a departure from the hostitly towards them under José Carlos Rates. By following a line of pragmatism towards the revolution, the Communists hope that the United Front strategy will bare fruit in time. The Federação Socialista das Associações de Trabalhadores (Socialist Federation of Workers' Associations) represents the moderate socialist trade unionists under the United Front, who maintain a presense within Portugal due to the lack of radical actions undertaken by them. Their small size has relegated them to an intermediary role between the CGT and the PCP.§!"

POR_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Partido Republicano da Esquerda Democrática     §gThe Democratic Leftwing Republican Party is a marxist, democratic-socialist party that formed in 1924, having split from Democratic Party following an ideological dispute with Afonso Costa. Leader José Domingues dos Santos has built the PRED around 'Moderação', an attempt to find a third way between the revolutionary syndicalism espoused by the Third Internationale, and the progressive liberalism of the Democrats. The failure of the 1930 General Strike has seen the PRED gain a small amount of steam among more radical minded exiles, though the CUFU still regards them with intense suspicion.§!"

POR_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Partido Republicano Português                              §gThe Democratic Party, offically called the Portuguese Republican Party, is a centre-left, progressive party which is the self-proclaimed successor to the original Republican Party which led the 1910 republican revolution. Formed in Feburary 1912 by Afonso Costa after the old Republican Party splintered, the Democrats were the politically dominant movement (with somewhat authoritarian tendancies) for much of the Republic's existence, until Sidonio Pais cemented his power in 1917 after which they acted as the main opposition to the conservative military dictatorship. After the restoration of the monarchy, Costa led his followers into exile and the party can be tied to almost every insurrectionist attempt to overthrow the monarchy since. Following Costa's retirement in 1931, the Democrats have been locked in a factional struggle between the populist lieutenant-colonel Liberato Pinto, who wants to reform the big-tent Democratic Party of old, and Costa's former deputy António Maria da Silva, a detail-orentated politician focused on consolidating the parties current ideology.§!"

The Nationalists were created to provide a stronger base to stand against the restored Monarchy, uniting the right-wing republicans under one banner. Their views are mixed, representing a wide range of interests and ideals, with their main unifying ideology being one of ‘Anti-Democrático’, or strong opposition to the Democratic Party.

Not explicitly monarchist at first, that anti-clericalism naturally drew the Catholics into opposition. When the Republic began to collapse, the Catholic Centre withdrew their support, with some key members turning to royalist militancy themselves. Following the Restoration, the Catholic Centre was the largest formal political party in the Royal Congress. Amid the disastrous year of 1925, the 'Centrists' reconciled with the Integralists following Hipólito Raposo's more pragmatic stance on political cooperation. Backing the coup in 1926, the Catholics now dominate the Chamber of Peers and have come to support a German-style semi-constitutional monarchy. Since a factional dispute in 1920, ardent monarchist and integralist sympathiser José Fernando de Sousa has led the party, though his advancing age has led a younger caucus of members around Professor António Salazar to gain prominence.§!"

When the then-political party was banned following the March 17th Coup, the members of the Cause were politically isolated from King Manuel II and forced to be mere spectators of the Organic Experiment. With the coronation of Duarte II however, the royalist coalition would have a new opportunity to reassert themselves within Portugal. Though the Monarchist Cause's official purpose is the continued protection and strengthening of monarchist institutions, their secretive aim is a 'National Restoration' to empower the Monarch and form a conservative personalist dictatorship around them, whilst culling the various excesses of the ultra-radical Integralist regime.

The group quickly became known as a counter-culture movement to the Republic, espousing an highly reactionary, traditionalist and elitist outlook on politics. Extremely anti-liberal and ultra-monarchist, the Integralists fought against the Democrats and the Republican system, though Integralist politicians cooperated with the Sidonist 'New Republic' dictatorship. As the restoration began, the Integralists were one of the most influential factions of the counter-revolutionaries. However, after the restoration, the Integralist's stagnated; viewed as dangerous by Couceiro, they were politically sidelined. Antonio Sardinha's sudden death threatened to collapse the organisation, but Hipólito Raposo rationalised the groups erosteric, often contradictory ideology and reconciled with other political groups, chiefly the Catholic Centre. After the disastrious year of 1925, the Integralists were able to lead a largely bloodless coup against the Causa Monárquica and swiftly consolidate power. Ever since, Raposo has put the Integralist's more radical ambitions on hold, which has led to discontent within the Central Junta.§!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_DUARTE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "As agreed in the Pact of Dover signed by royalists in exile before the Restoration, Duarte II inherited the throne from the heirless Manuel II. Since he was crowned in 1932, King Duarte has looked to strengthen ties with the Brazilian Imperial Family and with the British in exile in Canada, while at home keeping an amenable relationship with the Integralists, who fully control his government; a situation he will seek to change if possible."
POLITICS_MARIA_ADLEAIDE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "Having taken up the crown after the second Regicide in 30 years, Maria III has dauting tasks ahead of her. The young Queen has always been popular when she was a princess, always looking to help people in need whenever possible. Her gentle and good demeanour may make her aggressive anti Integralist position seem surprising, but since taking the throne she has denounced excesses from that party, and her fearless attitude only helps her popularity."
POLITICS_MARIA_PUPPET_DESC:0 "As the recently installed Queen of Portugal and the Algarves, Maria Ana I seems content in her role of doing little actual ruling. Her priority is ensuring the preservation of the Monarchy and in restoring ties with the deposed royal family. Her husband's German nationality, once a liability that essentially locked her out of inheritance, may very well help in this endeavour."

por.4.d:0 "After the disaster in the Weltkrieg, and the collapse of our forces in Mozambique and France, Portugal's usurper republic simply lacked the face and the military support to resist the Glorious Restoration, which brought Manuel II back to the throne, and his once rival claimant Duarte Nuno as his heir. The restoration, which occurred shortly after the war's end, saw the beginning of recovery for the economy. However, reliance on British imports and exports was too great for Portugal to properly weather the storm of 1925. We were unable to even unite our lands after the fall of the British Empire, for Germany, in an act of aggression, seized those lands. With such an extensive political crisis on his hands, the then Prime Minister Paiva Couçeiro called for elections; the victorious Integralists have an extensive reform agenda, while viciously anti-republican policies have polarised opinions even amongst the most staunch monarchists. However, they defer to the King for now, and they claim that they will so indefinitely. Spain's sickness seems to never end, as more chaos looms in the world and threatens Portugal. In Africa, Hermann von Göring and his Hunnic goons sabotage our endeavours, forcing our hand to return the favour, and tensions are fast escalating. But no matter what may come, we trust that Portugal will stand tall."

While the Kingdom's restoration, and other trials and tribulations it has been forced to endure, have challenged it, Portugal did not shy away from its civilising burden and redoubled its efforts to improve the Ultramarine Provinces, which are as essential as Porto or Lisbon. Many wonders and trinkets from all over the world have been brought to Lisbon for the occasion, including an entire Angolan village as an anthropological curiosity. While the endeavour was expensive, it reinforces our commitment to the Colonial Cause."

The machine gun fire did not gravely wound the Queen, Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, luckily enough, but innocent subjects of the Crown were gravely injured. The wounds of the 1908 terrorist attack were re-opened, and many in the Realm demand justice. While two of the 'soldiers' of the Legião Vermelha were shot down during the ensuing firefight, two terrorists spotted on camera, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, who are apart of the well known Anarchist brigands, have fled, presumably to seek refuge in the Spanish regime of the CNT-FAI.

Two men, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, have crossed into our borders while on the run from Portuguese authorities. Despite the successful assassination, public reception has not been unanimous and many bystanders were wounded during the operation. However, the men were armed here and, by all accounts, even without the approval of the FAI, accepting the Portuguese demand of deportation could be seen by the world as an admission of guilt; not to mention the men are likely to face execution if we hand them over. Also it is important to remember the weight of this decision on a global level. Starting a war against Portugal and their reactionary allies while we are in a weakened state and so recently after the Civil War may prove unwise, even with our allies behind us.

The King, his advisers, and parliament should be making the decisions about Portugal's future; not pampered intellectuals living in Lisbon or hiding in Paris. We will shape the Monarchy into something truly grand!"
por.313.a:0 "Vida Longa ao Rei!"

por.314.t:0 "The Burden We Bear"
por.314.d:0 "We must rise above our petty differences and unite under our Faith, our Country, and our People. And most importantly, we must bring the light of civilisation to the poor and unfortunate souls who need Christ in their lives. It is neither an expensive nor glorious endeavour to build outposts in the dark of the jungle and spread civilisation, but, nonetheless, it is our ultimate goal. And, of course, so is defending our faith against those who seek to destroy it!"
por.314.a:0 "Forward towards a better Portugal and a better World."

por.315.t:0 "Portugal Formally Rejoins the Entente"
por.315.d:0 "After the end of the Weltkrieg with the signing of the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in '25, Britain and Portugal have drifted further and further apart despite being in a formal alliance. But now, as dangerous times begin to threaten us, would it be wise to turn to our oldest friend for aid?"
por.315.a:0 "We will renew the world's oldest and greatest alliance, and beat back the Syndicalist Hydra."
por.315.b:0 "We'll refrain for now."

por.316.t:0 "Portugal Asks Us To Rejoin the Entente Formally"
por.316.d:0 "After the end of the Weltkrieg with the signing of the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in '25, Britain and Portugal have drifted further and further apart despite remaining in a formal alliance. But now, as dangerous times begin to threaten Europe, and the time to reclaim the birthright is fast approaching, Portugal asks us for support and will, in turn, provide support during the fast-approaching War."
por.316.a:0 "With the renewal of this treaty, we will stop Syndicalism!"

por.321.t:0 "Update on Mittelafrika: Police Officer Shot"
por.321.d:0 "Today we learnt that a Makonde tribesman has shot a Mittelafrikan police officer in Lusaka. The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with his supporters, have been detained for investigation by the local police. It appears we are already managing to destabilise the Mittelafrikan government. It should be noted that he used a weapon supplied by us, but we are confident it won't get traced back to us."
por.321.a:0 "Of course it won't be."

por.322.t:0 "Update on Mittelafrika: Military Depot Raided"
por.322.d:0 "Another update; earlier today some 'bandits' raided and stole supplies from a Mittelafrikan military depot and then escaped with the supplies back to their camp in Mozambique. Those 'bandits' were of course supplied and trained by us; they are getting bold and don't even fear the Mittelafrikan Askari any more! We have heard rumours that the Mittelafrikan government is having a meeting soon to decide what to do about these 'bandits' and the destabilising effect they are having."
por.322.a:0 "This might be trouble..."

por.323.t:0 "Fate of the Lusitanian Integralist Movement in the Face of the Dual Monarchy"
por.323.d:0 "With both Portugal and Brazil now falling under the God-blessed system of Lusitanian Integralism, many have suggested that our two sister crowns come together as one in a cooperative government under two equal crowns, uniting the Lusophone sphere under a dual monarchy headed by the royal houses of our two equal nations for the good of all true Christians in our sphere. Though this would likely be a logistical nightmare to pull off, the peaceful unification of Brazil and Portugal is well within our reach, if we simply reach for it. Alternatively, we could pursue a more truncated form of this dream, keeping separate states but united by a singular purpose, or we could just abandon the insane plan all together. What shall be the fate of imperialist and Integralist Lusophonic unity?"
por.323.a:0 "Ignore this pretender throne!"
por.323.b:0 "Work hand in hand with our brethren."
por.323.c:0 "Subjugate their regime and grant them fleeting autonomy."
por.323.e:0 "Unite the two governments under a dual throne!"

por.325.t:0 "The Fate of our Familial Ties"
por.325.d:0 "Although we have come to embrace God’s honest truth within this noble Integralist system, our brethren across the Atlantic have lost the plot as they drift towards false ideologies and godless heathenry in their pursuit of non-Integralist politics. Should we set sail across the sea in order to reunite Brazil and Portugal at long last under a single Integralist crown, or should we leave our old kin to rot while we chase our own destiny?"
por.325.a:0 "Set sail for our lost brethren to unite the Lusophonic world with Integralism!"
por.325.b:0 "Leave our kin to rot."

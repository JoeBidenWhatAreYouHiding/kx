KR_Poland: "Poland Focus Tree"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_POL_RADA_REGENCYJNA_DESC: "What was once established for the purpose of nominating a new king for the reborn Polish nation has quickly devolved into a useless apparatus thanks to internal disagreements and foreign influence. The Regency Council now stands as a useless rubber stamp for the decisions made by the legislative Sejm under the control of christian democrats. With the future being uncertain and the members of the Council being nowhere close to agreeing on a candidate, the Regency is not long for this world."
POLITICS_ROMAN_DWOWSKI_DESC: "Roman Dmowski was a thorn in the side of Germany throughout the Weltkrieg. While many Polish nationalists embraced the Germans as liberators, Dmowski, wary of Germany's assimilation of Poles in its east, favoured the Entente. His Polish National Committee was recognized by the Entente as the legitimate government of Poland during the Weltkrieg. With German victory, Dmowkski was forced to agitate tactfully and in secret; now as head of state, Dmowski is poised to seek renewed Polish national glory."
POLITICS_MARIAN_JANUSZAJTIS_DESC: "General Marian Januszajtis-Żegota has been a Polish nationalist for decades, beginning his career in Polish independence movements before the Weltkrieg. Always holding his nation’s interests as the highest value, Januszajtis-Żegota joined various patriotic organizations such as Zet and Zarzewie in his early years, eventually coming to support Dmowski’s National Democracy. During the War, he command the I Brigade of the Polish Legions. When the war ended, Januszajtis-Żegota was left disillusioned and embittered with the situation of the newly independent Kingdom of Poland, which he saw as nothing more than a Teutonic puppet. In 1919, the General attempted a military coup against the Regency Council, but was stopped by the joint garrison of German and Austrian troops remaining in Warsaw. This time, there are no foreign occupiers to save the collapsing Regency. Now, as general Januszajtis-Żegota solidifies his rule as the Supreme Commander of Poland, he can finally realize his lifelong goal of saving the beloved nation from all the enemies that oppressed her for so long."
POLITICS_POL_SEJM_DESC: "The Sejm is the lower house of the parliament of Poland. Historically, the Sejm was an assembly of clergy and nobility which, uniquely, elected the king of Poland. With no current head of state, the Sejm acts collectively as Poland's executive."
POLITICS_FELIKIS_DZIERZYNSKI_DESC: "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_FRYDERYK_KRYSTIAN_SASKI_DESC: "Fryderyk Krystian Saski, born Friedrich Christian von Wettin, king of Saxony, has ascended to the Polish throne. Fryderyk Krystian's status as both king of a constituent state of the German Empire and Poland is alarming to many Poles, who think him subservient to the Kaiser. Subservient or not, Fryderyk Krystian's coronation does indicate increased German influence in Poland."
POLITICS_KAROL_OLBRACHT_HABSBURG_DESC: "Karol Olbracht von Habsburg-Lothringen, Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate for the Polish. When Emperor Karl plotted to annex Polish lands to Austria, Karol Olbracht advocated fiercely against it. Though amicable to his native Austria, as king of Poland, Karol continues to fight for the Polish people."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_DESC: "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though upon his ascension he chose the name Władysław, to honor the first Jagiellon ruler of Poland, Władysław V is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Władysław has now also been crowned king of Poland, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'Eternal Regency'."
POLITICS_AUGUSTYN_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC: "Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, though not a descendant of any historical Polish monarch, has been enthroned as its new king. The Czartoryski family, ethnically Polish, were influential both in the days of the old Commonwealth and following Russian annexation. With Augustyn, the new Polish nation at last has a truly Polish king."
POLITICS_THE_TSAR_OF_ALL_RUSSIANS_DESC: "Poland, just as in the past, is under the control of Russia. Though careful to maintain the facade of independence, Poland is in effect a Russian puppet."
POLITICS_EUSTACHY_SAPIEHA_DESC: "Eustachy Sapieha has emerged victorious in Poland's latest elections. Sapieha is a monarchist; though, he has clarified that the monarchy shall only be restored with the consent of Poland's people. Sapieha himself rules much like a monarch; he is paternalistic and supportive of the aristocracy."
POLITICS_JOZEF_CHACINSKI_DESC: "Józef Chaciński, as many conservative polish politicians, was a member of the national-democratic National League during his youth. After Poland regained her independence he joined PSChD. Chaciński became a leader of newly renamed Christian National-Labor Party in 1926. With their victory in recent elections, he proclaimed that Poland will continue it's development under the ideals of christian-democracy and solidarism."
POLITICS_MIECZYSLAW_MICHALOWICZ_DESC: "Mieczysław Michałowicz, once a socialist, became disillusioned with leftism by the Bolshevik revolution. Michałowicz now champions individual liberty and the free exchange of goods typical of western liberals. Michałowicz has vowed, as president, to preserve Poland's democracy and the freedom of its people."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_WOJCIECHOWSKI_DESC: "Stanisław Wojciechowski, a political ally of Alexander Kerenskiy during the early days of the Russian Provisional Government, has achieved electoral victory in Poland. Wojciechowski, a self-described socialist, shuns the revolutionary ideas of the Communards and other syndicalist movements, and instead advocates liberal democracy with consideration and concern for all."
POLITICS_JAKUB_HANECKI_DESC: "Jakub Hanecki was the chief financial minister of the Bolsheviks from Lenin's return to Russia until the bitter defeat of the revolution. He fled the collapsing Soviet Russia under the cover of darkness, bringing with him troves of financial documentation and ledgers linking various foreign socialists to the revolution, and thus saving many from imprisonment or worse. Hanecki, with the death of Dzierzynski, has triumphed over his political rivals. He intends to inject much needed fiscal responsibility into the new socialist Polish government."
POLITICS_ROZA_LUKSEMBURG_DESC: "Róża Luksemburg's reputation precedes her; she is considered by many to the ideological progenitor of an entirely new strain of Marxism. Luksemburg, a Leninist, criticized the lack of internal democracy within the old Bolshevik party. She also advocates the necessity of a world socialist revolution; such is the only way, she argues, to secure the revolution at all."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_DESC: "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_2_DESC: "With the death of the king, Poland is again ruled by a regency council. Wary of a return to the turmoil of the 'Eternal Regency', Poles anxiously await the coronation of a new monarch."
POLITICS_LUDWIK_PIOTR_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC: "Ludwik Piotr Czartoryski, despite being a child, has directly succeeded his father as king of Poland. A comical image of the young king teething on the ancient crown, which was placed over his too-small head, has not helped assuage concerns that he is as of yet incapable of ruling."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_PLC_DESC: "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. hough upon his ascension he chose the name Władysław, to honor the first Jagiellon ruler of Poland, Władysław V is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Władysław has also been crowned king of Poland, and now a renewed union of his two kingdoms, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'Eternal Regency'."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_PLC_DESC: "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_FELIKS_DZIERZYNSKI_PLC_DESC: "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland-Lithuania for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_ROKOSSOVSKY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 21st, 1896\nWarsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to a mixed Polish-Russian family, Konstanty Rokossowski hails from the noble Rokossowski family, even though his father, a railway officer, was as removed from traditional nobility as one could get. Rokossowski had a difficult childhood, he lost his father early in his life and he had to abandon school in order to make a living for the rest of his family. He caught up by reading books in Russian and Polish in his spare time, only to fuel his life long conflict on whether he was Russian, Polish, or something in between.\n\nIn 1914, alongside his cousin Franz, the 18-year old Konstanty signed up for the retreating Russian armies and became a cavalryman, serving with distinction and achieving the rank of non-commissioned officer. They had to part ways when the October Revolution broke out, however - Franz joined the Polish Military Organization and Konstanty was one of the first to volunteer for the Red Army. There, he quickly rose in rank as a capable cavalry commander, but could not turn the tide - the Soviet regime collapsed and fell, and Rokossowski was forced to flee. \n\nAfter years of soul-searching across Europe, he ended up in France, where he came into contact with the Polish socialists in exile and enrolled in the French army officer corps. Though he maintains contact with the other former Bolsheviks, Rokossowski has grown distant from the Russian revolutionary cause and thus did not follow them to Argentina - his eyes turn towards Poland instead. Perhaps there, in his other homeland, he can find a purpose."

### Leader Traits ###
POL_german_commander: "Polnische Wehrmacht Officer"
POL_german_commander_desc: "The 'Polnische Wehrmacht' was the colloquial name for the Polish Armed Forces, military formations under the leadership of Hans Hartwig von Beseler which were an official part of the Imperial German Army. These units formed the basis of the future Polish Army created after martial matters were transferred into the hands of the Regency Council. Nonetheless, 'Polnische Wehrmacht' is still a popular name for the members of the German Mission. This officer has been sent to Poland to help in introducing military reforms. Their shared German-Polish roots will help them integrate with their Polish comrades."

POL_eternal_regency: "Despised Regency"
POL_eternal_regency_desc: "Almost the entire Polish population sees the Regency Council as a symbol of dependance on the Partition powers and pointless bureaucracy. Initially created to elect a new sovereign of the Kingdom, the Council got bogged down into dealing with internal strife and agents from their foreign masters. This has left the country to be mostly run by the elected Sejm, with the Regency Council being barely more than a rubber stamp, creating a curious case of a constitutional monarchy without a king.

POL_austro_german_squabbles: "Influences of Vienna and Berlin"
POL_austro_german_squabbles_desc: "The Kingdom of Poland was originally established as a compromise between the Austrian and German Empires.

With the bickering between their overlords, Poland was kept in a state of limbo for 20 years. But now, with problems growing for both of the Empires with each passing year, Poland may be once again freed from the shackles of their former occupiers."

POL_warsaw_garrison: "New Garrison, Old Fortress"
POL_warsaw_garrison_desc: "Despite Poland's relative independence on paper the armed forces of the German overlords are ever-present. The German Military Mission in Poland, colloquially and mockingly referred to as 'Polnische Wehrmacht', serves the purpose of ensuring that the Polish Army is both modernized enough to hold the eastern approach to Berlin if worse comes to pass and to monitor the force for any sign of anti-Pakt sentiments. Their grip on the throat of government is not only theoretical, considering that their headquarters are located in the old Modlin Fortress about 50 kilometers north of Warsaw. During the direct Russian rule of Poland it was known as Novogeorgievsk and was seen as the most vivid symbol of Tsardom's domination of the Polish nation. Nowadays the complex is known as Festung Beseler, rechristened in honor of general Hans Hartwig von Beseler who captured it during the Weltkrieg and also commanded the original Polnische Wehrmacht. Nonetheless, it remains a symbol of foreign influence, this time under the aegida of the Kaiser. "

POL_gdansk_agreement_desc: "Our diplomatic position is stronger than it has ever been in the past 20 years. We must leverage this advantage to send a diplomatic envoy to Berlin, requesting the return of the rightful territory of Plotzk to the Polish people. It is unlikely to succeed, but there is no harm in trying..."

POL_the_stab_in_the_back_desc: "The perfidious  Germans made many promises during the War. Of true independence, of stability, of prosperity. Yet as the teuton always does, they betrayed us, leaving Poland as a powerless Kingdom with no King. We had enough. The time has come to ready our bayonets to put the hunnic beast down."
POL_militarism_desc: "The people of Poland have been oppressed by foreign powers for far too long. Now with a government that truly cares for them in power, more and more people are joing the armed forces, not to mention the various resistance cells in occupied Polish lands.

If our nation is to survive, we must create a strong network of fortifications and border outposts to protect our heartland from foreign invaders. Poland will live as long as her brave sons defend her."
POL_opportunism_desc: "Developed more as a future bargaining chip rather than a full plan, Dmowski's Line is a hypothetical concept for the maximum extent of the Polish borders. While we cannot go that far, we shall strive to unite all the ethnic Poles in one great nation, free of any foreign masters."
POL_dismantle_gov_desc: "The old senate still exists, with all of it's faults and blunders. It would be wise to implement Endecja's plan of reforming it into a more meritocratic and effective institution in governing our state."
POL_imprison_politicians_desc: "Some of us still remember the pointless bloodshed of the 1905 revolution. While national democrats were trying and succeeding in gaining concessions from the Tsar, the fanatical socialists got swept by the revolutionary fervor and spilt Polish blood on Polish soil, gaining nothing in the end. We cannot allow that to ever happen again. The socialists have to pay."
POL_recruit_civil_servants_desc: "With all of the reforms behind us it is fair to say that Poland has been reborn. It's polticial system, most importantly, has been reborn. The age of misguided cleptocrats and backwards nobles is at an end. Today, we live in a perfect democracy, a national democracy!"
POL_ministry_of_prop_desc: "Our government is relatively young all things considered. Seeing as we had more than cordial relations with the Polish Episcopate, perhaps we could get an official endorsement of our rule from them. That would surely help to convince some more hesitant members of our society to support us."
POL_technical_colleges_desc: "A nation cannot survive without the technical knowledge of it's people. That's excatly why we must invest more resources into improving our educational institutions so the next generations can carry the torch of Poland far into the future."

POL_defensive_tactics_desc: "Poland finds herself surrounded on all sides by nations that have no love for her. If we are to survive, we must make it so that the enemy pays for every inch of ground they take with blood, and that our armies stand ready to defend every inch of Polish soil."

POL_new_airforce_desc: "Poland's air force is in a state of disrepair. We need to pull the air force out of the last war and into the modern era if we are to fight toe-to-toe with the other powers of Europe."

POL_modern_military_thought_desc: "No longer are wars fought in trenches and from strong fortifications. Modern military thought relies on swift manoeuvring and quick reactions. Our military staff must study these techniques in order to remain competitive on the world stage."
POL_military_desgin_bureaus_desc: "We must establish an official Polish Military Design Bureau to consolidate the many different research divisions in our military."
POL_integrate_wermacht_desc: "Poland, despite its relative independence is heavily reliant on the German military mission - or the 'Polnische Wehrmacht' as it is commonly known. The presence of the German Garrison is unpopular with both the citizenry and many Poles within the Armed Forces, who have grown to resent their German superiors; with such a divide in our armed forces being a continual source of frustration for those in the Army. To remedy this disconnect, the forces of the German Mission will be slowly rolled in with the proper Polish forces, ensuring equality between German and Polish officers in our forces."
POL_polish_war_effort_desc: "Once more the Russian Bear looks east, seeking to destroy the fabric of Polish nationhood we have worked so hard to weave. We in Poland - along with our brothers to the east stand as the final line of defense against Russian boots, linking together with them as an unstoppable line of defense. With the support of our German overseers, we will banish the Russian menace once more and restore peace and prosperity to Europe!"
POL_manstien_reform_plan_desc: "While the Old Guard may be thoroughly entrenched in Germany proper, experimental officers have had great success modernizing in areas outside of the German Empire proper. Once such reformer is the gifted Erich von Manstein-Lewinski - one of the highest ranking members of the German Mission. His radical proposals for modernizing Poland’s army have been dubbed ‘Schwerpunkt’ - which outline that mobile Panzer forces would lead the charge in the field, easily leading any offensive to victory. Hopefully the success of these tactics in Poland will help the Heer clearly see the way of the future."

POL_reincorporate_lithuania_desc: "With the growing relationship between us and Lithuania, and the collapse of Lithuania's old alliance in the Reichspakt, it is perhaps time to propose that Lithuania comes under our protection as a client state, so that we may better protect each other come a time of war."
POL_line_of_succession_desc: "Poland's 20 years of weakness were caused by the lack of a strong king to lead the nation. We must reform our laws of succession so that there will always be a King of Poland, and that a Regency Council will never again hold sway over the nation's future."
POL_join_international_community_desc: "As a new nation, it is our responsibility to re-enter the world stage as a strong and independent nation, and forge new ties where they were lost after the fall of the Kingdom."

### Events ###
poland.1.t: "The Economy Fails!"
poland.1.d: "Following the recent economic turbulence in the German Empire, our nation, which is heavily dependent on them in matters of the economy, is rippled. Our farmers are making no money due to the large decrease in prices of agricultural products and factories are preparing to fire thousands of workers. It seems that this year will be hard for the Polish people, both in the cities and in the countryside. What is more infuriating for the common folk is that the Regency Council is seemingly ignoring the fire they had a hand in lighting. The Sejm needs to take drastic countermeasures or our nation and government risks suffering a total collapse."
poland.1.a: "Pressure the Regency to finally do something!"
poland.1.b: "It's high time we got rid of that useless thing, abolish the Regency and declare the Republic!"
poland.1.c: "Mysterious visitors, dressed in cowboy clothes, appear and take charge!"

poland.2.t: "Bombing in Warsaw"
poland.2.d: "A tragedy has befallen Warsaw; yesterday, over fifty people were killed and approximately two-hundred injured in a deadly train bombing at the Warsaw West station. The police are currently in the middle of investigation on who the culprits might be, but all the available clues point to a fringe anarchist group known as the Polish Underground Anarchist Party. The assumed motive is vengeance against what they deem 'corrupt and decadent bourgeois' that 'does nothing when the people are oppressed and suffer'."
poland.2.a: "A horrendous day!"

poland.3.t: "March on Myślenice"
poland.3.d: "A major figure in the Camp of Great Poland, Tadeusz Bielecki, has mobilized his branch of organisation's youth wing and decided to march through Poland.

Of course, the whole situation got even worse when the local police got involved and a serious gun fight broke out."
poland.3.a: "Send the army in and arrest everyone involved!"

poland.4.t: "General Unrest Among the Farmers!"
poland.4.d: "Since our national exports have fallen, our economy is so weak that it cannot support production. Prices are plummeting and thousands of peasants are demanding the government do something about the economic crisis. Peasant unrest has spilled out into the cities and resulted in many violent incidents. Meanwhile, the police reports that they are having a hard time keeping peace in the entirety of the country."
poland.4.a: "Can this get any worse?"

poland.5.t: "Ukrainian Terror!"
poland.5.d: "With the incorporation of Galicia the number of Ukrainians in our country has increased greatly. The larger cities of Eastern Galicia are populated by a majority of Poles, but the countryside the opposite is true and there are a majority of Ukrainians. Disenfranchised Ukrainians who are very unhappy about being part of Poland and have set up an organisation called the 'Ukrainian Insurgent Army' that is starting to attack our military and government officials."

poland.6.t: "The Regency and Sejm in Danger"

poland.11.t: "Lithuanians and the Commonwealth"
poland.11.d: "With the Regency Council hard at work for the first time in its existence, we have received a very surprising offer from our former partners. The Lithuanians have declared a renewed interest in recreating the Commonwealth, and as such, have reached out to us to negotiate. The Commonwealth was once a major power in Europe, but it was eroded by the flawed noble democracy and the szlachta having too many privileges and too much power compared to the King and the common people. Those reasons are exactly why some inside the Council are warning us against pursuing a utopian idea of a reborn union between our nations. We can either accept the Lithuanian proposal or proceed with the election as planned, what shall we do?"
poland.11.a: "Agree to the proposal."
poland.11.b: "Ban Mindaugas from the election."

For 20 years the people of Poland have waited for the Regency Council to make a decision who is fit to lead our nation into the future. With the Sejm pushing the Council along in recent months the moment came sooner than many anticipated. There is only one question remaining as of now, before the members of the Regency officially announce their verdict. Who shall be crowned as the new ruler of the Kingdom of Poland?"

For 20 years the people of Poland have waited for the Regency Council to make a decision who is fit to lead our nation into the future.

Three serious choices have been presented in the past few days.\n Julian Leszczyński, head of the 'minority' faction inside the party, fanatically loyal to Lenin and the Bolshevik ideals.\n Adolf Warski, the formal leader of KPP and the biggest 'majority' faction, believer in a cooperation with other forces inside Poland to achieve socialism.\n Alfred Lampe, chairman of the Party's youth organization, more sympathetic to Communards' syndicalism than most of his peers."

While a week of mourning has been declared, the cracks slowly forming inside the Camp of Great Poland have become evident.

How shall the future of Poland look and who will be responsible for it?"

poland.73.d: "Our nation mourns the death of Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski, a distinguished Galician military figure from a long heritage of Polish leaders dating back centuries.

poland.112.t: "The Prussian Partition"
poland.112.d: "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lost much during the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. Many provinces were ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia. Now Germany is at war and we are strong; should we press claims on our former lands?"
poland.112.a: "Press claims on all our rightful lands!"
poland.112.b: "Press claims on the Prussian partition and Silesia."
poland.112.c: "We can't provoke the Germans!"

poland.117.t: "Revising the Polish-Romanian Border"
poland.117.d: "After the annexation of Galicia and Lodomeria, Poland obtained the territory of the Duchy of Bukovina. This territory contains a small Polish minority and many Ukrainians, while the southern part contains a large Romanian population. We could ask the Polish government to sell Bukovina, but we must be ready to pay them a large sum of money for the new territory."
poland.117.a: "Do it."
poland.117.b: "We won't buy it."

poland.118.t: "Revising the Polish-Romanian Border"
poland.118.d: "After the annexation of Galicia and Lodomeria, we have taken control of the Duchy of Bukovina. This territory contains a small Polish minority and many Ukrainians, while the south part of this Duchy contains a large Romanian population. The Romanian government has asked us to sell them Bukovina. They have already declared a willingness to pay us substantial sums of money."

poland.124.t: "The Great Debate Continues"
poland.124.d: "Initially established at the end of the Weltkrieg in order to choose the next King of Poland, the Regency Council is now merely a symbolic institution. Constant distractions, debates, and general inefficiencies have prevented the Council from doing anything of note for far too long, and have left Poland without a real head of state for years. Even now, debates continue in the Council over meaningless topics, and observers have little hope that any meaningful decision will be made in the next few years."
poland.124.a: "Unfortunate."

poland.125.t: "The Council is Distracted, Again"
poland.125.d: "Despite the recent tragedy in Warsaw, the Regency seems to pay no attention to the daily happenings in our nation. The latest hotly-debated topic inside the Council's chambers is the issue of the next king's height. While some of the members argue that he must be roughly equal to previous rulers, so that converting the statue size will not bankrupt us, others think that only the tallest of candidates is worthy of the glorious throne of Poland. No matter the stance of an average citizen about the disputed matter, everyone can agree that this won't bring the election of a new king any closer."
poland.125.a: "The country is threatened by extremists and they are doing this, reprimand them!"
poland.125.b: "It's hopeless."

poland.126.t: "Of Desks and Chairs"
poland.126.d: "With the tensions rising all over the country and situation looking more dire with each passing day, the Regency Council found a new pressing problem they need to attend to. It goes like this: 'A certain learned man once thought, is a large chair and desk space necessary to improve your cognitive abilities? A very interesting conundrum, if we look at the fact that...'. This issue has managed to split the Council in two factions, the so-called Deskophiles and Deskophobes. The former advocates for an increase in work space and a large and comfortable chair, while the latter thinks there is no change needed. Obviously the news of those talks didn't go over well with the average folks who suffer from the ongoing crisis. The Regency has already received over a thousand letters threatening to bomb their chamber if they won't stop their childish behavior."
poland.126.a: "No more desks, you will sit on the floor until you get to work!"
poland.126.b: "They will never stop, will they?"

poland.127.t: "The Council Regains Focus"
poland.127.d: "With the new bodyguards dispatched to the Regency Council's chamber by the Sejm, its members have finally started to feel a certain unease. The bodyguards, acting as representatives of the Sejm, explained the past month's events to the chamber, and the Council soon-after made a bold and unexpected choice to set out on their final debate on who shall become the new king of Poland. Perhaps this nation can finally have the monarch they have so desperately wanted all these years."
poland.127.a: "At last!"

poland.129.t: "Poland Looks for Protection"
poland.129.d: "With the recent election of [POL.GetLeader], Poland has been inching ever closer into our sphere of influence. This has culminated in their interest in joining our new military alliance as a member state, seeking our protection from outside threats."
poland.129.a: "We are stronger together."
poland.129.b: "We don't need those weaklings!"

poland.131.t: "Poland Requests Dominion over Galicia"
poland.131.d: "Poland, drifting further towards our sphere of influence since the election of [POL.GetLeader], has made an official diplomatic request for dominion over Galicia. The Poles have a fairly weak claim to the whole region, however their claim to Cracow is strong, where the majority of the people are Poles and would likely welcome a return to Poland proper. While their claim is weak, Galicia could be an important bargaining chip, perhaps allowing Poland to formally join our alliance. How shall we respond?"
poland.131.a: "Utterly ridiculous!"
poland.131.b: "Galicia is theirs by right."
poland.131.c: "They shall make do with only Cracow."

poland.133.t: "Poland Requests an Alliance"
poland.133.d: "Even with our rejection of a new Commonwealth, Poland is seeking to define a special relationship between our two nations, proposing a defensive alliance between our two nations, where each will agree to defend the other in a time of war. It is a tempting proposal, but how shall we respond?"
poland.133.a: "Of course!"
poland.133.b: "We don't need them!"

poland.135.t: "Poland Seeks Our Submission"
poland.135.d: "With the collapse of Germany and the Reichspakt alliance, we have found ourselves in a precarious position. We are few on allies and our future looks grim. Poland, seeing this opportunity, has offered their protection in the form of us becoming a Polish client state. Are we really that desperate?"
poland.135.a: "Unfortunately, we need them."
poland.135.b: "Never!"

poland.136.t: "Austria Denies our Request"
poland.136.d: "Austria has denied us dominion over Galicia, favouring the current administration over our own."
poland.136.a: "Outrageous!"

poland.137.t: "Austria Offers a Compromise"
poland.137.d: "Austria has rightfully agreed to return the long-lost territory of Galicia to our rightful control, and has begun enacting procedures for the transfer of territory. In exchange, Vienna has made a request for Poland to formally join the Austrian sphere, and has offered Berlin ample compensation if they are to allow Poland’s independence."
poland.137.a: "A Reasonable Request."
poland.137.b: "On Second Thought..."

poland.1370.t: "Austria's Request"
poland.1370.d: "Austria - a longtime ally of the Reich and long time influence in Polish Affairs has requested that the German Empire end their dominion of Poland, and following the will of the King, officially allow Poland to join the Austrian Sphere. If we are allow this to happen, we would receive adequate compensation and guarantees from Vienna against potential hostility."
poland.1370.a: "Allowed!"
poland.1370.b: "Denied!"

poland.1371.t: "Germany Denies on our Behalf"
poland.1371.d: "Our overlords have delivered news on the Galicia situation - and it isn’t good. They have formally denied Austria’s proposal and have declared that they intent to administer Poland long into the future. This is a dark day for our nation, as our chances of escaping German Domination have now grown slim."
poland.1371.a: "Cursed Huns!"

poland.1372.t: "Germany Accepts on our Behalf"
poland.1372.d: "As expected, our Ambassador from Berlin has accepted Austria’s proposal, allowing Poland to join the Austrian sphere in exchange for hefty compensation. In addition to economic concession from Vienna, a formal treaty will be signed forbidding Poland from declaring war on Germany or its allies, as well as allowing German Soldiers to move within Polish borders. This treaty has provided a remarkable increase in German-Austrian relations, which have grown somewhat cold after almost 20 years of peace in Europe."
poland.1372.a: "Sweet Freedom!"

poland.138.t: "The Return of Cracow"
poland.138.d: "While not outright denying our claims to Galicia, Austria has instead proposed that we take dominion only over the Polish-majority region of Cracow, and leave the rest to the current administrators. While this is not ideal, it is certainly welcome to own the historic city of Cracow again after all these years."
poland.138.a: "Our people, reunited."

poland.139.t: "The Accords Succeed"
poland.139.d: "Lithuania has accepted our proposal for a defensive alliance, and both nations now stand ready to defend each other from the threat of foreign invasions."
poland.139.a: "Just like old times!"

poland.140.t: "Lithuania Stands Alone"
poland.140.d: "Lithuania has refused our proposal for a defensive alliance, stating that they do not need our protection."
poland.140.a: "Then they shall die alone."

poland.141.t: "Lithuania Submits!"
poland.141.d: "In a desperate move, the Lithuanians have agreed to our proposal, submitting to our authority for their own benefit. This new relationship between our nations will surely benefit us both in the long term."
poland.141.a: "We shall care for them well."

poland.142.t: "Lithuania Defiant"
poland.142.d: "Lithuania has refused our offer of benevolent control, instead claiming that our offer is a grave insult to their ideals. Without our protection, they will surely be destroyed."
poland.142.a: "How could they?!"

poland.146.t: "Poland Seeks a Detente"
poland.146.d: "It appears the Polish question has solved itself. A telegram from Warsaw states that the Polish leader, [POL.GetLeader] seeks to rejoin the Reichspakt and build closer economic ties with Germany; as equals instead of subjects. It also appears they don't wish and/or demand any of their "lost" territory, though one would expect they may ask for such things in the future. With the Syndicalist in the west sharpening their knives and the bear in the east awaking from it's slumber, another arrow in the quiver is never a bad thing.."
poland.146.a: "Maybe the Poles have changed, of course they can join."
poland.146.b: "Unless that arrow is Polish of course, let them rot for."

poland.147.t: "Treaty of Posen"
poland.147.d: "After much pomp and fanfare, the German and Polish representatives have signed the now dubbed "Treaty of Posen", officially allowing Poland to enter the Reichspakt on its own accord. Though why Posen was chosen for this event appears to be a power move by the Kaiser himself, wishing to test Polish resolve. Many think it's a sign of the Kaiser's failing mental health, with him thinking Syndicalist's spies are after him. Either way, Poland is now a member of the Reichspakt and will serve for the greater good of it's community."
poland.147.a: "Wonderful!"

poland.148.t: "Poland Remains Alone"
poland.148.d: "It appears that the Germans, forever paranoid, delusional and bitter over our ‘betrayal’ have rejected our attempts to join the Reichspakt. Only offering minor platitudes of friendship, it appears the rejection of the German candidate for the now defunct Polish throne is still being held by the German Aristocracy and their wicked Kaiser. Poland will have to step out into the wilderness alone, but it is not as if we haven't done this before"

poland.148.a: "Poland is not lost."

poland.149.t: "Poland Seeks an Alliance"
poland.149.d: "The reborn state of Poland, a new nation on the European stage, is looking to us for their protection. The German and Austrian aligned powers they are surrounded by only stand to threaten them, and in a desperate move, they are seeking our help against foreign invaders."
poland.149.a: "Yesterday's enemy is today's friend."
poland.149.b: "This is surely a trap."

poland.150.t: "Russia Accepts"
poland.150.d: "Despite our past differences, Russia has seen fit to take us under their wing, giving us a strong ally against our adversaries in evil."
poland.150.a: "Unlikely bedfellows."

poland.151.t: "Russia Ignores Polish Pleas"
poland.151.d: "Seeking a diplomatic solution to our diplomatic isolation, we attempted to join the Russian Alliance in order to protect ourselves from outside threats. The Russians have denied our entry into their alliance, stating that the small Polish nation is of no use to their interests. Poland stands alone."
poland.151.a: "Our past differences were too great."

poland.161.t: "Poland Joins the Internationale?"
poland.161.d: "After their recent Syndicalist revolution, the small nation of Poland is seeking to join the ranks of Syndicalism worldwide, the Internationale. Should we allow them into our ranks?"
poland.161.a: "Our brothers!"
poland.161.b: "Their belief in our cause is flimsy."

poland.162.t: "The Internationale Grows!"
poland.162.d: "The French Commune has accepted our entry to the Internationale! We stand firm with our brothers in Syndicalism!"
poland.162.a: "The wheels of revolution turn!"

poland.163.t: "The Commune Dismisses Polish Interest"
poland.163.d: "Seemingly distrusting the new Syndicalist regime in Poland, the Commune has denied our entry into the Internationale, stating that our belief in their ideals is too weak. Without the help of the Internationale, our future in Europe looks bleak."
poland.163.a: "Impossible!"

poland.164.t: "Emergency Elections"
poland.164.d: "Normally the Sejm elections are held every 4 years, however, with the formation of the new Republic, we have sudden need to hold immediate elections to form the new Republic's Sejm. There are many parties that could come out on top..."
poland.164.a: "The Christian-National Labour Party."
poland.164.b: "The Polish Progressive-Democratic Party."
poland.164.c: "The Polish People's Party 'Liberation'."
poland.164.e: "The Polish Socialist Party."

poland.165.t: "The Situation of Poland in 1936"
poland.165.d: "Until the end of the Weltkrieg, there was no Poland. What had been Polish territory had been carved up between Austria, Russia and Prussia at the end of the 18th century, and in the face of scattered uprisings throughout the 19th, those three nations continued to hold on to their Polish territory. Polish fortunes turned in 1916, though, with the Act of November 5th, where it was granted autonomy from the collapsing Russia. However, this triumph came with a bitter taste, as the election of a Polish king was postponed again and again between 1921 and 1936 as Austria-Hungary and Germany squabbled about the nationality of a possible king and the exact status of a Polish kingdom. This has resulted in Poland becoming a weak constitutional monarchy in all but name, with the Regency Council serving as a mere rubber stamp for the decision made by the elected Royal Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland. With the popularity of the Regency at an all time low and an uncertain economic situation on the horizon, many ask themselves, what next? But, in such dark times, the brave people of Poland can take pride in their history of survival through adversity and say...."
poland.165.a: "Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła!"

poland.173.t: "Poland Invites Us to the Internationale"
poland.173.d: "Poland has moved on to joining the Internationale, leaving us in a precarious position on our own. Should we follow their lead and join the Internationale as well?"
poland.173.a: "We are stronger together."
poland.173.b: "We are stronger alone."

poland.174.t: "Ukraine Accepts our Invitation"
poland.174.d: "Ukraine has accepted our invitation to continue our alliance by joining the Internationale, following our example."
poland.174.a: "As they should!"

poland.175.t: "Ukraine Declines our Invitation"
poland.175.d: "Ukraine has stated that they feel our alliance has run its course, and our joining the Internationale goes farther than they are willing to go. They shall stand alone."
poland.175.a: "A blunder, surely."

poland.177.t: "Poland Demands Galicia!"
poland.177.d: "Poland has sent us an ultimatum, return their territory or they will take it by force. Their ability to make good on these threats is uncertain, but we cannot simply ignore their threat."
poland.177.a: "We're not in a position to refuse."
poland.177.b: "Never!"

poland.178.t: "Galicia is ours!"
poland.178.d: "The cowards have given in to our demands, returning our territory to us without so much as a fight!"

The German Empire is weak and distracted, and now is the time for the Polish people to seize what is theirs by right! Our forces have long prepared for this day, and only await the word to launch a surprise invasion of the German Empire and begin our campaign of revenge two centuries in the making."

poland.193.d: "Józef Piłsudski, who has been an influential figure in the Kingdom of Poland since its inception at the end of the Weltkrieg, passed away in his sleep late last night. Józef had been the face of the Polish military for many years and a strong political activist that many admired. His loss will surely leave the Polish military weakened and the future of Poland bleaker."
poland.193.a: "A great loss for the nation."

poland.194.t: "Marriage to the Sea"
poland.194.d: "Ever since the dissolution of our country in 1793, the Polish nation has lost our access the sea. But now, after almost 150 years of separation, we have returned to our long-lost love. To celebrate this grand reunion, many ceremonies are being held along the coasts under our control, where the Polish nation is symbolically reunited with the sea. Many of these ceremonies are marked with 21 gun salutes, Catholic services, and much general celebration."
poland.194.a: "We will never leave you again!"

poland.195.t: "Monarchist Sympathies"
poland.195.d: "With the Regency Council ousted from power and the new government slowly cementing its control over all state affairs, there are those who still seek the restoration of a monarch to rule Poland. They talk in hushed tones and move in secret, but they hold onto power all the same. If they are not dealt with, they may eventually find an opportunity to wreak havoc in the nation."
poland.195.a: "Very troubling."

poland.196.t: "Januszajtis-Żegota's Poland"
poland.196.d: "With the unruly monarchist factions now destroyed for the time being, and the military's control over the country all but absolute, many in the High Command are wondering if the General should do away with the farce of the 'Kingdom of Poland' once and for all."
poland.196.a: "The Kingdom is merely a fiction."
poland.196.b: "We cannot violate the sanctity of the Kingdom."

poland.197.t: "The Monarchist Faction"
poland.197.d: "Troubled by the increasing control the Marshal is having over state affairs in Poland, a large group of Szlachta and State Officials who continue to support the monarchy have come forward with an offer. If we guarantee their roles in [POL.GetLeader]'s government and take an oath that the monarchy will be restored in due time, they will give their full support to the current government of Poland. It is a promising offer, but how much can we really trust these men?"
poland.197.a: "We will make the deal."
poland.197.b: "They have no real power, begone!"

poland.205.t: "Monarchist Coup"
poland.205.d: "Late last evening, gunfire erupted from many different government offices around Warsaw. In the chaos, a statement was broadcast from within the centre of the city, declaring the restoration of the Kingdom of Poland, and the downfall of the current regime. There has been a deafening silence in opposition to this message, indicating a complete victory for the monarchist faction. [POL.GetLeader] has not been seen nor heard from since the coup began, and the monarchists have already placed Augustyn Czartoryski on the throne, cementing their victory over the opposition."
poland.205.a: "We should have known..."

poland.208.t: "Licensing a Panzer Design"
poland.208.d: "The '9-tonne Polish' programme has reached a point where a design must be settled on if production is to begin. There are many different nation's armour designs we may attempt to licence as a base for our design, but we may only choose one of them.\n\nWhich design should we attempt to licence?"
poland.208.a: "Let us choose the Commune's H35."

poland.208.h: "Let us create our own design, instead."

poland.209.t: "Signing the Pacta Conventa"
poland.209.d: "A long-standing tradition of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Pacta Conventa was a contractual agreement between the people of Poland and the newly elected king. These pacts were continuously signed by elected kings from 1573 to 1764 as a sign of good faith on the part of the monarch. This pact affirmed the king's pledges to the nation, and was written uniquely for each king to sign upon election to the Polish throne.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture of King [POL.GetLeader]'s ascension to the throne, the Sejm has written a new Pacta Conventa for the king to sign. A king has not ruled the Polish people for almost 150 years, and many have come to see the king's signing of this document as the de facto beginning of Poland's new age in the modern world."
poland.209.a: "With this signature, a new age begins."

poland.210.t: "Black Monday Hits Poland"
poland.210.d: "The effects of Black Monday are spreading throughout the economic world, and Poland is not immune to this disaster. Although economically isolated from most of Europe due to her political situation, Poland's economy still relies heavily on German trading.\n\nNews of this economic disaster has caused a run on banks across the nation, and people are already demanding that the impotent government take action. We can only hope to survive the coming storm."
poland.210.a: "Let us hope our economy survives."

poland.211.t: "The Fate of the Royal Castle"
poland.211.d: "Constructed in 1598 as the seat of power for Sigismund III, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has stood as the seat of Polish Kings for hundreds of years. But now, as the country has thrown off the shackles of Monarchist oppression, the Castle sits as a blight upon the worker's paradise that is Warsaw.\n\nMany proposals have been put forth on how to deal with this eyesore, but only one can be chosen."
poland.211.a: "Redesign it to serve the Syndicalist government."
poland.211.b: "Renovate it as a museum to workers worldwide."
poland.211.c: "Tear it down, and put a park in its place."

poland.212.t: "Monarchist Train Bombing"
poland.212.d: "Late last night a train arriving in Lublin was rocked by a large explosion which destroyed the railway and several train cars. While no civilians were hurt in the explosion, anti-government slogans were found painted on the side of the train, alongside messages praising the old Kingdom.\n\nLocal newspapers have already begun running stories on the "Monarchist Menace". It seems that the Monarchist faction is growing more bold in their actions."
poland.212.a: "We must deal with these Monarchists."

poland.213.t: "Monarchist Assassination"
poland.213.d: "Today on his way home from a long political meeting, the local governor in Lodz was killed by a small bomb being thrown at his vehicle. The bomb killed both the governor and his driver, and caused panic throughout the city. The assailant was heard shouting pro-Monarchist slogans as he disappeared into the crowds. Local police have been unable to identify the attacker, despite a hours-long search."
poland.213.a: "Damn!"

poland.214.t: "The Monarchist Militia"
poland.214.d: "Rumours have been spreading of a "Monarchist Militia" being formed in the Polish countryside in opposition to the government. While no real actions have been taken against the government as of yet, the fact that this "Militia" can be neither found nor dealt with is beginning to wear on the people's faith in the state."
poland.214.a: "The Monarchists must be stopped!"

poland.215.t: "20th Anniversary of Polish Independence"
poland.215.d: "There is celebration around the nation today as citizens of the [POL.GetName] celebrate 20 years of independence. The Kingdom of Poland was officially created with the signing of the Act of November 5th, which forged the new Polish state from the ashes of a failing Russia."
poland.215.a: "Here's to twenty more years!"

poland.219.t: "[POL.GetLeader]'s Inaugural Address"
poland.219.d: "As the first president of the new Polish Republic, [POL.GetLeader] gave a rousing inaugural speech today outside of Belvedere Palace, the building selected as the seat of the new presidency. In his speech, [POL.GetLeader] promised to unite all the Polish people together in these uncertain times, and made wide promises of reform and a movement away from the old days of the Regency Council. The speech was met with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, who came waving Polish flags and banners of the new Republic."
poland.219.a: "A moving speech."

poland.220.t: "Raising Modlin Fortress"
poland.220.d: "With the recent increase in tensions, our military is reviewing old fortresses for renewed service. One of the contenders is Modlin fortress, a massive fortification on the confluence of the Narew and the Vistula near Warsaw. Constructed by Napoleon in 1806 as a key fortification in his campaign against Russia, and later used by the Russians themselves, the fortress nevertheless still commands an important strategic position in the region.\n\nShould we renovate the fortress?"
poland.220.a: "Raise the fortress."
poland.220.b: "Our efforts are better spent elsewhere."

poland.221.t: "Poland Joins the Vienna Circle"

poland.222.t: "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Raszyn"
poland.222.d: "Earlier today the first broadcasts could be heard throughout the nation from the newest radio station operated by Polskie Radio S.A. in Raszyn. This radio station, the strongest in Europe, had a power of 120 kilowatts and could be heard from hundreds of kilometers away. This long-range station will allow all Polish citizens nationwide to hear the news and other important information from the comfort of their own homes."
poland.222.a: "A fantastic achievement."

poland.223.t: "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Warsaw II"
poland.223.d: "Continuing the expansion of their national radio network, Polskie Radio S.A. has today begun broadcasting from their second permanent radio station in Warsaw, bringing their total number of stations to five. These stations and their coverage of Poland proper ensure that Polish radio broadcasts reach Polish people all across Europe, even crossing national boundaries."
poland.223.a: "The Polish voice knows no bounds."

poland.225.t: "Deposition of the King's Brother"
poland.225.d: "Rising on a swelling tide of populist action, the "Red Hetman", as he is being called by the unwashed masses, Nikita Khrushchev, has moved to depose the current ruler of Ukraine, Vasyl I. Normally events in Ukraine would not concern the Polish crown, however, Vasily I was the brother of the current king of Poland, Karol Olbracht. Obviously such an aggressive action against the king's own brother is an outrage, and one we must deal with immediately."
poland.225.a: "We will not forget this."
poland.225.b: "This is an outrage! War!"

poland.226.t: "War with Germany!"
poland.226.d: "The time has come, for one of our greatest foes has come bearing down upon us once more. Germany, ever an enemy of the Polish people, now stands fimrly opposite us on the battlefield, ready to take all we hold dear. It is time for the greatest fight of our generation, where we decide the fate of Poland for generations to come."
poland.226.a: "We will fight to the bitter end."

poland.227.d: "The Kingdom of Poland, a small rump state born from the wreckage of the Weltkrieg in the middle of Europe, has had its government collapse in the wake of a Syndicalist revolution. We have strong economic and political interests in keeping the Poles within our sphere of influence, and this revolution transforms them from a weak backwater into a potential threat.\n\nLessons from the Weltkrieg have taught us the dangers of a two-front war. We cannot allow the Poles to consolidate their nation and potentially align themselves with the French Commune."
poland.227.a: "Draft a list of demands. This cannot stand."
poland.227.b: "We are busy elsewhere."

poland.229.d: "We have received a response to our list of perfectly reasonable demands, sent to the head of the Syndicalist rebels currently occupying Warsaw. The communication sent back to Berlin was so offensive and full of foul language that it was said to be more curse than communique.\n\nHowever crudely worded, the message was clear.

Initially, no response seemed forthcoming from the Syndicalist government operating out of the Polish capital.\n\nHowever, this morning a message was received that outlined Poland's willingness to cooperate on all [ROOT.GetAdjective] demands and to restore the position of the monarch as head of the nation. Initially, the message was believed to be a hoax or some elaborate joke. However, it was quickly determined that the message was in fact genuine.\n\nIt appears that the threat of [ROOT.GetAdjective] intervention has scared the Syndicalists into submission. The Polish monarchy is to be restored as soon as possible, under [ROOT.GetAdjective] supervision."

However, Germany has decided not to take action, seeing to focus on German Domestic issues over Poland.  "
poland.235.a: "It was not worth it."

poland.236.t: "What Doesn’t Kill Us..."
poland.236.d: "During the German attack on the City of Warsaw, the Kaiser’s forces utilized any and all underhanded tactics they could in order to gain the upper hand against our dug-in patriots and defenders. Using high-tech weaponry and state-of-the-art tactics, the Germans caused heavy damage to both life and the city around them. \n\nOne such act of needless violence was when a German radioman guided a Goliath tracked mine towards the Deanery of St. John’s Cathedral, detonating upon reaching the church walls causing widespread devastation. As the smoke cleared and we took back the city, it was revealed that only portions of the first and ground floors survived the blast, but so too did a single link of track from the tracked mine. Seeking to stick it to our would-be conquerors, the Deanery of St. John’s Cathedral has been repaired to nearly exactly how it was before the Battle for Warsaw. However, one change has been made. \n\nBuilt into the wall on the building’s north face where the Goliath detonated, the surviving piece of the tracked mine’s track was added to the structure of the church, complete with a small plaque commemorating the event. The whole process has come to embody the famous resilience of the Polish people, and the Church has become one of the most widely beloved and revered places in all of Warsaw. It is small showings of strength like this happening all across the nation that is responsible for our continued survival, and it is relics like this that we must defend in order to preserve what makes us truly Polish."

poland.400.d: "With Poland's place among the order of Europe precluding any belligerent means of reunifying with Galicia, we must approach the issue of reunification diplomatically. To this end, will offer Vienna them favorable economic terms and payments in exchange for our request. The only remaining issue then, is how far do we want our offer to go, a conservative offer for the western Galician regions with Polish Majority while an unsatisfying compromise to more nationalistic poles is likely to be permitted, while a push for the entire Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria while far more tempting, may sour negotiations out fo the gate."

While many regard this as a good chance to establish deep roots within the growing Polish economy, others object to the relinquishing of rightful Hapsburg land to this upstart nation."
poland.402.a: "A mutually agreeable exchange"
poland.402.b: "The western half of Galicia and no more"
poland.402.c: "Permit only the sale of Krakow"
poland.402.e: "All Galicia is ours, now and forever"

poland.403.t: "The Galician Purchase"
poland.403.d: "Austria, recognizing either the rightfulness of our claim or the value of our proposition, has granted us the entire Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a truly joyous day for the Polish people as we see the return of many lands thought lost since the partitions of age past."
poland.403.a: "A cause for celebration!"

poland.404.t: "The West Galician Purchase"
poland.404.d: "Vienna has decided to accept the Polish claim to Western Galicia, ceding Krakow and more to our nation, while hardly the greatest dream of the Polish people, this is a grand step toward the reclaimation of the Polish people."
poland.404.a: "Very good"

poland.405.t: "The Return of Krakow"
poland.405.d: "Seeing little value in our requests, fortunately, Austria has at least seen fit to grant us the historic city of Krakow, while hardly a bounty of land the return of the city has still added to our esteem of our nation in the eyes of the people."
poland.405.a: "A small victory, but it will have to do"

poland.406.t: "The Austrian Rejection"
poland.406.d: "Seeing little value in our nominal friendship, Austria has rebuked entirely any of our claims to Galicia, a truly shameful display."
poland.406.a: "What a disappointment"

poland.410.t: "Polish Border Realignment"
poland.410.d: "With our victory in the east, our Polish allies have seen fit to request territorial rewards for their contribution to the Reichspakt, staking claims from Vawkavysk to Volhynia. While accepting such a request would anger other close allies in Eastern Europe, it would solidify Polish loyalty and balance out the strength of the otherwise growing powers eastward."
poland.410.a: "Grant them Vawkavysk"
poland.410.b: "Deliver Vawkavysk as well as Brest"
poland.410.c: "Redraw the border up to pinsk"
poland.410.e: "The Polish border shall have what they desire"
poland.410.f: "Utterly ridiculous, we cannot betray our allies like that"

poland.415.t: "The German Rejection"
poland.415.d: "It seems clear that the Germans value their other allies more than the contributions of the Polish, for they have refused to grant us any rewards for our contributions to the Reichspakt."
poland.415.a: "What a disappointment"

poland.450.t: "A way for Poland to go"
poland.450.d: "A fresh arrival, or rather returnee to the world stage, Poland has seemingly decided to break with the alliances of it's former enemies to join with our's instead, ambitious and proud, they could prove a useful, if belligerent ally."
poland.450.a: "Poland can only rely on itself!"
poland.450.b: "The Ukrainians are slavic brothers, let us join them"
poland.450.c: "The Serbs are much like us, they will do nicely"

poland.451.t: "Polish Overtures"
poland.451.d: "A fresh arrival, or rather returnee to the world stage, Poland has seemingly decided to break with the alliances of it's former enemies to join with our's instead, ambitious and proud, they could prove a useful, if belligerent ally."
poland.451.a: "Another compatriot joins our ranks"
poland.451.b: "These firebrands will do us no good"

poland.452.t: "Poland is rebuked!"
poland.452.d: "Our choice of allies seem to have thought differently of us joining, but even if the world is against Poland, we will endure, Poland shall be it's own salvation!"
poland.452.a: "Poland is not yet lost"

poland.453.t: "Polish Overtures"
poland.453.d: "A fresh arrival, or rather returnee to the world stage, Poland has decided to break with the alliances of it's former enemies to form it's own power bloc in the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. And today, they have reached out to us to offer a place in their alliance."
poland.453.a: "We will build the future together!"
poland.453.b: "Such upstarts will drag us down in the deep"

poland.454.t: "The [From.GetName] joins our cause!"
poland.454.d: "Great news in the capital today as following our offer to bring the [From.GetName] into the [ROOT.GetFactionName], we have received positive a positive response from them. Already, diplomats between them and us transit between Warsaw and their nation to discuss shared military affairs."
poland.454.a: "We are not yet lost"

poland.455.t: "The [From.GetName] refuses us"
poland.455.d: "Dissapointing news as the [From.GetName] has rejected our offers of an alliance, presumably looking down at the only recently reborn nation, we will make do without them."
poland.455.a: "A shame"

poland.463.t: "On the Matter of Germany"
poland.463.d: "While the outcome of the recent Regency Debacle has not turned out in Germany’s favor, we are still shackled to the mighty behemoth in Berlin. Our government holds little love for German oppression, however we can not deny Germany’s prowess and strength; it would be foolish to anger them, especially at a time like this. We could seize the moment and proclaim independence at this very moment, or we could bide our time, waiting until Germany is tied up elsewhere to cast off our chains. Of course, we could always swallow our pride and stand by the Reich’s side for the time being."
poland.463.a: "We will wait for Freedom no Longer!"
poland.463.b: "We shall bide our time, and wait for the time to break our chains."
poland.463.c: "Begrudgingly, we will stand by Germany's side."

poland.464.t: "Poland Defies us!"
poland.464.d: "While we had hoped that the end of the Regency Council would lead to a favourable government being installed in Warsaw, the government that took over in the wake of Black Monday is not only unwilling to submit to Berlin, they appear to be actively hostile to German interests. The telegram sent to the Kanzler by the Polish Prime Minister has outlined that Poland will seek to declare full independence from Germany, expelling the Warsaw Garrison and nationalizing German business. Such disloyalty is indeed unacceptable, and we can not allow our Eastern Line to fall, many within the Heer are weary of starting a war directly on our borders."
poland.464.a: "This is unacceptable!"
poland.464.b: "We have little choice but to accept their wishes."
poland.464.c: "We can accept Polish Independence - but they must remain in the Reichpakt."

poland.4640.t: "Germany Demands we remain in the Reichpakt"
poland.4640.d: "Surprisingly the Germans were willing to accept our independence, however the German Kanzler has demanded that the Polish Nation remain as a member of the Reichpakt. Not willing to allow their eastern line to collapse, yet unwilling to forcefully bring us back into their grasp, Germany has offered us a peaceful third option - one that appears to be mutually beneficial. While many Poles continue to harbour bitterness towards the Kaiser, we can’t deny that we could use German protection."
poland.4640.a: "We shall march with Germany - as equals instead of subjects."
poland.4640.b: "No Concessions to the Huns!"

poland.4641.t: "Poland Defies Us!"
poland.4641.d: "The Polish Nation has rejected our goodwill and has steadfastly stood against even the most generous offers from the Reichpakt. The solution proposed was seen as many as a way to keep our eastern line intact while avoiding war, however with Poland’s brazen dismissal of our good graces, many have pondered if war is indeed the only option to keep the Poles in line. "
poland.4641.b: "Well, we tried."
poland.4641.a: "We can not allow such a hole in our Eastern Line!"

poland.465.t: "Our Moment Strikes"
poland.465.d: "The plans which our government has put into place in secret will come to fruition today. Germany is set to be busy fighting the Russians, allowing us the opportunity to slip away from the Reich’s grasp. Of course, such a hole in Germany’s eastern line would prove to be a great inconvenience, making a peaceful solution for Polish independence mutually beneficial. Outlining our demands to Germany could possibly lead to a path to Polish independence without bloodshed. "
poland.465.a: "The Hour of Independence is upon us, death to our German Overlords!"
poland.465.b: "This is the perfect time to present our demands."
poland.465.c: "We have changed our minds..."

poland.466.t: "Poland Demands Independence"
poland.466.d: "Poland has long been Germany’s eastern bulwark, standing as an irreplaceable part of Germany’s eastern line; losing Poland would put us in a precarious situation. With our war with Russia in full swing, [POL.GetLeader] has formally demanded Poland’s complete independence from German domination in exchange for Poland’s continued participation in the Second Weltkreig. Denying them would surely lead to a Polish uprising, however we could delay the specter of Polish independence until after our war has concluded. "
poland.466.a: "Grant Poland their demands."
poland.466.b: "Poland will earn its independence."
poland.466.c: "They shall be punished for their Insolence!"

poland.467.t: "Germany Accepts!"
poland.467.d: "Wonderful news, the German Kanzler had accepted our demands for complete independence, formally unshackling our nation from Berlin and placing us firmly in control of our own affairs. As thanks for this gesture, we will continue our participation in the Reichpakt and their struggle against the Russians. "
poland.467.a: "Splendid."

poland.468.t: "Germany's Offer"
poland.468.d: "While Germany hasn’t gone so far as to grant us independence, they have offered us a proposition: Germany will grant our nation full independence if we continue fighting side by side with Germany against the Russians, formally granting Poland full self governance upon the end of the Second Weltkreig. While this proposal is acceptable to many within our government, others seek complete Polish Independence immediately. "
poland.468.a: "We accept their proposition."
poland.468.b: "This is Unacceptable!"

poland.469.t: "Germany Denies us Independence"
poland.469.d: "Our demands to Germany have not gone over well with ministers in Berlin, who have denied our proposition with extreme prejudice. Any possibility of peace with Germany has now been thrown out of the window, as it becomes clear that we will have to earn our independence by bullet and bayonet."
poland.469.a: "War it is then."

poland.470.t: "The End of the Second Weltkrieg"
poland.470.d: "The rifles have fallen silent, as the final pockets of Russian resistance lay down their arms. With the Second Weltkreig coming to a finish, Germany has kept their word and has granted Poland full independence; proving our commitment to not be in vain. This peaceful transfer of power has further solidified the bond shared between our two nations."
poland.470.a: "A Deal's a Deal."

poland.471.t: "Poland Declares Independence"
poland.471.d: "Just as it seemed our situation could not grow more dire, we have received a telegram from Warsaw declaring their full independence from German rule. Such a hole in our eastern line presents a massive security threat, however starting a war on our eastern border could prove destructive and delivery crucial attention away from the Russian front. The Polish soldiers are quite dedicated, and if we send a firm message to Poland to stay neutral and demand access for our soldiers, we may just avoid a full scale war."
poland.471.a: "We can not allow this to stand!"
poland.471.b: "We must focus on the Russians, leave Poland be."

Some said that it's the papist god trying to stop our efforts, yet the more learned ones knew the truth. The coming duel between the forces of the Great Wanderer and his greatest enemies was fast approaching, and it finally came today. The revolutionary group known as Fighters of Human Freedom, or BLW, stormed the Lechitic Assembly in the capital. The battles around Warsaw lasted the whole day, with countless fires, executions and scenes of depravity. There is only one question remaining among the rubble of the city.

Then, came the direct assault led by general Bianchetti. Every holy icon, every cross, every monk and every hidding christian was burned on the pyre.

Be it to be granted inspirtation, commune with great figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte or even see what the future holds for our nation.\n Exactly during one of those future visions something strange began to happen, most importantly it was held by the highest memebers of the Inner Circle. While at first they saw everything they expected to see, later during the night they witnessed marvelous things. Technology never seen before, nations never seen before, people dressed in all kinds of strange outfits.\n\nOnly one question was on their minds at that moment. Shall we seek further wisdom?"

poland.313.b: "§RWe have unleashed something beyond our comprehension§!"

poland.314.t: "Temporal Rift"
poland.314.d: "No one expected what would happen next. The very fabric of reality began to dissolve around the Inner Circle. One by one they began to disappear from existence itself. The only one left was the Grand Prophet of the Circle, it seems that any malicious deity that caused this left him there to witness the strangest thing that ever happened in this world.\n\nHe saw his entire country transform into what was seen in the vision of the future. Eventually he gathered enough strength to stand up and ask one of the people what year it was.\n\n'What a strange question, it's 2022 of course'"

But that is exactly what happened.\nIn respone, the Neo-Confederates and Knights of Freedom formed their own armed militias to counter the ukrainian terror, with terror of their own.

POLITICS_POLISH_PAUL_SALVATOR_DESC: "Not much is known about the man titling himself as the King of Poles and Odorzans and a true descendant of the first polish dynasty. Most concrete sources say that Paul Salvator Piast-Riedelski was born in the german town of Jena and after reaching adulthood moved to live in Liverpool. After the British Revolution flipped the country on it's head, Paul was forced to flee England due to his moderate views and monarchist tendencies. In a twist of fate unforseen by anyone, not even himself, the strange man who wanted to be the King of Poland finally got his wish. A strong proponent of federalism and moderate socialist policies, will Paul I be worthy of Mieszko's legacy or will he lead Poland to ruin?"

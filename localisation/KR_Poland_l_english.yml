### Leaders ###
POLITICS_POL_RADA_REGENCYJNA_DESC:0 "What was once established for the purpose of nominating a new king for the reborn Polish nation has quickly devolved into a useless apparatus thanks to internal disagreements and foreign influence. The Regency Council now stands as a useless rubber stamp for the decisions made by the legislative Sejm under the control of christian democrats. With the future being uncertain and the members of the Council being nowhere close to agreeing on a candidate, the Regency is not long for this world."
POLITICS_ROMAN_DWOWSKI_DESC:0 "Roman Dmowski was a thorn in the side of Germany throughout the Weltkrieg. While many Polish nationalists embraced the Germans as liberators, Dmowski, wary of Germany's assimilation of Poles in its east, favoured the Entente. His Polish National Committee was recognized by the Entente as the legitimate government of Poland during the Weltkrieg. With German victory, Dmowkski was forced to agitate tactfully and in secret; now as head of state, Dmowski is poised to seek renewed Polish national glory."
POLITICS_MARIAN_JANUSZAJTIS_DESC:0 "General Marian Januszajtis-Żegota has been a Polish nationalist for decades, beginning his career in Polish independence movements before the Weltkrieg. Always holding his nation’s interests as the highest value, Januszajtis-Żegota joined various patriotic organizations such as Zet and Zarzewie in his early years, eventually coming to support Dmowski’s National Democracy. During the War, he command the I Brigade of the Polish Legions. When the war ended, Januszajtis-Żegota was left disillusioned and embittered with the situation of the newly independent Kingdom of Poland, which he saw as nothing more than a Teutonic puppet. In 1919, the General attempted a military coup against the Regency Council, but was stopped by the joint garrison of German and Austrian troops remaining in Warsaw. This time, there are no foreign occupiers to save the collapsing Regency. Now, as general Januszajtis-Żegota solidifies his rule as the Supreme Commander of Poland, he can finally realize his lifelong goal of saving the beloved nation from all the enemies that oppressed her for so long."
POLITICS_POL_SEJM_DESC:0 "The Sejm is the lower house of the parliament of Poland. Historically, the Sejm was an assembly of clergy and nobility which, uniquely, elected the king of Poland. With no current head of state, the Sejm acts collectively as Poland's executive."
POLITICS_FELIKIS_DZIERZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_FRYDERYK_KRYSTIAN_SASKI_DESC:0 "Fryderyk Krystian Saski, born Friedrich Christian von Wettin, king of Saxony, has ascended to the Polish throne. Fryderyk Krystian's status as both king of a constituent state of the German Empire and Poland is alarming to many Poles, who think him subservient to the Kaiser. Subservient or not, Fryderyk Krystian's coronation does indicate increased German influence in Poland."
POLITICS_KAROL_OLBRACHT_HABSBURG_DESC:0 "Karol Olbracht von Habsburg-Lothringen, Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate for the Polish. When Emperor Karl plotted to annex Polish lands to Austria, Karol Olbracht advocated fiercely against it. Though amicable to his native Austria, as king of Poland, Karol continues to fight for the Polish people."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though upon his ascension he chose the name Władysław, to honor the first Jagiellon ruler of Poland, Władysław V is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Władysław has now also been crowned king of Poland, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_AUGUSTYN_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, though not a descendant of any historical Polish monarch, has been enthroned as its new king. The Czartoryski family, ethnically Polish, were influential both in the days of the old Commonwealth and following Russian annexation. With Augustyn, the new Polish nation at last has a truly Polish king."
POLITICS_THE_TSAR_OF_ALL_RUSSIANS_DESC:0 "Poland, just as in the past, is under the control of Russia. Though careful to maintain the facade of independence, Poland is in effect a Russian puppet."
POLITICS_EUSTACHY_SAPIEHA_DESC:0 "Eustachy Sapieha has emerged victorious in Poland's latest elections. Sapieha is a monarchist; though, he has clarified that the monarchy shall only be restored with the consent of Poland's people. Sapieha himself rules much like a monarch; he is paternalistic and supportive of the aristocracy."
POLITICS_JOZEF_CHACINSKI_DESC:0 "Józef Chaciński, as many conservative polish politicians, was a member of the national-democratic National League during his youth. After Poland regained her independence he joined PSChD. Chaciński became a leader of newly renamed Christian National-Labor Party in 1926. With their victory in recent elections, he proclaimed that Poland will continue it's development under the ideals of christian-democracy and solidarism."
POLITICS_MIECZYSLAW_MICHALOWICZ_DESC:0 "Mieczysław Michałowicz, once a socialist, became disillusioned with leftism by the Bolshevik revolution. Michałowicz now champions individual liberty and the free exchange of goods typical of western liberals. Michałowicz has vowed, as president, to preserve Poland's democracy and the freedom of its people."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_WOJCIECHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Stanisław Wojciechowski, a political ally of Alexander Kerenskiy during the early days of the Russian Provisional Government, has achieved electoral victory in Poland. Wojciechowski, a self-described socialist, shuns the revolutionary ideas of the Communards and other syndicalist movements, and instead advocates liberal democracy with consideration and concern for all."
POLITICS_JAKUB_HANECKI_DESC:0 "Jakub Hanecki was the chief financial minister of the Bolsheviks from Lenin's return to Russia until the bitter defeat of the revolution. He fled the collapsing Soviet Russia under the cover of darkness, bringing with him troves of financial documentation and ledgers linking various foreign socialists to the revolution, and thus saving many from imprisonment or worse. Hanecki, with the death of Dzierzynski, has triumphed over his political rivals. He intends to inject much needed fiscal responsibility into the new socialist Polish government."
POLITICS_ROZA_LUKSEMBURG_DESC:0 "Róża Luksemburg's reputation precedes her; she is considered by many to the ideological progenitor of an entirely new strain of Marxism. Luksemburg, a Leninist, criticized the lack of internal democracy within the old Bolshevik party. She also advocates the necessity of a world socialist revolution; such is the only way, she argues, to secure the revolution at all."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_2_DESC:0 "With the death of the king, Poland is again ruled by a regency council. Wary of a return to the turmoil of the 'eternal regency', Poles anxiously await the coronation of a new monarch."
POLITICS_LUDWIK_PIOTR_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Ludwik Piotr Czartoryski, despite being a child, has directly succeeded his father as king of Poland. A comical image of the young king teething on the ancient crown, which was placed over his too-small head, has not helped assuage concerns that he is as of yet incapable of ruling."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_PLC_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. hough upon his ascension he chose the name Władysław, to honor the first Jagiellon ruler of Poland, Władysław V is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Władysław has also been crowned king of Poland, and now a renewed union of his two kingdoms, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_FELIKS_DZIERZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland-Lithuania for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_ROKOSSOVSKY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 21st, 1896\nWarsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to a mixed Polish-Russian family, Konstanty Rokossowski hails from the noble Rokossowski family, even though his father, a railway officer, was as removed from traditional nobility as one could get. Rokossowski had a difficult childhood, he lost his father early in his life and he had to abandon school in order to make a living for the rest of his family. He caught up by reading books in Russian and Polish in his spare time, only to fuel his life long conflict on whether he was Russian, Polish, or something in between.\n\nIn 1914, alongside his cousin Franz, the 18-year old Konstanty signed up for the retreating Russian armies and became a cavalryman, serving with distinction and achieving the rank of non-commissioned officer. They had to part ways when the October Revolution broke out, however - Franz joined the Polish Military Organization and Konstanty was one of the first to volunteer for the Red Army. There, he quickly rose in rank as a capable cavalry commander, but could not turn the tide - the Soviet regime collapsed and fell, and Rokossowski was forced to flee. \n\nAfter years of soul-searching across Europe, he ended up in France, where he came into contact with the Polish socialists in exile and enrolled in the French army officer corps. Though he maintains contact with the other former Bolsheviks, Rokossowski has grown distant from the Russian revolutionary cause and thus did not follow them to Argentina - his eyes turn towards Poland instead. Perhaps there, in his other homeland, he can find a purpose."

POL_eternal_regency:0 "Despised Regency"
POL_eternal_regency_desc:0 "Almost the entire Polish population sees the Regency Council as a symbol of dependance on the Partition powers and pointless bureaucracy. Initially created to elect a new sovereign of the Kingdom, the Council got bogged down into dealing with internal strife and agents from their foreign masters. This has left the country to be mostly run by the elected Sejm, with the Regency Council being barely more than a rubber stamp, creating a curious case of a constitutional monarchy without a king.

POL_the_stab_in_the_back_desc:0 "The perfidious  Germans made many promises during the War. Of true independence, of stability, of prosperity. Yet as the teuton always does, they betrayed us, leaving Poland as a powerless Kingdom with no King. We had enough. The time has come to ready our bayonets to put the hunnic beast down."
POL_militarism_desc:0 "The people of Poland have been oppressed by foreign powers for far too long.

Poland will live as long as her brave sons defend her."
POL_opportunism_desc:0 "Developed more as a future bargaining chip rather than a full plan, Dmowski's Line is a hypothetical concept for the maximum extent of the Polish borders.

POL_imprison_politicians_desc:0 "Some of us still remember the pointless bloodshed of the 1905 revolution. While national democrats were trying and succeeding in gaining concessions from the Tsar, the fanatical socialists got swept by the revolutionary fervor and spilt Polish blood on Polish soil, gaining nothing in the end. We cannot allow that to ever happen again. The socialists have to pay."
POL_recruit_civil_servants_desc:0 "With all of the reforms behind us it is fair to say that Poland has been reborn. It's polticial system, most importantly, has been reborn.

### Events ###
poland.1.t:0 "The Economy Fails!"
poland.1.d:0 "Following the recent economic turbulence in the German Empire, our nation, which is heavily dependent on them in matters of the economy, is rippled. Our farmers are making no money due to the large decrease in prices of agricultural products and factories are preparing to fire thousands of workers. It seems that this year will be hard for the Polish people, both in the cities and in the countryside. What is more infuriating for the common folk is that the Regency Council is seemingly ignoring the fire they had a hand in lighting. The Sejm needs to take drastic countermeasures or our nation and government risks suffering a total collapse."
poland.1.a:0 "Pressure the Regency to finally do something!"
poland.1.b:0 "It's high time we got rid of that useless thing, abolish the Regency and declare the Republic!"

The police are currently in the middle of investigation on who the culprits might be, but all the available clues point to a fringe anarchist group known as the Polish Underground Anarchist Party. The assumed motive is vengeance against what they deem 'corrupt and decadent bourgeois' that 'does nothing when the people are oppressed and suffer'."
poland.2.a:0 "A horrendous day!"

poland.3.t:0 "March on Myślenice"
poland.3.d:0 "A major figure in the Camp of Great Poland, Tadeusz Bielecki, has mobilized his branch of organisation's youth wing and decided to march through Poland.

poland.3.a:0 "Send the army in and arrest everyone involved!"

poland.4.t:0 "General Unrest Among the Farmers!"
poland.4.d:0 "Since our national exports have fallen, our economy is so weak that it cannot support production. Prices are plummeting and thousands of peasants are demanding the government do something about the economic crisis.

poland.4.a:0 "Can this get any worse?"

poland.5.t:0 "Ukrainian Terror!"
poland.5.d:0 "With the incorporation of Galicia the number of Ukrainians in our country has increased greatly. The larger cities of Eastern Galicia are populated by a majority of Poles, but the countryside the opposite is true and there are a majority of Ukrainians.

The Lithuanians have declared a renewed interest in recreating the Commonwealth, and as such, have reached out to us to negotiate. The Commonwealth was once a major power in Europe, but it was eroded by the flawed noble democracy and the szlachta having too many privileges and too much power compared to the King and the common people. Those reasons are exactly why some inside the Council are warning us against pursuing a utopian idea of a reborn union between our nations. We can either accept the Lithuanian proposal or proceed with the election as planned, what shall we do?"

poland.124.t:0 "The Great Debate Continues"
poland.124.d:0 "Initially established at the end of the Weltkrieg in order to choose the next King of Poland, the Regency Council is now merely a symbolic institution. Constant distractions, debates, and general inefficiencies have prevented the Council from doing anything of note for far too long, and have left Poland without a real head of state for years. Even now, debates continue in the Council over meaningless topics, and observers have little hope that any meaningful decision will be made in the next few years."
poland.124.a:0 "Unfortunate."

poland.125.t:0 "The Council is Distracted, Again"
poland.125.d:0 "Despite the recent tragedy in Warsaw, the Regency seems to pay no attention to the daily happenings in our nation. The latest hotly-debated topic inside the Council's chambers is the issue of the next king's height. While some of the members argue that he must be roughly equal to previous rulers, so that converting the statue size will not bankrupt us, others think that only the tallest of candidates is worthy of the glorious throne of Poland. No matter the stance of an average citizen about the disputed matter, everyone can agree that this won't bring the election of a new king any closer."
poland.125.a:0 "The country is threatened by extremists and they are doing this, reprimand them!"
poland.125.b:0 "It's hopeless."

poland.126.t:0 "Of Desks and Chairs"
poland.126.d:0 "With the tensions rising all over the country and situation looking more dire with each passing day, the Regency Council found a new pressing problem they need to attend to. It goes like this: 'A certain learned man once thought, is a large chair and desk space necessary to improve your cognitive abilities? A very interesting conundrum, if we look at the fact that...'. This issue has managed to split the Council in two factions, the so-called Deskophiles and Deskophobes. The former advocates for an increase in work space and a large and comfortable chair, while the latter thinks there is no change needed. Obviously the news of those talks didn't go over well with the average folks who suffer from the ongoing crisis. The Regency has already received over a thousand letters threatening to bomb their chamber if they won't stop their childish behavior."
poland.126.a:0 "No more desks, you will sit on the floor until you get to work!"
poland.126.b:0 "They will never stop, will they?"

poland.127.t:0 "The Council Regains Focus"
poland.127.d:0 "With the new bodyguards dispatched to the Regency Council's chamber by the Sejm, its members have finally started to feel a certain unease. The bodyguards, acting as representatives of the Sejm, explained the past month's events to the chamber, and the Council soon-after made a bold and unexpected choice to set out on their final debate on who shall become the new king of Poland. Perhaps this nation can finally have the monarch they have so desperately wanted all these years."
poland.127.a:0 "At last!"

poland.129.t:0 "Poland Looks for Protection"
poland.129.d:0 "With the recent election of [POL.GetLeader], Poland has been inching ever closer into our sphere of influence. This has culminated in their interest in joining our new military alliance as a member state, seeking our protection from outside threats."
poland.129.a:0 "We are stronger together."
poland.129.b:0 "We don't need those weaklings!"

poland.131.t:0 "Poland Requests Dominion over Galicia"
poland.131.d:0 "Poland, firmly in our sphere of influence since the election of [POL.GetLeader], has made an official diplomatic request for dominion over Galicia. The Poles have a fairly weak claim to the whole region, however their claim to Cracow is strong, where the majority of the people are Poles and would likely welcome a return to Poland proper. How shall we respond?"
poland.131.a:0 "Utterly ridiculous!"
poland.131.b:0 "Galicia is theirs by right."
poland.131.c:0 "They shall make do with only Cracow."

poland.133.t:0 "Poland Requests an Alliance"
poland.133.d:0 "Even with our rejection of a new Commonwealth, Poland is seeking to define a special relationship between our two nations, proposing a defensive alliance between our two nations, where each will agree to defend the other in a time of war. It is a tempting proposal, but how shall we respond?"
poland.133.a:0 "Of course!"
poland.133.b:0 "We don't need them!"

poland.135.t:0 "Poland Seeks Our Submission"
poland.135.d:0 "With the collapse of Germany and the Reichspakt alliance, we have found ourselves in a precarious position. We are few on allies and our future looks grim. Poland, seeing this opportunity, has offered their protection in the form of us becoming a Polish client state. Are we really that desperate?"

poland.137.d:0 "Austria has rightfully agreed to return the long-lost territory of Galicia to our rightful control, and has begun enacting procedures for the transfer of territory. This is a wonderful day for the Polish people."
poland.137.a:0 "Fantastic!"

poland.138.t:0 "The Return of Cracow"
poland.138.d:0 "While not outright denying our claims to Galicia, Austria has instead proposed that we take dominion only over the Polish-majority region of Cracow, and leave the rest to the current administrators. While this is not ideal, it is certainly welcome to own the historic city of Cracow again after all these years."
poland.138.a:0 "Our people, reunited."

poland.139.t:0 "The Accords Succeed"
poland.139.d:0 "Lithuania has accepted our proposal for a defensive alliance, and both nations now stand ready to defend each other from the threat of foreign invasions."

poland.140.t:0 "Lithuania Stands Alone"
poland.140.d:0 "Lithuania has refused our proposal for a defensive alliance, stating that they do not need our protection."
poland.140.a:0 "Then they shall die alone."

poland.141.t:0 "Lithuania Submits!"
poland.141.d:0 "In a desperate move, the Lithuanians have agreed to our proposal, submitting to our authority for their own benefit. This new relationship between our nations will surely benefit us both in the long term."
poland.141.a:0 "We shall care for them well."

poland.142.t:0 "Lithuania Defiant"
poland.142.d:0 "Lithuania has refused our offer of benevolent control, instead claiming that our offer is a grave insult to their ideals. Without our protection, they will surely be destroyed."
poland.142.a:0 "How could they?!"

poland.146.t:0 "Poland Seeks a Detente"
poland.146.d:0 "It appears the Polish question has solved itself. A telegram from Warsaw states that the Polish leader, [POL.GetLeader] seeks to join the Reichspakt and closer economic ties with Germany. It also appears they don't wish and/or demand any of their "lost" territory, though one would expect they may ask for such things in the future. With the Syndicalist in the west sharpening their knives and the bear in the east awaking from it's slumber, another arrow in the quiver is never a bad thing.."
poland.146.a:0 "Maybe the Poles have changed, of course they can join."
poland.146.b:0 "Unless that arrow is Polish of course, let them rot for."

poland.147.t:0 "Treaty of Posen"
poland.147.d:0 "After much pomp and fanfare, the German and Polish representatives have signed the now dubbed "Treaty of Posen", officially allowing Poland to enter the Reichspakt. Though why Posen was chosen for this event appears to be a power move by the Kaiser himself, wishing to test Polish resolve. Many think it's a sign of the Kaiser's failing mental health, with him thinking Syndicalist's spies are after him. Either way, Poland is now a member of the Reichspakt and will serve for the greater good of it's community."
poland.147.a:0 "Wonderful!"

poland.148.t:0 "Poland Remains Alone"
poland.148.d:0 "It appears that the Germans, forever paranoid and delusional have rejected our attempts to join the Reichspakt. Only offering minor platitudes of friendship, it appears the rejection of the German candidate for the now defunct Polish throne is still being held by the German Aristocracy and their wicked Kaiser. Poland will have to step out into the wilderness alone, but it is not as if we haven't done this before"
poland.148.a:0 "Poland is not lost."

poland.149.t:0 "Poland Seeks an Alliance"
poland.149.d:0 "The small Republic of Poland, a new nation on the European stage, is looking to us for their protection. The monarchies they are surrounded by only stand to threaten the new republic, and in a desperate move, they are seeking our help against foreign invaders."

poland.151.t:0 "Russia Ignores Polish Pleas"
poland.151.d:0 "Seeking a diplomatic solution to our diplomatic isolation, we attempted to join the Russian Alliance in order to protect ourselves from outside threats.

poland.165.d:0 "Until the end of the Weltkrieg, there was no Poland. What had been Polish territory had been carved up between Austria, Russia and Prussia at the end of the 18th century, and in the face of scattered uprisings throughout the 19th, those three nations continued to hold on to their Polish territory. Polish fortunes turned in 1916, though, with the Act of November 5th, where it was granted autonomy from the collapsing Russia. However, this triumph came with a bitter taste, as the election of a Polish king was postponed again and again between 1921 and 1936 as Austria-Hungary and Germany squabbled about the nationality of a possible king and the exact status of a Polish kingdom. This has resulted in Poland becoming a weak constitutional monarchy in all but name, with the Regency Council serving as a mere rubber stamp for the decision made by the elected Royal Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland. With the popularity of the Regency at an all time low and an uncertain economic situation on the horizon, many ask themselves, what next? But, in such dark times, the brave people of Poland can take pride in their history of survival through adversity and say...."

In the chaos, a statement was broadcast from within the centre of the city, declaring the restoration of the Kingdom of Poland, and the downfall of the current regime. There has been a deafening silence in opposition to this message, indicating a complete victory for the monarchist faction. [POL.GetLeader] has not been seen nor heard from since the coup began, and the monarchists have already placed Augustyn Czartoryski on the throne, cementing their victory over the opposition."
poland.205.a:0 "We should have known..."

poland.208.t:0 "Licensing a Panzer Design"
poland.208.d:0 "The '9-tonne Polish' programme has reached a point where a design must be settled on if production is to begin. There are many different nation's armour designs we may attempt to licence as a base for our design, but we may only choose one of them.\n\nWhich design should we attempt to licence?"
poland.208.a:0 "Let us choose the Commune's H35."
poland.208.b:0 "Let us choose the German Kätzchen."
poland.208.c:0 "Let us choose the Austrian Panzer L.20 Pfau."
poland.208.e:0 "Let us choose the Canadian Vickers LT III."
poland.208.f:0 "Let us choose the Russian T-25."
poland.208.h:0 "Let us create our own design, instead."

poland.209.t:0 "Signing the Pacta Conventa"
poland.209.d:0 "A long-standing tradition of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Pacta Conventa was a contractual agreement between the people of Poland and the newly elected king. These pacts were continuously signed by elected kings from 1573 to 1764 as a sign of good faith on the part of the monarch. This pact affirmed the king's pledges to the nation, and was written uniquely for each king to sign upon election to the Polish throne.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture of King [POL.GetLeader]'s ascension to the throne, the Sejm has written a new Pacta Conventa for the king to sign. A king has not ruled the Polish people for almost 150 years, and many have come to see the king's signing of this document as the de facto beginning of Poland's new age in the modern world."
poland.209.a:0 "With this signature, a new age begins."

poland.210.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Poland"
poland.210.d:0 "The effects of Black Monday are spreading throughout the economic world, and Poland is not immune to this disaster. Although economically isolated from most of Europe due to her political situation, Poland's economy still relies heavily on German trading.\n\nNews of this economic disaster has caused a run on banks across the nation, and people are already demanding that the impotent government take action. We can only hope to survive the coming storm."
poland.210.a:0 "Let us hope our economy survives."

poland.211.t:0 "The Fate of the Royal Castle"
poland.211.d:0 "Constructed in 1598 as the seat of power for Sigismund III, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has stood as the seat of Polish Kings for hundreds of years. But now, as the country has thrown off the shackles of Monarchist oppression, the Castle sits as a blight upon the worker's paradise that is Warsaw.\n\nMany proposals have been put forth on how to deal with this eyesore, but only one can be chosen."
poland.211.a:0 "Redesign it to serve the Syndicalist government."
poland.211.b:0 "Renovate it as a museum to workers worldwide."
poland.211.c:0 "Tear it down, and put a park in its place."

poland.212.t:0 "Monarchist Train Bombing"
poland.212.d:0 "Late last night a train arriving in Lublin was rocked by a large explosion which destroyed the railway and several train cars. While no civilians were hurt in the explosion, anti-government slogans were found painted on the side of the train, alongside messages praising the old Kingdom.\n\nLocal newspapers have already begun running stories on the "Monarchist Menace". It seems that the Monarchist faction is growing more bold in their actions."
poland.212.a:0 "We must deal with these Monarchists."

poland.213.t:0 "Monarchist Assassination"
poland.213.d:0 "Today on his way home from a long political meeting, the local governor in Lodz was killed by a small bomb being thrown at his vehicle. The bomb killed both the governor and his driver, and caused panic throughout the city. The assailant was heard shouting pro-Monarchist slogans as he disappeared into the crowds. Local police have been unable to identify the attacker, despite a hours-long search."
poland.213.a:0 "Damn!"

poland.214.t:0 "The Monarchist Militia"
poland.214.d:0 "Rumours have been spreading of a "Monarchist Militia" being formed in the Polish countryside in opposition to the government. While no real actions have been taken against the government as of yet, the fact that this "Militia" can be neither found nor dealt with is beginning to wear on the people's faith in the state."
poland.214.a:0 "The Monarchists must be stopped!"

poland.215.t:0 "20th Anniversary of Polish Independence"
poland.215.d:0 "There is celebration around the nation today as citizens of the [POL.GetName] celebrate 20 years of independence. The Kingdom of Poland was officially created with the signing of the Act of November 5th, which forged the new Polish state from the ashes of a failing Russia."
poland.215.a:0 "Here's to twenty more years!"

poland.219.t:0 "[POL.GetLeader]'s Inaugural Address"
poland.219.d:0 "As the first president of the new Polish Republic, [POL.GetLeader] gave a rousing inaugural speech today outside of Belvedere Palace, the building selected as the seat of the new presidency. In his speech, [POL.GetLeader] promised to unite all the Polish people together in these uncertain times, and made wide promises of reform and a movement away from the old days of the Regency Council. The speech was met with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, who came waving Polish flags and banners of the new Republic."
poland.219.a:0 "A moving speech."

poland.220.t:0 "Raising Modlin Fortress"
poland.220.d:0 "With the recent increase in tensions, our military is reviewing old fortresses for renewed service. One of the contenders is Modlin fortress, a massive fortification on the confluence of the Narew and the Vistula near Warsaw. Constructed by Napoleon in 1806 as a key fortification in his campaign against Russia, and later used by the Russians themselves, the fortress nevertheless still commands an important strategic position in the region.\n\nShould we renovate the fortress?"
poland.220.a:0 "Raise the fortress."
poland.220.b:0 "Our efforts are better spent elsewhere."

poland.221.t:0 "Poland Joins the Vienna Circle"
poland.221.d:0 "Responding to our expansion of the Vienna Circle, our dynastic relatives in Poland have made apparent their desire to join, and have sent their own representatives to Vienna to participate."
poland.221.a:0 "They are most welcome."
poland.222.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Raszyn"
poland.222.d:0 "Earlier today the first broadcasts could be heard throughout the nation from the newest radio station operated by Polskie Radio S.A. in Raszyn. This radio station, the strongest in Europe, had a power of 120 kilowatts and could be heard from hundreds of kilometers away. This long-range station will allow all Polish citizens nationwide to hear the news and other important information from the comfort of their own homes."
poland.222.a:0 "A fantastic achievement."

poland.223.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Warsaw II"
poland.223.d:0 "Continuing the expansion of their national radio network, Polskie Radio S.A. has today begun broadcasting from their second permanent radio station in Warsaw, bringing their total number of stations to five. These stations and their coverage of Poland proper ensure that Polish radio broadcasts reach Polish people all across Europe, even crossing national boundaries."
poland.223.a:0 "The Polish voice knows no bounds."

poland.225.t:0 "Deposition of the King's Brother"
poland.225.d:0 "Rising on a swelling tide of populist action, the "Red Hetman", as he is being called by the unwashed masses, Nikita Khrushchev, has moved to depose the current ruler of Ukraine, Vasyl I. Normally events in Ukraine would not concern the Polish crown, however, Vasily I was the brother of the current king of Poland, Karol Olbracht. Obviously such an aggressive action against the king's own brother is an outrage, and one we must deal with immediately."
poland.225.a:0 "We will not forget this."
poland.225.b:0 "This is an outrage! War!"

poland.226.t:0 "War with Germany!"
poland.226.d:0 "The time has come, for one of our greatest foes has come bearing down upon us once more. Germany, ever an enemy of the Polish people, now stands fimrly opposite us on the battlefield, ready to take all we hold dear. It is time for the greatest fight of our generation, where we decide the fate of Poland for generations to come."
poland.226.a:0 "We will fight to the bitter end."

poland.227.t:0 "Poland's Syndicalist Revolution"
poland.227.d:0 "The Kingdom of Poland, a small rump state born from the wreckage of the Weltkrieg in the middle of Europe, has had its government collapse in the wake of a Syndicalist revolution. We have strong economic and political interests in keeping the Poles within our sphere of influence, and this revolution transforms them from a weak backwater into a potential threat.\n\nLessons from the Weltkrieg have taught us the dangers of a two-front war. We cannot allow the Poles to consolidate their nation and potentially align themselves with the French Commune."
poland.227.a:0 "Draft a list of demands. This cannot stand."
poland.227.b:0 "We are busy elsewhere."

poland.228.t:0 "Germany Sends Demands"
poland.228.d:0 "German observers in Poland, previously sidelined by the near-total collapse of the old regime, today quietly delivered a missive to the office of the new Syndicalist head of state, comrade [POL.GetLeader].\n\nThe note came from the German foreign office, and its message was as vindictive as it was clear. The new Polish government was in no way recognized by the German Empire, as is seen as a rebel force fighting in defiance of the true government of the Kingdom of Poland. The current 'rebels' were to submit to a list of no less than 16 demands, and to retreat from their offices in Warsaw, to be replaced by 'proper authorities' under German supervision.\n\nIt is clear that this list of demands was never meant to be accepted, and is nothing but a pretext for an imperialist German war."
poland.228.a:0 "This is outrageous, the Kaiser has no power here!"
poland.228.b:0 "We are surrounded by German puppets, to fight is to die."

poland.229.t:0 "Poland Refuses to Surrender"
poland.229.d:0 "We have received a response to our list of perfectly reasonable demands, sent to the head of the Syndicalist rebels currently occupying Warsaw. The communication sent back to Berlin was so offensive and full of foul language that it was said to be more curse than communique.\n\nHowever crudely worded, the message was clear. The Syndicalists will not submit to proper German authority, and we have acquired a reasonable casus belli to remove them from our borders."
poland.229.a:0 "Crush them."

poland.230.t:0 "Poland Agrees to Cooperation"
poland.230.d:0 "We have received a response to our list of perfectly reasonable demands, sent to the head of the Syndicalist rebels currently occupying Warsaw. Initially, no response seemed forthcoming from the Syndicalist government operating out of the Polish capital.\n\nHowever, this morning a message was received that outlined Poland's willingness to cooperate on all German demands and to restore the position of the monarch as head of the nation. Initially, the message was believed to be a hoax or some elaborate joke. However, it was quickly determined that the message was in fact genuine.\n\nIt appears that the threat of German intervention has scared the Syndicalists into submission. The Polish monarchy is to be restored as soon as possible, under German supervision."
poland.230.a:0 "They have seen the light."

poland.231.t:0 "Restoration of the Monarchy"
poland.231.d:0 "Today the Polish monarchy saw its restoration under the eyes of a strict German military presence. All remnants of the short-lived Syndicalist regime have been removed from the public eye, and most Syndicalist leaders of note have fled into hiding.\n\nFor his part, the new Polish king, the German Friedrich Christian von Wettin, promised to uphold the will of the Polish people, and promised an era of healing and reconciliation between the Polish and German peoples. Poland has entered a new era in its history."
poland.231.a:0 "We have been humiliated, but the regency is over."

poland.232.t:0 "German Monopolies Crash"
poland.232.d:0 "In the wake of Germany's quick economic meltdown, many of the rail and mineral monopolies that have been feeding off of Polish land have found themselves bankrupt. With Germany in complete dissaray, now would seem like our best opportunity to seize their holdings and throw off Germany's economic stranglehold on Poland!"
poland.232.a:0 "Seize their assets!"

poland.233.t:0 "Polish Monopolies Crash"
poland.233.d:0 "In the wake of Black Monday, some of our corporate interests in Poland have gone bankrupt. We have now received news that the Polish government, ever irritated at our economic interest in their country, have moved to seize our corporate assets in their country, effectively removing our control over their economy. This is a disaster!"
poland.233.a:0 "We won't forget this!"

poland.234.t:0 "Ukraine declares Isolation Policy"
poland.234.d:0 "Ukraine has decided to embark on a path of isolation, leaving us dangerously exposed to German aggression. Should we turn towards the Internationale for protection?"
poland.234.a:0 "Start talks with France."
poland.234.b:0 "Better not provoke the Germans for now."

poland.235.t:0 "Germany Abandons Poland"
poland.235.d:0 "In the wake of the Black Monday Crisis that has crippled the German Nation, the German protectorate of Poland has managed to slip away. This to many was a long time coming, as German influence in the state had been waning for some time, however the recent events were the final straw. [POL.GetLeader] officially declared full independence from Germany earlier today, something that has largely gone unnoticed abroad. However, Germany has decided not to take action, seeing to focus on German Domestic issues over Poland.  "
poland.235.a:0 "It was not worth it."

poland.236.t:0 "What Doesn’t Kill Us..."
poland.236.d:0 "During the German attack on the City of Warsaw, the Kaiser’s forces utilized any and all underhanded tactics they could in order to gain the upper hand against our dug-in patriots and defenders. Using high-tech weaponry and state-of-the-art tactics, the Germans caused heavy damage to both life and the city around them. \n\nOne such act of needless violence was when a German radioman guided a Goliath tracked mine towards the Deanery of St. John’s Cathedral, detonating upon reaching the church walls causing widespread devastation. As the smoke cleared and we took back the city, it was revealed that only portions of the first and ground floors survived the blast, but so too did a single link of track from the tracked mine. Seeking to stick it to our would-be conquerors, the Deanery of St. John’s Cathedral has been repaired to nearly exactly how it was before the Battle for Warsaw. However, one change has been made. \n\nBuilt into the wall on the building’s north face where the Goliath detonated, the surviving piece of the tracked mine’s track was added to the structure of the church, complete with a small plaque commemorating the event. The whole process has come to embody the famous resilience of the Polish people, and the Church has become one of the most widely beloved and revered places in all of Warsaw. It is small showings of strength like this happening all across the nation that is responsible for our continued survival, and it is relics like this that we must defend in order to preserve what makes us truly Polish."
poland.236.a:0 "...Only makes us stronger."

In a twist of fate unforseen by anyone, not even himself, the strange man who wanted to be the King of Poland finally got his wish.

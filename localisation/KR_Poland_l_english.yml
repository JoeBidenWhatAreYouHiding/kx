### Leaders ###
POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_DESC:0 "Poland was reestablished by the Central Powers in formerly Russian lands after over a century of foreign rule. Competition between Austria and Germany for influence in Poland, both during and since the Weltkrieg, has left the regency council unable to perform its principle duty, the selection of a new monarch. The, so called, 'eternal regency' lords indecisively over a Poland which remains much the same as it was before the Weltkrieg - poor and restless."
POLITICS_ROMAN_DWOWSKI_DESC:0 "Roman Dmowski was a thorn in the side of Germany throughout the Weltkrieg. While many Polish nationalists embraced the Germans as liberators, Dmowski, wary of Germany's assimilation of Poles in its east, favoured the Entente. His Polish National Committee was recognized by the Entente as the legitimate government of Poland during the Weltkrieg. With German victory, Dmowkski was forced to agitate tactfully and in secret; now as head of state, Dmowski is poised to seek renewed Polish national glory."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_SIKORSKI_DESC:0 "Władysław Sikorski led legions of Polish volunteers against the Russian during the Weltkrieg; he proved a capable leader, but with the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Sikorski found himself and Poland betrayed by the very nations that labelled themselves its liberators. Following the war, Sikorski cemented his control of the newly established Polish military, and planned for a day when he could lead Poland into true independence. Now, it seems, that day has come; Sikorski has assumed control of the apparatus of the Polish state, and declared an end to foreign dominance."
POLITICS_POL_SEJM_DESC:0 "The Sejm is the lower house of the parliament of Poland. Historically, the Sejm was an assembly of clergy and nobility which, uniquely, elected the king of Poland. With no current head of state, the Sejm acts collectively as Poland's executive."
POLITICS_FELIKIS_DZIERZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_FRYDERYK_KRYSTIAN_SASKI_DESC:0 "Fryderyk Krystian Saski, born Friedrich Christian von Wettin, king of Saxony, has ascended to the Polish throne. Fryderyk Krystian's status as both king of a constituent state of the German Empire and Poland is alarming to many Poles, who think him subservient to the Kaiser. Subservient or not, Fryderyk Krystian's coronation does indicate increased German influence in Poland."
POLITICS_KAROL_OLBRACHT_HABSBURG_DESC:0 "Karol Olbracht von Habsburg-Lothringen, Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate for the Polish. When Emperor Karl plotted to annex Polish lands to Austria, Karol Olbracht advocated fiercely against it. Though amicable to his native Austria, as king of Poland, Karol continues to fight for the Polish people."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Mindaugas has now also been crowned king of Poland, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_AUGUSTYN_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, though not a descendant of any historical Polish monarch, has been enthroned as its new king. The Czartoryski family, ethnically Polish, were influential both in the days of the old Commonwealth and following Russian annexation. With Augustyn, the new Polish nation at last has a truly Polish king."
POLITICS_THE_TSAR_OF_ALL_RUSSIANS_DESC:0 "Poland, just as in the past, is under the control of Russia. Though careful to maintain the facade of independence, Poland is in effect a Russian puppet."
POLITICS_EUSTACHY_SAPIEHA_DESC:0 "Eustachy Sapieha has emerged victorious in Poland's latest elections. Sapieha is a monarchist; though, he has clarified that the monarchy shall only be restored with the consent of Poland's people. Sapieha himself rules much like a monarch; he is paternalistic and supportive of the aristocracy."
POLITICS_MIECZYSLAW_MICHALOWICZ_DESC:0 "Mieczysław Michałowicz, once a socialist, became disillusioned with leftism by the Bolshevik revolution. Michałowicz now champions individual liberty and the free exchange of goods typical of western liberals. Michałowicz has vowed, as president, to preserve Poland's democracy and the freedom of its people."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_WOJCIECHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Stanisław Wojciechowski, a political ally of Alexander Kerenskiy during the early days of the Russian Provisional Government, has achieved electoral victory in Poland. Wojciechowski, a self-described socialist, shuns the revolutionary ideas of the Communards and other syndicalist movements, and instead advocates liberal democracy with consideration and concern for all."
POLITICS_JAKUB_HANECKI_DESC:0 "Jakub Hanecki was the chief financial minister of the Bolsheviks from Lenin's return to Russia until the bitter defeat of the revolution. He fled the collapsing Soviet Russia under the cover of darkness, bringing with him troves of financial documentation and ledgers linking various foreign socialists to the revolution, and thus saving many from imprisonment or worse. Hanecki, with the death of Dzierzynski, has triumphed over his political rivals. He intends to inject much needed fiscal responsibility into the new socialist Polish government."
POLITICS_ROZA_LUKSEMBURG_DESC:0 "Róża Luksemburg's reputation precedes her; she is considered by many to the ideological progenitor of an entirely new strain of Marxism. Luksemburg, a Leninist, criticized the lack of internal democracy within the old Bolshevik party. She also advocates the necessity of a world socialist revolution; such is the only way, she argues, to secure the revolution at all."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_2_DESC:0 "With the death of the king, Poland is again ruled by a regency council. Wary of a return to the turmoil of the 'eternal regency', Poles anxiously await the coronation of a new monarch."
POLITICS_LUDWIK_PIOTR_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Ludwik Piotr Czartoryski, despite being a child, has directly succeeded his father as king of Poland. A comical image of the young king teething on the ancient crown, which was placed over his too-small head, has not helped assuage concerns that he is as of yet incapable of ruling."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_PLC_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Mindaugas has also been crowned king of Poland, and now a renewed union of his two kingdoms, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_FELIKS_DZIERZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland-Lithuania for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_ROKOSSOVSKY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 21st, 1896\nWarsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to a mixed Polish-Russian family, Konstanty Rokossowski hails from the noble Rokossowski family, even though his father, a railway officer, was as removed from traditional nobility as one could get. Rokossowski had a difficult childhood, he lost his father early in his life and he had to abandon school in order to make a living for the rest of his family. He caught up by reading books in Russian and Polish in his spare time, only to fuel his life long conflict on whether he was Russian, Polish, or something in between.\n\nIn 1914, alongside his cousin Franz, the 18-year old Konstanty signed up for the retreating Russian armies and became a cavalryman, serving with distinction and achieving the rank of non-commissioned officer. They had to part ways when the October Revolution broke out, however - Franz joined the Polish Military Organization and Konstanty was one of the first to volunteer for the Red Army. There, he quickly rose in rank as a capable cavalry commander, but could not turn the tide - the Soviet regime collapsed and fell, and Rokossowski was forced to flee. \n\nAfter years of soul-searching across Europe, he ended up in France, where he came into contact with the Polish socialists in exile and enrolled in the French army officer corps. Though he maintains contact with the other former Bolsheviks, Rokossowski has grown distant from the Russian revolutionary cause and thus did not follow them to Argentina - his eyes turn towards Poland instead. Perhaps there, in his other homeland, he can find a purpose."

POL_a_centralized_state_desc:0 "The monarch is the final authority on all matters of state, and the Szlachta only serve to undermine his authority.

It is unlikely to succeed, but there is no harm in trying..."
POL_poland_forever_desc:0 "Even if Poland is destroyed, even if the Polish state collapses into ruin, the Polish spirit will not be destroyed. Poland will live on forever in the hearts of the Polish people, and it will rise again, even if it takes another century of struggle."

POL_the_stab_in_the_back_desc:0 "Poland was promised many things during the Weltkrieg, and we were given almost nothing, reduced to a small shell of a nation, weak and ineffectual in our ambitions. We have been stabbed in the back by our so called "allies", and it is time for Poland to take what is hers."
POL_militarism_desc:0 "The people of Poland have been cheated out of what we were rightfully owed, and they know it. We must whip the people into a frenzy of nationalism, so that we may fill our ranks with proud soldiers to fuel the coming conflicts."

poland.124.d:0 "Initially established at the end of the Weltkrieg in order to ascertain the next King of Poland, the Regency Council has been in charge of Poland's political structure for almost two decades. Constant distractions, debates, and general inefficiencies have prevented the Council from doing anything of note for far too long, and have led Poland down a path of constant instability. Even now, debates continue in the Council over meaningless topics, and observers have little hope that any meaningful decision will be made in the next few years."
poland.124.a:0 "Unfortunate."

poland.125.t:0 "The Council is Distracted"
poland.125.d:0 "The most recent debate to enthrall the members of the Regency Council has to do with whether or not the future King of Poland needs to be at least as tall as the last King of Poland, so as to be more imposing in stature. True progress seems as far off as ever."

poland.131.t:0 "Poland Requests Dominion over Galicia"
poland.131.d:0 "Poland, firmly in our sphere of influence since the election of [POL.GetLeader], has made an official diplomatic request for dominion over Galicia. The Poles have a fairly weak claim to the whole region, however their claim to Cracow is strong, where the majority of the people are Poles and would likely welcome a return to Poland proper. How shall we respond?"
poland.131.a:0 "Utterly ridiculous!"

poland.135.t:0 "Poland Seeks Our Submission"
poland.135.d:0 "With the collapse of Germany and the Reichspakt alliance, we have found ourselves in a precarious position. We are few on allies and our future looks grim.

poland.138.t:0 "The Return of Cracow"
poland.138.d:0 "While not outright denying our claims to Galicia, Austria has instead proposed that we take dominion only over the Polish-majority region of Cracow, and leave the rest to the current administrators.

poland.141.t:0 "Lithuania Submits!"
poland.141.d:0 "In a desperate move, the Lithuanians have agreed to our proposal, submitting to our authority for their own benefit. This new relationship between our nations will surely benefit us both in the long term."
poland.141.a:0 "We shall care for them well."

poland.142.t:0 "Lithuania Defiant"
poland.142.d:0 "Lithuania has refused our offer of benevolent control, instead claiming that our offer is a grave insult to their ideals. Without our protection, they will surely be destroyed."
poland.142.a:0 "How could they?!"

poland.146.t:0 "Poland Seeks a Detente"
poland.146.d:0 "It appears the Polish question has solved itself. A telegram from Warsaw states that the Polish leader, [POL.GetLeader] seeks to join the Reichspakt and closer economic ties with Germany. It also appears they don't wish and/or demand any of their "lost" territory, though one would expect they may ask for such things in the future. With the Syndicalist in the west sharpening their knives and the bear in the east awaking from it's slumber, another arrow in the quiver is never a bad thing.."

poland.146.b:0 "Unless that arrow is Polish of course, let them rot for."

poland.147.t:0 "Treaty of Posen"
poland.147.d:0 "After much pomp and fanfare, the German and Polish representatives have signed the now dubbed "Treaty of Posen", officially allowing Poland to enter the Reichspakt. Though why Posen was chosen for this event appears to be a power move by the Kaiser himself, wishing to test Polish resolve. Many think it's a sign of the Kaiser's failing mental health, with him thinking Syndicalist's spies are after him. Either way, Poland is now a member of the Reichspakt and will serve for the greater good of it's community."
poland.147.a:0 "Wonderful!"

poland.148.t:0 "Poland Remains Alone"
poland.148.d:0 "It appears that the Germans, forever paranoid and delusional have rejected our attempts to join the Reichspakt. Only offering minor platitudes of friendship, it appears the rejection of the German candidate for the now defunct Polish throne is still being held by the German Aristocracy and their wicked Kaiser. Poland will have to step out into the wilderness alone, but it is not as if we haven't done this before"
poland.148.a:0 "Poland is not lost."

poland.149.t:0 "Poland Seeks an Alliance"

poland.151.d:0 "Seeking a diplomatic solution to our diplomatic isolation, we attempted to join the Russian Alliance in order to protect ourselves from outside threats.

poland.165.d:0 "Until the end of the Weltkrieg, there was no Poland. What had been Polish territory had been carved up between Austria, Russia and Prussia at the end of the 18th century, and in the face of scattered uprisings throughout the 19th those three nations continued to hold on to their Polish territory. Polish fortunes turned in 1916, though, with the Act of November 5th, where it was granted autonomy from the collapsing Russia. However, this triumph came with a bitter taste, as the election of a Polish king was postponed again and again between 1921 and 1936 as Austria-Hungary and Germany squabbled about the nationality of a possible king and the exact status of a Polish kingdom. Hence, the regency of Janusz Radziwill continues. However, all hope of a Polish kingdom is not over: the Ausgleich of 1937 is eagerly looked forward to in Warsaw as the time when the future of Poland is decided. However, certain forces in Warsaw are tired of being under the Austro-German yoke, and looks towards their 'enslaved' brothers in Germany, Austria and the eastern states, hoping to one day create a kingdom for all Poles."

poland.196.d:0 "With the unruly monarchist factions now destroyed for the time being, and the military's control over the country all but absolute, many in the High Command are wondering if the Marshal should do away with the farce of the 'Kingdom of Poland' once and for all."
poland.196.a:0 "The Kingdom is merely a fiction."
poland.196.b:0 "We cannot violate the sanctity of the Kingdom."

poland.197.t:0 "The Monarchist Faction"
poland.197.d:0 "Troubled by the increasing control the Marshal is having over state affairs in Poland, a large group of Szlachta and State Officials who continue to support the monarchy have come forward with an offer. If we guarantee their roles in [POL.GetLeader]'s government and take an oath that the monarchy will be restored in due time, they will give their full support to the current government of Poland. It is a promising offer, but how much can we really trust these men?"
poland.197.a:0 "We will make the deal."
poland.197.b:0 "They have no real power, begone!"

poland.205.t:0 "Monarchist Coup"
poland.205.d:0 "Late last evening, gunfire erupted from many different government offices around Warsaw. In the chaos, a statement was broadcast from within the centre of the city, declaring the restoration of the Kingdom of Poland, and the downfall of the current regime. There has been a deafening silence in opposition to this message, indicating a complete victory for the monarchist faction. [POL.GetLeader] has not been seen nor heard from since the coup began, and the monarchists have already placed Augustyn Czartoryski on the throne, cementing their victory over the opposition."
poland.205.a:0 "We should have known..."

poland.208.t:0 "Licensing a Panzer Design"
poland.208.d:0 "The '9-tonne Polish' programme has reached a point where a design must be settled on if production is to begin. There are many different nation's armour designs we may attempt to licence as a base for our design, but we may only choose one of them.\n\nWhich design should we attempt to licence?"
poland.208.a:0 "Let us choose the Commune's H35."
poland.208.b:0 "Let us choose the German Kätzchen."
poland.208.c:0 "Let us choose the Austrian Panzer L.20 Pfau."
poland.208.e:0 "Let us choose the Canadian Vickers LT III."
poland.208.f:0 "Let us choose the Russian T-25."
poland.208.h:0 "Let us create our own design, instead."

poland.209.t:0 "Signing the Pacta Conventa"
poland.209.d:0 "A long-standing tradition of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Pacta Conventa was a contractual agreement between the people of Poland and the newly elected king. These pacts were continuously signed by elected kings from 1573 to 1764 as a sign of good faith on the part of the monarch. This pact affirmed the king's pledges to the nation, and was written uniquely for each king to sign upon election to the Polish throne.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture of King [POL.GetLeader]'s ascension to the throne, the Sejm has written a new Pacta Conventa for the king to sign. A king has not ruled the Polish people for almost 150 years, and many have come to see the king's signing of this document as the de facto beginning of Poland's new age in the modern world."
poland.209.a:0 "With this signature, a new age begins."

poland.210.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Poland"
poland.210.d:0 "The effects of Black Monday are spreading throughout the economic world, and Poland is not immune to this disaster. Although economically isolated from most of Europe due to her political situation, Poland's economy still relies heavily on German trading.\n\nNews of this economic disaster has caused a run on banks across the nation, and people are already demanding that the impotent government take action. We can only hope to survive the coming storm."
poland.210.a:0 "Let us hope our economy survives."

poland.211.t:0 "The Fate of the Royal Castle"
poland.211.d:0 "Constructed in 1598 as the seat of power for Sigismund III, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has stood as the seat of Polish Kings for hundreds of years. But now, as the country has thrown off the shackles of Monarchist oppression, the Castle sits as a blight upon the worker's paradise that is Warsaw.\n\nMany proposals have been put forth on how to deal with this eyesore, but only one can be chosen."
poland.211.a:0 "Redesign it to serve the Syndicalist government."
poland.211.b:0 "Renovate it as a museum to workers worldwide."
poland.211.c:0 "Tear it down, and put a park in its place."

poland.212.t:0 "Monarchist Train Bombing"
poland.212.d:0 "Late last night a train arriving in Lublin was rocked by a large explosion which destroyed the railway and several train cars. While no civilians were hurt in the explosion, anti-government slogans were found painted on the side of the train, alongside messages praising the old Kingdom.\n\nLocal newspapers have already begun running stories on the "Monarchist Menace". It seems that the Monarchist faction is growing more bold in their actions."
poland.212.a:0 "We must deal with these Monarchists."

poland.213.t:0 "Monarchist Assassination"
poland.213.d:0 "Today on his way home from a long political meeting, the local governor in Lodz was killed by a small bomb being thrown at his vehicle. The bomb killed both the governor and his driver, and caused panic throughout the city. The assailant was heard shouting pro-Monarchist slogans as he disappeared into the crowds. Local police have been unable to identify the attacker, despite a hours-long search."
poland.213.a:0 "Damn!"

poland.214.t:0 "The Monarchist Militia"
poland.214.d:0 "Rumours have been spreading of a "Monarchist Militia" being formed in the Polish countryside in opposition to the government. While no real actions have been taken against the government as of yet, the fact that this "Militia" can be neither found nor dealt with is beginning to wear on the people's faith in the state."
poland.214.a:0 "The Monarchists must be stopped!"

poland.215.t:0 "20th Anniversary of Polish Independence"
poland.215.d:0 "There is celebration around the nation today as citizens of the [POL.GetName] celebrate 20 years of independence. The Kingdom of Poland was officially created with the signing of the Act of November 5th, which forged the new Polish state from the ashes of a failing Russia."
poland.215.a:0 "Here's to twenty more years!"

poland.219.t:0 "[POL.GetLeader]'s Inaugural Address"
poland.219.d:0 "As the first president of the new Polish Republic, [POL.GetLeader] gave a rousing inaugural speech today outside of Belvedere Palace, the building selected as the seat of the new presidency. In his speech, [POL.GetLeader] promised to unite all the Polish people together in these uncertain times, and made wide promises of reform and a movement away from the old days of the Regency Council. The speech was met with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, who came waving Polish flags and banners of the new Republic."
poland.219.a:0 "A moving speech."

poland.220.t:0 "Raising Modlin Fortress"
poland.220.d:0 "With the recent increase in tensions, our military is reviewing old fortresses for renewed service. One of the contenders is Modlin fortress, a massive fortification on the confluence of the Narew and the Vistula near Warsaw. Constructed by Napoleon in 1806 as a key fortification in his campaign against Russia, and later used by the Russians themselves, the fortress nevertheless still commands an important strategic position in the region.\n\nShould we renovate the fortress?"
poland.220.a:0 "Raise the fortress."
poland.220.b:0 "Our efforts are better spent elsewhere."

poland.221.t:0 "Poland Joins the Vienna Circle"
poland.221.d:0 "Responding to our expansion of the Vienna Circle, our dynastic relatives in Poland have made apparent their desire to join, and have sent their own representatives to Vienna to participate."
poland.221.a:0 "They are most welcome."
poland.222.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Raszyn"
poland.222.d:0 "Earlier today the first broadcasts could be heard throughout the nation from the newest radio station operated by Polskie Radio S.A. in Raszyn. This radio station, the strongest in Europe, had a power of 120 kilowatts and could be heard from hundreds of kilometers away. This long-range station will allow all Polish citizens nationwide to hear the news and other important information from the comfort of their own homes."
poland.222.a:0 "A fantastic achievement."

poland.223.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Warsaw II"
poland.223.d:0 "Continuing the expansion of their national radio network, Polskie Radio S.A. has today begun broadcasting from their second permanent radio station in Warsaw, bringing their total number of stations to five. These stations and their coverage of Poland proper ensure that Polish radio broadcasts reach Polish people all across Europe, even crossing national boundaries."
poland.223.a:0 "The Polish voice knows no bounds."

poland.225.t:0 "Deposition of the King's Brother"
poland.225.d:0 "Rising on a swelling tide of populist action, the "Red Hetman", as he is being called by the unwashed masses, Nikita Khrushchev, has moved to depose the current ruler of Ukraine, Vasyl I. Normally events in Ukraine would not concern the Polish crown, however, Vasily I was the brother of the current king of Poland, Karol Olbracht. Obviously such an aggressive action against the king's own brother is an outrage, and one we must deal with immediately."
poland.225.a:0 "We will not forget this."
poland.225.b:0 "This is an outrage! War!"

poland.226.t:0 "War with Germany!"
poland.226.d:0 "The time has come, for one of our greatest foes has come bearing down upon us once more. Germany, ever an enemy of the Polish people, now stands fimrly opposite us on the battlefield, ready to take all we hold dear. It is time for the greatest fight of our generation, where we decide the fate of Poland for generations to come."
poland.226.a:0 "We will fight to the bitter end."

poland.227.t:0 "Poland's Syndicalist Revolution"
poland.227.d:0 "The Kingdom of Poland, a small rump state born from the wreckage of the Weltkrieg in the middle of Europe, has had its government collapse in the wake of a Syndicalist revolution. We have strong economic and political interests in keeping the Poles within our sphere of influence, and this revolution transforms them from a weak backwater into a potential threat.\n\nLessons from the Weltkrieg have taught us the dangers of a two-front war. We cannot allow the Poles to consolidate their nation and potentially align themselves with the French Commune."
poland.227.a:0 "Draft a list of demands. This cannot stand."
poland.227.b:0 "We are busy elsewhere."

poland.228.t:0 "Germany Sends Demands"
poland.228.d:0 "German observers in Poland, previously sidelined by the near-total collapse of the old regime, today quietly delivered a missive to the office of the new Syndicalist head of state, comrade [POL.GetLeader].\n\nThe note came from the German foreign office, and its message was as vindictive as it was clear. The new Polish government was in no way recognized by the German Empire, as is seen as a rebel force fighting in defiance of the true government of the Kingdom of Poland. The current 'rebels' were to submit to a list of no less than 16 demands, and to retreat from their offices in Warsaw, to be replaced by 'proper authorities' under German supervision.\n\nIt is clear that this list of demands was never meant to be accepted, and is nothing but a pretext for an imperialist German war."
poland.228.a:0 "This is outrageous, the Kaiser has no power here!"
poland.228.b:0 "We are surrounded by German puppets, to fight is to die."

poland.229.t:0 "Poland Refuses to Surrender"
poland.229.d:0 "We have received a response to our list of perfectly reasonable demands, sent to the head of the Syndicalist rebels currently occupying Warsaw. The communication sent back to Berlin was so offensive and full of foul language that it was said to be more curse than communique.\n\nHowever crudely worded, the message was clear. The Syndicalists will not submit to proper German authority, and we have acquired a reasonable casus belli to remove them from our borders."
poland.229.a:0 "Crush them."

poland.230.t:0 "Poland Agrees to Cooperation"
poland.230.d:0 "We have received a response to our list of perfectly reasonable demands, sent to the head of the Syndicalist rebels currently occupying Warsaw. Initially, no response seemed forthcoming from the Syndicalist government operating out of the Polish capital.\n\nHowever, this morning a message was received that outlined Poland's willingness to cooperate on all German demands and to restore the position of the monarch as head of the nation. Initially, the message was believed to be a hoax or some elaborate joke. However, it was quickly determined that the message was in fact genuine.\n\nIt appears that the threat of German intervention has scared the Syndicalists into submission. The Polish monarchy is to be restored as soon as possible, under German supervision."
poland.230.a:0 "They have seen the light."

poland.231.t:0 "Restoration of the Monarchy"
poland.231.d:0 "Today the Polish monarchy saw its restoration under the eyes of a strict German military presence. All remnants of the short-lived Syndicalist regime have been removed from the public eye, and most Syndicalist leaders of note have fled into hiding.\n\nFor his part, the new Polish king, the German Friedrich Christian von Wettin, promised to uphold the will of the Polish people, and promised an era of healing and reconciliation between the Polish and German peoples. Poland has entered a new era in its history."
poland.231.a:0 "We have been humiliated, but the regency is over."

poland.232.t:0 "German Monopolies Crash"
poland.232.d:0 "In the wake of Germany's quick economic meltdown, many of the rail and mineral monopolies that have been feeding off of Polish land have found themselves bankrupt. With Germany in complete dissaray, now would seem like our best opportunity to seize their holdings and throw off Germany's economic stranglehold on Poland!"
poland.232.a:0 "Seize their assets!"

poland.233.t:0 "Polish Monopolies Crash"
poland.233.d:0 "In the wake of Black Monday, some of our corporate interests in Poland have gone bankrupt. We have now received news that the Polish government, ever irritated at our economic interest in their country, have moved to seize our corporate assets in their country, effectively removing our control over their economy. This is a disaster!"
poland.233.a:0 "We won't forget this!"

poland.234.t:0 "Ukraine declares Isolation Policy"
poland.234.d:0 "Ukraine has decided to embark on a path of isolation, leaving us dangerously exposed to German aggression. Should we turn towards the Internationale for protection?"
poland.234.a:0 "Start talks with France."
poland.234.b:0 "Better not provoke the Germans for now."

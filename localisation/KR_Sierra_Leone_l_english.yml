sierra.1.t:0 "A Crack Threatens to Grow Within the UNF"
sierra.1.d:0 "Until now, the big tent that is the United National Front has been able to maintain stability and order by safeguarding the moderate centre of Sierra Leonean politics, but as the nation further stabilizes, many chafe under the alleged inaction of President Milton Margai. These forces within the UNF’s big tent - primarily the Protectorate Educative Progressive Union of Amadu Wurie on the right and Lamina Sankoh’s branch of the Sierra Leone People’s Party on the left - now jockey for control of the government from within the UNF, threatening to tear Margai’s united front apart in order to pursue their own agenda. Milton Margai, one of the key forefathers of the Sierra Leonean independence movement, is known for his moderate stances, his charm and friendly demeanor, and his political savvy, being well respected by most in the nation regardless of class or social standing, but he has also been accused of causing stagnation by some due to his hesitance to implement any kind of sweeping reforms, instead preferring compromise, bipartisanship, and gradualism, while others are wary of his power-hungry younger brother Albert Margai who has shown an interest in more authoritarian practices, though thankfully he has little real power in the UNF.\n\nFurthermore, on the Left of the UNF divide, there is Lamina Sankoh - born as Etheldred Nathaniel Jones - who is a creole and former Christian priest educated in America and Britain known for his more liberal, populist takes and pro-working class stances, overseeing programs like penny-savings banks for the poor as well as successfully organizing the total restructuring of Freetown’s municipal government to make it more efficient, though his detractors see him and his People’s Party as dangerous rabble rousers and foreign-influenced radicals despite Sankoh’s own anti-Western stances and committal to conservative Sierra Leonean ideals of democracy, though more level-headed opponents of his instead attack his unbalanced focus on our urban areas. Alternatively, on the Right of the UNF divide is Amadu Wurie and his Protectorate Educative Progressive Union. A teacher by trade and the son of the paramount chief of the Fula people, Wurie is focused on education reform and combating the illiteracy epidemic while also developing the nation’s interior and rural expanses, additionally setting himself up as a bastion of Sierra Leonean tradition and culture resisting modernist degradation, though he has been accused of openly favoring the Muslim church too much despite his alleged secularist stances. As Sankoh’s liberals and Wurie’s conservatives bicker and compete for a shot at power, the wider nation is unsure if Margai and his United National Front will be able to weather the storm."

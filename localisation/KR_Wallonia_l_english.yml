### REX ###

POLITICS_LEON_DEGRELLE_DESC:0 "Young, dynamic, charismatic and endowed with the talent to exalt the crowds, Léon Joseph Marie Ignace Degrelle has all the qualities required for leadership.\n\nSon of a middle-class Catholic brewer, Léon Degrelle spent his youth reading numerous literary texts, even writing his own poems from the age of 15 onwards and expressing his marked charisma as early as secondary school, where he discovered the thought of Charle Maurras whom he admired and of whom he became a fervent supporter, promoting a cult of the monarchy and anti-parliamentarianism. Following the establishment of Flanders-Wallonia, Degrelle was elected deputy of the Catholic Party, in spite of the suppression of the Walloon populations of which Degrelle was a part, he always kept in his heart the concept of Belgium that Germany was trying to erase but recognized that guerrilla warfare was not as effective as what he called 'the legal resistance'.\n\nHe was, however, kicked out of the collaborationist Catholic Party for his overtly anti-Flanders-Walloon views, in addition to his much more radical views than the average party member. He then founded his own newspaper, where he collaborated with the famous cartoonist Hergé, and his political movement, the Rex Popular Front, more commonly known as Rex. Taking many different inspirations, from French Maurrasism to German Volkisch currents, he made his own version of Belgian nationalism, combining corporatism, anti-parliamentarianism, historical anti-Semitism, state catholicism and populist agrarian socio-economic policies. After the fall of Flanders-Wallonia, the young Degrelle finally took control of Wallonia and now intends to lead the Belgian national renaissance to a successful conclusion."

### Events ###

wll.1.t:0 "The Dissolution of Flanders-Wallonia"
wll.1.d:0 "Flanders has seceded from our Kingdom and has declared its independence. German citizens and the Royal Family have fled the region and are re-establishing their hold on our nation. Meanwhile the Revolution still rages on and is destabilising the region with no clear end in sight. Quick and decisive action will be required to avoid the Red Menace that wants to destroy our nation. Walloon capitalists and liberals look on however, fearing the revolution but equally unhappy with German rule. Their efforts to form a republic have proven fruitless over the last decade but a new opportunity may well have now presented itself."
wll.1.a:0 "Hoist the Coq, Wallonia is born."

wll.2.t:0 "Trouble at Seraing"
wll.2.d:0 "With riots and protests throughout the entire Sillon Industriel, members of the Syndicalist resistance have holed up in the Seraing Steel Mills refusing to allow the factory to reopen and holding twelve members of the administration hostage. Troops retreating from Flanders are massing near Namur but a small contingent could be relocated to Liège to help quell the issue. Shareholders of the company meanwhile are desperately urging the government to leave the facility intact and are lobbying as much as possible to preserve their interests."
wll.2.a:0 "Send an armed force to Seraing."
wll.2.b:0 "Listen to the reds' demands."

wll.3.t:0 "Negotiations With the Syndicalists"
wll.3.d:0 "One of the leaders of the rebels trapped inside the mills has come out and given us their demands. They promise to leave the factory intact if the King adheres to the terms won during the 1935 strikes, signs a new Labour Act enacting the promised forty-hour working week and sets out measures providing more transparent employee-employer relations. The Liberal party has already declared their opposition to the demands as it would suppress free trade and strip privileges from them. Still, if we were to cave in to their demands we might be able to weaken support for an outright syndicalist revolution and change the mind of the more liberal POB members."
wll.3.a:0 "Give in to their demands."
wll.3.b:0 "Stall the negotiations."
wll.3.c:0 "Send in the Feldgendarmerie."

#Stalled Negotiations

wll.31.t:0 "Stalled Negotiations"
wll.31.d:0 "Two days have passed since the syndicalists' demands were received and no answer has been given as of yet by the government. News of the situation has spread like wildfire throughout the nation and similar actions have been undertaken in the glass factories of Charleroi and have even struck the arms producer FN. The situation is reaching a boiling point and with terrorist attacks in Hainaut, we need to act now or the army will be spread too thin to counter large uprisings. Our commanders are advising us to make an example of the Seraing strikers and to send in the army to flush them from their stronghold. Liberal lobbyists are still warning the King not to act violently and advise him to seek a middle ground."
wll.31.a:0 "Send in the Feldgendarmerie."
wll.31.b:0 "Sign a reduced version of the Labour Act."

wll.32.t:0 "Labour Act Adopted"
wll.32.d:0 "With the promise of better working conditions and the announced Labour Act, many of the smaller strikes have been calmed and left the factories without causing too much damage. The Strikers of Seraing however are still holding out and are once more demanding the government sign the full Labour Act or to resign at once. The POB, which has seen its influence greatly increase in the last decade, has joined the syndicalists' call and have demanded the immediate resignation of the government."
wll.32.a:0 "We must gain support from the liberals!"

wll.33.t:0 "Liberal Party Refuses to Assist"
wll.33.d:0 "Smelling their chance, the Liberals have decided to throw their own hat into the ring and have joined the POB in their demands for resignation. They state that the only way to solve this crisis now is by listening to the people and holding emergency elections."
wll.33.a:0 "Where do we get our support from now?"

wll.34.t:0 "Protest in La Louvière"
wll.34.d:0 "It appears that in La Louvière thousands of disgruntled miners have come down to the town square to protest against the pro-German government and to demand Adalbert's abdication. Feldgendarmerie have been keeping watch on the protest and so far have been able to discourage violence between the Walloons and the much smaller counterprotest by German citizens. Though only small in size, the protest marks the end of an era. Further protests around the nation are already being organised and a general strike has now kept the nation paralysed for two weeks. The situation is becoming completely untenable with many Germans leaving the nation to avoid repression by the syndicalists."
wll.34.a:0 "The monarchy is faltering!"

wll.35.t:0 "The Namur March"
wll.35.d:0 "Further protests are engulfing the nation, with many people leaving their homes to gather on the streets of Namur. A product of the prestigious regional glass industry, a life-sized sculpture of Adalbert has been toppled in the town square and symbolically smashed to bits with mining pickaxes. Though police were able to arrest the perpetrators it was already too late as shards of glass were quickly grabbed by bystanders permanently memorialising the events of the day."
wll.35.a:0 "We must fortify the Palace."

wll.36.t:0 "Royal Councillor Resigns"
wll.36.d:0 "Not willing to risk his life for that of his king anymore, the royal councillor has announced his resignation and was seen leaving the palace to loud applause. The Feldgendarmerie have been used to push the crowd away from the fences and avoid violent escalation. Their efforts have been met by a grand crowd-driven performance of the Chant Des Wallons"
wll.36.a:0 "Summon Parliament to the Palace."

wll.37.t:0 "Final Royal Meeting"
wll.37.d:0 "Only a small faction of politicians with nearly no members of the POB has answered the call and have come to attend what may be the last Royal Meeting. The King asked every single person in the room whether they believe his current predicament is solvable. He was met with no clear response until the leader of the Liberal Party, Auguste Buisseret, stepped forward and told the King that there was no way he would be able to return to power. The people have spoken and it's abdication they demand. Only then will we be able to calm down the populace and resume our work."
wll.37.a:0 "Abdication is the only dignified way out."
wll.37.b:0 "But what about a referendum?"

wll.38.t:0 "Referendum Refused"
wll.38.d:0 "In a last ditch effort to retain power Adalbert requested the government hold a referendum on the future of the monarchy but was turned down. Support for the King has almost reached single digits, making a costly referendum pointless. The proposal was put to a vote and unanimously voted down. The reign of King Adalbert is over."
wll.38.a:0 "Sign the abdication papers."

wll.39.t:0 "King Adalbert I Abdicates"
wll.39.d:0 "Turned down by both the Flemish and the Walloons, Adalbert has finally given in and at 4pm put down his final signature as King of the Flemish and Walloons. Although German rule is far from over, the monarchy has reached its end."
wll.39.a:0 "Hoist the Cok Wallon!"

wll.310.t:0 "First Walloon Elections"
wll.310.d:0 "After two decades of strict German rule, the first free elections have been held. Even the syndicalist branch of the POB has been allowed to participate and has spend the last week desperately amassing as much popularity as possible. The PL has also gathered substantial support and is particularly popular around the city of Namur and among the remaining German minority. However no party seems capable of achieving an absolute majority and a political impasse may drag on for multiple weeks if no agreement is reached."
wll.310.a:0 "The POB wins the election."
wll.310.b:0 "The PL wins a close victory."

wll.311.t:0 "PL Wins the Most Seats"
wll.311.d:0 "Closely beating the POB and the Catholics, the PL under its leader Auguste Buisseret has won the most seats and been given the right to begin forming a government. While a Catholic-Liberal alliance is the most likely outcome, the POB has offered to assist the PL if they can guarantee more freedom for the worker class and immediately pass the Labour Act through Parliament. A so-called 'Red-Yellow alliance' would grant almost complete control over the government but may be more difficult to keep intact than a Swedish coalition."
wll.311.a:0 "The real work starts now."

#Give in to their demands

wll.41.t:0 "Adalbert Caves in to the Strikers"
wll.41.d:0 "With his back against the wall and his position as strong sovereign growing increasingly fragile, King Adalbert has agreed to sign the Labour Act. The syndicalists left their position and their leader could be seen shaking hands with the King, publicly indicating a curious softening of Adalbert's absolutist obsession."
wll.41.a:0 "The Labour Act is signed."

wll.42.t:0 "Support for the King Increases"
wll.42.d:0 "Impressed by the decisive actions of their King, Parliament gave a standing ovation on their next sitting. The leader of the POB, Fernand Dehousse, gave a speech openly praising Adalbert and announcing his push for a more democratic constitutional monarchy."
wll.42.a:0 "Public adulation, interesting..."

wll.43.t:0 "Truce Offered to the Resistance"
wll.43.d:0 "With the Liège province partially pacified, Adalbert has offered a truce to the syndicalist resistance which still fiercly defends the western villages of Hainaut. Promising a royal pardon and the option for them to create their own legal party, the King has demanded a complete end to hostilities. The syndicalist rebels however have refused this offer and increased their raids on our military camps."
wll.43.a:0 "They have had their chance."

wll.44.t:0 "Syndicalist Resistance Crushed"
wll.44.d:0 "After the syndicalist refusal, a strike force consisting of both Walloon and German troops was assembled with orders to push into Mons and secure the city while the detachments flanked the rebels, enveloped them and began successfully clearing the villages street by street. Though two weeks of heavy fighting ensued, in the end we regained control with relatively minimal casualties."
wll.44.a:0 "The Syndicalists have been defeated for now."

#Send in the Feldgendarmerie

wll.51.t:0 "Troops Storm Seraing"
wll.51.d:0 "Just like last year Adalbert has yet again given the order to disperse any protesters violently and break up the strikes with force. Within two hours the factory complex was cleared of all opposition. The floor is red with blood as the last of the syndicalists are slaughtered, a clear warning to all others willing to protest."
wll.51.a:0 "The resistance will be quelled again."

wll.52.t:0 "Mons Liberated"
wll.52.d:0 "After our defeat at Mons during the Belgian revolution, our troops have been licking their wounds. Now they are however fully prepared and ready to attack the syndicalist barricades."
wll.52.a:0 "Fire at will, men."

wll.53.t:0 "POB Banned From Parliament"
wll.53.d:0 "Though no clear connection can be found between the moderate faction of the POB who has been part of the government since 1919 and the radical syndicalist splinter faction, Adalbert has signed a royal decree outlawing the party and kicking it out of the government. Although loud protests erupted as expected, all were quelled by the prospect of prison."
wll.53.a:0 "Another step towards the end of Syndicalism."

wll.54.t:0 "A New Wallonia"
wll.54.d:0 "Much has changed during the last two weeks, with the remaining syndicalist cells being destroyed and mass arrests throughout the Sillon Industriel. Experts estimate the death toll at about 15,300 citizens and the arrest of around 800 leading members of the organisation. German control has once again been largely established in Wallonia, kept intact by a regime of fear and repression."
wll.54.a:0 "I think a toast is in order."

wll.55.t:0 "Royal Councillor Appointed"
wll.55.d:0 "While the power of Parliament has been curbed they still retain some power. Therefore we still need our royal councillor to keep an eye on them. While [GetHeadOfGovernment] has served us well for many years, he seems to have a faltering resolve and may be in need of a replacement. Much of our power in Parliament is based around the Catholic Party which has proposed a candidate to succeed Reeder. The Liberals have also announced their favorite and are pressing Adalbert to make a choice."
wll.55.a:0 "Von Wilmowsky will remain councillor."
wll.55.b:0 "The Catholic candidate gets chosen."
wll.55.c:0 "The Liberal candidate gets chosen."

#Lobbying with Germany

wll.6.t:0 "Search For Assistance Against Flanders"
wll.6.d:0 "The political situation has stabilised and the economy is slowly recovering, yet much remains to be done. Flanders, which declared its independence during the Belgian Revolution, is still a rightful part of our country. However ti has fallen out of our sphere of influence and is now a direct member of the Reichspakt. Only by carefully manoeuvring our way on the German political battlefield can we secure their support for the reunification."
wll.6.a:0 "Send word to Germany."

wll.61.t:0 "Wallonia Requests Our Support"
wll.61.d:0 "After the chaos of the Belgian revolution, the nation of Flanders-Wallonia split into two separate states. The Dutch speaking region of Flanders has successfully achieved its seperation from the union and has become a somewhat autonomous member of the Reichspakt. Wallonia however is still under our more direct control and has finally defeated the revolution. Now they request our aid in reconquering their lost land and reuniting Flanders-Wallonia. While this may reestablish our rule over the region it may lead to further trouble in the future. Denial of their request may once again throw the nation into turmoil as the power of the government may be called into question."
wll.61.a:0 "Support the Walloon cause."
wll.61.b:0 "No, the Flemish are goood allies."

wll.62.t:0 "Germany Supports Us"
wll.62.d:0 "The Kaiser has seen the right way and has acceded to our request. No German aid will be sent to Flanders in case of war and no other members of the Reichspakt will be allowed to intervene."
wll.62.a:0 "Prepare the invasion."

wll.63.t:0 "Germany Denies Our Request"
wll.63.d:0 "The Kaiser has denied our request and expelled the emmisaries who came up with this supposedly ridiculous idea. If we attack Flanders, we can be sure to feel the full wrath of the German behemoth. Unrest is already brewing in Parliament with many seeing this as the first signs of weakness. We will have to tread carefully to counter nationalist uprisings."
wll.63.a:0 "Wilhelm has failed us!"

#The Government has Failed!

wll.7.t:0 "The Government is Failing!"
wll.7.d:0 "After the disastrous campaign to gather support against Flanders and the failure to completely solve the syndicalist problem, nationalists are flocking to the banner of Léon Degrelle who promises Wallonia for the Walloons and a strong answer to syndicalism. While the Liberals have already spoken against his outrageous populism, the Catholics seem to be unsure about whether to speak out against him. Trouble is also brewing in the army where many who joined up to defeat the Flemish are disappointed by their government and are requesting a stronger response."
wll.7.a:0 "Arrest Degrelle!"

wll.71.t:0 "Arrest of Degrelle"
wll.71.d:0 "Although Degrelle was easily captured by our police force, this has caused massive outrage across the cities. Many see this as curbing of freedom of speech and Rexist propaganda is starting to appear on every street corner with small skirmishes occurring between police and members when caught."
wll.71.a:0 "This situation is starting to escalate."

wll.72.t:0 "Trouble at the University of Liège"
wll.72.d:0 "The populist rhetoric of Degrelle has spread far and wide and has become a breeding ground for students having trouble finding work after the Black Monday crisis. Peaceful protests are being organised on campus and in the streets calling for his release and the creation of new jobs."
wll.72.a:0 "Disperse the crowds."

wll.73.t:0 "Mutiny in the Army"
wll.73.d:0 "In many of the smaller kazernes troups conscripted specifically for the unification wars, Walloon soldiers seem to be plotting against their German commanders. Disobeying orders and deliberately damaging military equipment seems to have become popular passtimes amongst our young soldiery."
wll.73.a:0 "Disperse these regiments across the nation."

wll.74.t:0 "Message From the Vatican"
wll.74.d:0 "The pope has decided to interfere in the Degrelle case calling for clemency. It appears that supporters of Rex were able to reach the nuntius of München, Eugenio Pacelli who contacted the pope. Impressed by Degrelles' devotion to God, the Holy Father has requested that our government grant Degrelle clemency. It would be in our best interests to keep this request secret as it may cause severe trouble if this leaks out. Cardinal Mercier has offered to speak on the prime minister's behalf in Parliament denying the whole affair."
wll.74.a:0 "Allow Mercier to go ahead."

wll.75.t:0 "Betrayed By Mercier!"
wll.75.d:0 "Although his speech was screened by the cabinet and given to him before the speech, Mercier decided to speak out against the government questioning their resolve and explaining the Papal affair in its entirety. This evidently led to outrage in Parliament with supporters of Degrelle demanding his release and praising Mercier for his efforts in whistleblowing about the scandal."
wll.75.a:0 "This is not going too well."

wll.76.t:0 "Release Degrelle?"
wll.76.d:0 "With popular opinion turning against the government and demand for Degrelle's release increasing by the day, we will soon be forced to decide whether to release him and hope that it calms down the crowds gathering in front of Parliament, or keep him imprisoned and risk the people's wrath. The minister for internal affairs however is pushing the prime minister to speed up the trial and have Degrelle executed before the situation gets out of hand."
wll.76.a:0 "Release Degrelle."
wll.76.b:0 "Move the trial forward."

#Degrelle released
wll.77.t:0 "Degrelle Released"
wll.77.d:0 "To avoid further escalation the government has decided not to press their case against Degrelle and dropped charges against him. Although this act served initially to stem the growing unrest, most of the damage has already been done. Pictures showing a frail and weakened Degrelle leaving the prison are front page news across the entire country. Rexists in the government are pushing for a motion of no confidence saying that the current government clearly doesn't speak for its people and should resign at once. Degrelle himself has in the meantime announced his candidature for prime minister and is helping to fuel the Rexist propaganda machine."
wll.77.a:0 "A catastrophe!"

wll.78.t:0 "The Motion of No Confidence Succeeds!"
wll.78.d:0 "Defeated in a motion of no confidence by 103 to 75, the entire cabinet has reluctantly resigned and the government has fallen. Early elections have been called for the end of the month while all regular government affairs have ceased. It has already become clear that this going to be a close election with REX appearing to be on the verge of becoming the largest party in Wallonia."
wll.78.a:0 "The POB, DC and PL band together."
wll.78.b:0 "The DC speaks out in favour of Degrelle."

wll.79.t:0 "Rex Wins the Election!"
wll.79.d:0 "Rex has become the largest party in Wallonia closely followed by the POB. Though Rex failed to reach an outright majority, with support from the DC a working coalition has been established. The POB and PL have called for a recount but have been turned down by the Courts, with the judges stating that REX has won fair and square."
wll.79.a:0 "Degrelle assumes control."

wll.710.t:0 "The Grand Coalition Wins the Election!"
wll.710.d:0 "By combining their efforts and denouncing REX, the grand coalition of POB, DC and PL was able to win the election. REX only achieved 19% of the votes and has been excluded from the government. Although many of Degrelle's supporters still remain, the party will most likely never achieve the same momentum."
wll.710.a:0 "A victory for democracy!"

wll.711.t:0 "The Trial of Degrelle"
wll.711.d:0 "Thousands have gathered outside Wallonia's highest court as Degrelle is brought before the judge. After many hours of proceedings the judge has finally given his trial verdict. Degrelle has been variously found guilty of committing an attack on the nation aimed at overthrowing or changing its form of government and bringing citizens under arms against the legal state and its lawfully appointed organs. This assortment of crimes is to be punished by the death penalty, an outcome to be fulfilled before the end of the week."
wll.711.a:0 "Hopefully this means an end to REX."

wll.712.t:0 "Rexist Coup"
wll.712.d:0 "Fueled by the unjust condemnation of Degrelle and the severity of his punishment, ever more supporters have flocked to the Rexist banner. On Sunday night, with most government agencies closed military putschists launched a pro-Rexist coup, lifting the prime minister from his bed and capturing many key military installations. Freed by his supporters Degrelle has declared the begining of a new Rexist era and personally accompanied his troops to capture the last remaining government strongholds. When the sun rose the next day, REX had fulfilled its coup objectives and assumed full control over the state."

#Downfall of Degrelle
wll.713.t:0 "Degrelle Shot!"
wll.713.d:0 "During a visit to the FN Herstal factory, Léon Degrelle has been shot by an estranged factory worker. Though his bodyguards immediately returned fire and killed the assailant, Degrelle remains in a critical condition and has been rushed to the nearest hospital. Due to Degrelle's consolidation of power over the last few years, it seems that there would be no clear successor to his legacy, leaving REX to the wolves if their charismatic leader were to die. All of Wallonia remains on a knife's edge as the news comes in regarding Degrelle's condition."
wll.713.a:0 "Degrelle is pronounced dead."
wll.713.b:0 "Degrelle makes a full recovery."

wll.714.t:0 "Infighting Within REX"
wll.714.d:0 "In the wake of the death of Degrelle, his second in command Victor Matthys has wrested control of the party to the consternation of other major players like Louis Collard and the minister of propaganda Georges Prosper Remi. Matthys' leadership qualities have quickly be outed as lackluster at best after he decided that the populace can only be kept in line with extreme repression. While it seems order has temporarily been restored, behind the façade of violence resistance keeps brewing and Matthys' rule may be shortlived."
wll.714.a:0 "Yet more turbulence."

wll.715.t:0 "Coup D'état in Wallonia!"
wll.715.d:0 "The succession crisis seems to have finally affected the army, which has risen up in protest against the cruel massacres commissioned by Matthys to eliminate his opponents. Supported by the PL and the POB, officers have ordered their soldiers to disobey all Rexist commands and tanks have been be seen rolling through the avenues of Liège towards the party headquarters. All the same, the remaining hardliners are unwilling to give up so easily and without a surrender by the Rexists a bloodbath is almost inevitable."
wll.715.a:0 "Demand they lay down their weapons."
wll.715.b:0 "Rexist loyalists retake key positions."

wll.716.t:0 "Consultation with Remi"
wll.716.d:0 "While Louis Collard has fortified himself with the REX hardliners inside the party headquarters, Georges Prosper Remi has been cooperating with the resistance since Degrelle's death seeking a return to democracy and a peaceful transition of power. While his efforts have proven futile in avoiding armed conflict so far, he still holds some sway within the nation and has convinced many of the other Rexists outside of the capital to surrender themselves to the army. While he has tried mediating with the remaining hardliners, all have come to naught and it seems that they will not go down without a fight."
wll.716.a:0 "Launch the attack."

wll.717.t:0 "Georges Deffontaine Assumes Temporary Control"
wll.717.d:0 "After a short but bloody siege of the party headquarters, the army has emerged victorious and has proclaimed Georges Deffontaine leader of provisionary government until elections are held. The POB and PL have immediately restarted their propaganda efforts and with REX having been disbanded by the military, Georges Prosper Remi has announced that he will be running for office to contain the remaining Rexist elements and help Wallonia on its way towards full democracy."

wll.718.d:0 "After the downfall of REX and the military coup, the elections are finally upon us. The POB under Fernand Dehousse has been polling excellently but has received some hits due to a damaging scandal concerning one of their party members. Auguste Buisseret is also doing well with his message of liberal democracy and has attracted many of the German capitalists. Georges Prosper Remi is, to the surprise of many, still following closely as well and might even pull a close victory out of the elections with his message of solidarity and national unity."

#POB wins the elections

wll.8.t:0 "POB Wins the Election"
wll.8.d:0 "Unsurprising to many, the POB was able to sway the voters and win a landslide victory. Internal strife however is damaging the party and long discussions can be heard in parliament discussing the future of the socialist party. Subfactions under Lucie Dejardin, Julien Lahaut and Walter Dauge are damaging Fernand Dehousse standing and may force his hand into a dangerous position. The syndicalists demand a quick and painless revolution while the more conservative faction prefers upholding the status quo with small socialist reforms."

wll.81.t:0 "Question of Leadership"
wll.81.d:0 "As the POB tries to settle in and form its cabinet, a motion of no confidence has been proclaimed against Fernand Dehousse calling him a traitor to the working class and unfit to rule. Though the syndicalist members support this motion, other sub-factions led by Julien Lahaut and Walter Dauge are less inclined to support them as this would result in syndicalist dominance within the party."

wll.82.t:0 "Bloodbath at Liège"
wll.82.d:0 "With no consensus within the POB, members of the extremist syndicalist and totalist factions have decided to handle the matters their own way. During yet another failing meeting between Fernand Dehousse and members of a new social liberal faction, masked assailants stormed the room butchering Fernand Dehousse and his staff. Over sixty high-ranking members of the POB were massacred after which the assailants left. Shocked by these events, Parliament has announced a day of national sorrow mourning the casualties of the attack."
wll.82.a:0 "Chaos reigns once more."

wll.83.t:0 "Lahaut Assumes Control"
wll.83.d:0 "With all opposition dealt with and no immediate response from the moderate syndicalists, Julien Lahaut has taken control of the POB and is starting to push for full on revolution, breaking the chains and liberating the worker class from capitalist oppression."
wll.83.a:0 "Dark times are upon us."

wll.84.t:0 "Military Disbanded"

#Degrelle Extra

wll.1327.t:0 "On the Matter of Belgian History and Identity"
wll.1327.d:0 "As we still work to establish what it means to truly be Belgian in this new order under the Rexists and Degrelle, many old ideas have begun to arise as to how we should organize our blossoming national and cultural identities. In the Lowlands’ past, many have tried to revive the Burfallen states of Burgundy and Lotharingia, such as Charles the Bold of the 1470’s, or otherwise have tried to foster similar glories and victories, like the divisive Leopold II, but all have ultimately failed. However, Degrelle commands the Belgian people like never before, and perhaps now our people are strong enough to reach out and reclaim their lost former glories. Should we adopt the title of the Burgundian State, or Valois Burgundy, which represented the height of our people’s influence and strength during the Late Middle Ages, should we harken back further to the state that created our very people and culture itself, the great Lotharingia of the 9th and 10th centuries - heirdom of the great Charlemagne and his Carolingian Empire, or should we abandon the ideas of both of these failed states, stick to our Belgicist ideals, and instead blaze a new path under God towards our Rexist future in this new and proud Belgium?"
wll.1327.a:0 "March to reclaim fallen glories and sullied titles. Hail the revived Burgundian State!"
wll.1327.b:0 "We shall undo the collapse of Middle Francia. Rise the new Lotharingia!"
wll.1327.c:0 "We are Belgium, now and forever! Unity makes strength!"

wll.1328.t:0 "The Fate of King Adalbert"
wll.1328.d:0 "Despite our Royalist position many within the Rexist Party and in the general public refuse to accept King Adalbert Hohenzollern. He had been installed as King after King Albert fled to Britain during the Weltkrieg. Unlike Albert however Adelbert never ruled Belgium, he ruled ‘Flanders-Wallonia as a sort of dual monarchy type situation akin to the Austro-Hungarians. This bastardization of the Belgian ideal along with his general weakness and transparent job as a mouthpiece of the Kaiser has meant that Adelbert never enjoyed the love of his people the way Albert did. Now that we are in power the hated ‘King’ is now rotting in the deepest, darkest, dankest cell we could find. However, we can't just leave him there forever without coming to some decision. Some Germanophiles in the administration urge us to put him back on the throne, except as a puppet to us rather than Berlin. While it would most assuredly piss the people off it would placate the Kaiser who watched our ascent to power with great concern. Should he be too displeased he could very well run over us in a fortnight. Another option is to invite Albert back from exile. This would gain as much favor in the public's eyes but again, it would anger the Kaiser. Not only would we kick his son out of the country but we would very plainly realign ourselves with the Entente of our past. Some fear that hopping back on the horse that failed us the first time will just lead us down the same road. A third option however is to simply declare Degrelle Regent of Belgium but refuse to make a decision at all. Depose Adalbert but refuse Albert. Not only would it allow for the situation to change on a dime should the Germans hold solidify or should the Entente pull off a miracle, but it would also give Degrelle a fancy new title."
wll.1328.a:0 "We will win the favor of Germany and let Adalbert keep his throne."
wll.1328.b:0 "Royalism without the royalty, what's wrong with that?"
wll.1328.c:0 "Make contact with the deposed House of Belgium."

wll.1329.t:0 "The Future Going Forward"
wll.1329.d:0 "With the Monarch question settled our next logical question is what to do on the foreign stage. Again three avenues have been proposed. The Germanophiles have suggested that we continue our connection to the Reich. They point out that the Commune is right on our border with an army many times larger than ours. If we were to break with the Reich, assuming Germany doesn't immediately invade and crush us under heel, the Commune could possibly do it instead. However, by staying within the Reich we would do so not as a German puppet as before but as an equal to the Kaiser and when the Commune inevitably strikes East into Germany, our frontier into the open plains of Northern France could be a major boon to the war effort for both sides allowing us to extract major concessions. Secondly we could embrace neutrality. This would give us the most freedom in our foreign adventures, but presents the most risk. WIthout a larger benefactor we would be at risk from both our South and East. The third option is almost as dangerous as going alone. The liberals, as they are at least, within the Party seek to draw us closer to the old Entente, now in exile in Canada and Africa. This will make us an object of the utmost importance to the Entente as it will give them a non-insignificant base from which to reclaim their homes. We can leverage this into generous concessions should the Entente emerge victorious. However, should the Entente fail Belgium will once more fall to the enemy and this time they may not be so kind as to leave us our independence."
wll.1329.a:0 "Belgium will prosper under the Reich!"

wll.1329.c:0 "Belgium's fate lies with our Entente allies!"

wll.1330.t:0 "A Proposition from the Rexists"
wll.1330.d:0 "Today Leon Degrelle has arrived in Wallonia to speak to Van Severen. He comes with a proposal that Flanders be given significant autonomy as long as Flanders ultimately subordinates itself to Brussels. Many in the VNV demand that we turn him away. They are betting that Degrelle does not have the muscle to force our compliance. If he did, why not start with it? Van Severen however is more hesitant. Flanders is more or less alone in the world with the Germans not caring enough to defend us and the Dutch too scared. If we were to refuse him and he were to invade, the VNV’s militia would be destroyed by the more professional Belgian Army. However, on the other hand, outside of the absolute row it would cause within the Party, giving up everything the VNV had gained up to this point would be spitting on the men who spent their lives getting us this far. After much deliberation Van Severen has made up his mind..."
wll.1330.a:0 "We will agree to Degrelle's deal."
wll.1330.b:0 "That fool won't talk us out of our sovereignty!"

wll.1331.t:0 "Van Severen Refuses!"
wll.1331.d:0 "When Degrelle arrived in Brussels the crowds that had gathered expecting a deal were disappointed. Reports from Antwerp tell of the Van Severen demanding more concessions from Degrelle and Degrelle refusing. This started the conversation down a rocky road to an outright shouting match between the two leaders which ended when Degrelle angrily stormed out of the room shouting profanities and obscenities so vile it could curl the hairs on a priest's neck. Back in Brussels however Degrelle now has a new decision to make, whether to invade Flanders. On one hand to do so would lead to the final completion of the Belgian ideal, the total unification of the nation without the concessions and handouts to the self-righteous Verdinaso.The ‘Flemish Nationalists’ could be torn away root and stem never to rise again. Not only that but it would recover Degrelle’s ego, damaged by the failed meeting. However, doves in the administration point out that Europe is a tinderbox much like it was in 1914. If we were to invade Flanders it could set all of Europe ablaze once again and if it does, Belgium would once again be torn apart by the fires of war. As the Belgian Army musters and Europe holds its breath, Degrelle comes to his decision."
wll.1331.a:0 "The people of Belgium are being denied their destiny, to war!"
wll.1331.b:0 "We must bide our time..."

wll.1332.t:0 "Negotiations Succeed!"
wll.1332.d:0 "After a marathon fifteen meeting full of tense words and angry mutterings the two leaders of Belgium and Flanders have come to an agreement. The VNV agreed to allow Flanders to once more be ruled directly from Brussels and the VNV National Militia, the pseudo-Fleming military, was disbanded. In return Flanders was given extraordinary autonomy in comparison to any other area of Belgium with an official agreement that said autonomy could not be infringed upon by Brussels ‘in the lifetimes of both leaders plus 99 years’. While many in the newly united Belgium celebrate the peaceful reunification of the country, the Rexist administration has already begun to plan for ways to subvert the Fleming Autonomy."
wll.1332.a:0 "Excellent!"

wll.1333.t:0 "Albert's Response"
wll.1333.d:0 "After weeks of stressful waiting we have received a message from the Exiled King Albert of Belgium, currently residing in Canada. He has agreed to return to Belgium and support Degrelle and his Rexists. However, one of his few provisions include us lightening our repression of ‘enemies of the state’ like the former aristocracy and the capitalists. This has left Degrelle with a hard choice. He had wanted Albert to come back. He himself liked the man and most of the country loved him. Having him back and wearing Rexist colors would do wonders to win over what sections of the population remain opposed to us. Not only that but it would draw us closer to the Entente and protection from the Germans and Commune. However, Degrelle is a supreme idealogue. For him, to lighten up his oppression of those who had worked so hard to keep Belgium down was almost unacceptable, even for a King. Not only that but the Entente are still in exile in Canada and Africa, a long way from Europe. What use could they be to Belgium in that state? After weighing his options and agonizing for hours, he finally sends a dispatch back to Albert with his response..."

wll.1333.b:0 "Never give up on our principles!"

wll.1334.t:0 "A Matter of Ideology"
wll.1334.d:0 "With Rex and the people finally united, we must mold our ideas together towards a coherent ideology. Degrelle could either create his own ideology, though this would likely isolate us politically, or we could adapt ourselves and draw more closely to one of two established movements. They are the Belgicists, a diverse coalition of Belgian nationalists pushing for Belgian independence and unified statehood composed from a diverse coalition of Conservative and Right-wing figures and groups, and the ideas of French Integral Nationalist theorist and Far-Right theorist Charles Maurass, international renowned as one of the leading Integralist thinkers. What would our direction and identity be?"

wll.1335.d:0 "Propaganda minister Georges Remi, more commonly known as Hergé, has produced a new issue in his comic series following the recently created 'Tintin' character, with this one being aimed at educating children about the dangers of Socialism. This newest adventure, titled ‘Tintin in the Land of the Communards’, has Tintin and his faithful companion Snowy going on a trip to Paris and the French countryside, only to be chased across the nation by Sorelian secret police and Revolutionary militiamen. As Tintin travels the nation, he sees the horrors of Socialism and Syndicalism firsthand, witnessing mass murders and burials, famine, disease, violence, and the other ill effects of a totalitarian police state. Selling out across the Reichspakt nations and Eastern Europe, and becoming contraband and banned literature behind the Red Veil, Tintin in the Land of the Communards has proven to be one of Hergé’s most popular pieces yet."
wll.1335.a:0 "That character sure looks like me doesn't it?"

wll.1336.d:0 "Despite railing against the financial elite, the Rexist Party has received support from wealthy industrialists in order to continue the operations of their businesses in Wallonia, and to further fund party activities. However, working with such elitist capitalists is against Rexist party doctrine and dogma, and some are beginning to call out this hypocrisy despite its apparent benefits. Will we betray our beliefs and continue to work with the Hypercapitalists, or will we keep true to our ideals and reject the deals of these snake-oil salesmen?"
wll.1336.a:0 "Not all capitalists are bad"

wll.1337.t:0 "The Colony at the Dark Heart Returns to its Rightful Masters"
wll.1337.d:0 "After much hard work and fierce fighting across the jungles and swamps of the Dark Continent’s core, our Rexist regime has finally reclaimed the lost Belgian colonies in Africa. The lands of Leopold II’s Freestate now once again lie fully in Belgian hands, but the Congo is far from being the stable and profitable colony it truly could be under the ingenious and God-guided brilliance of Rexism. The local administration, long suffering from the rigors of Germanification and conflict with the natives, has become a shattered and incapable husk that must be replaced. As the Rexist colonial office works to rebuild a new, sound, profitable, and secure imperialist apparatus alongside our allies in the UMHK and the Force Publique, they shall be on a tight leash as Brussels works to never let Leopoldville slip free ever again. \n\nAlthough the colony will be allowed nominal autonomy, it shall still be tied deeply to the Rexist party and its functions, and all that is now left to do is to choose a new face of the colonial administration. The most widely agreed upon candidate is, of course, the King, who many see as the rightful ruler and even owner of the Congo as the heir of the great Leopold II, but his position is tenuous at best and powerless or absent at worst. However, many Belgian colonials who have been working in the Congo for years or even decades instead support either Edgar Sengier or Émille Janssens. Sengier is the CEO of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga - the largest single privately-owned colonial company in Africa, and one of the most profitable mining outfits in the world. Sengier knows how to run a colonial economy, has deep ties with the local mercenaries that could aid our cause, and is known to be a devout Catholic, though he himself is not a member of our party, and has been derided as many party members as a ‘Hypercapitalist’. His main rival, Janssens, is known at the ‘Petit Maniaque’, and for good reason. Shorter than most, this small but driven military man leads the Congolese colonial defense force called the Force Publique, and has been known to harbor deep ties to ideas of Belgian nationalism, exceptionalism, and imperialism. Many within our military and within the FP support Janssens despite his track record of overly harsh and violent colonial policies, and due to his deep dedication to following in the footsteps of Leopold II’s Free State. \n\nOpposing these main groups however is the main body of the Rexist party itself, whose members desire a more direct hold over this bountiful colonial prize. These party loyalists hold that José Streel - chief philosopher and founder of early Rexist thought - or Victor Matthys - second-in-command in the Rexist party under Degrelle - would make the best leaders of this reclaimed colony as they bring Rexist ideology to Africa, while others raise Georges Prosper Remi, or Hergé, as their candidate due to his devotion to Congolese colonialism as seen in his writings. Finally, the most diehard fanatics deny all these candidates, stating that Degrelle alone has the foresight and ability to command the Dark Heart. Who shall be chosen?"
wll.1337.a:0 "The King is the only man with the right to rule over Leopold’s Congo."
wll.1337.b:0 "Degrelle’s right-hand man and party co-leader Victor Matthys shall lead."
wll.1337.c:0 "Degrelle’s loyal lackey and the main philosopher of Rexism, José Streel, will lead."
wll.1337.e:0 "Rexist moderate and ardent colonialist Georges Remi shall bring the White Man’s Burden to Congo."
wll.1337.f:0 "Director of the UMHK Edgar Sengier has the mind to make the Congo profitable once more."
wll.1337.g:0 "Head of the Force Publique, the Little Maniac Émille Janssens, shall create a secure colony."
wll.1337.h:0 "No man but Degrelle himself has the vision needed to civilize the Dark Heart."

wll.1338.t:0 "Join the Latin Union?"
wll.1338.d:0 "The Carlists in Spain have gathered like minded Catholic nations into an alliance called the Latin Union. This coalition of pious partners would surely make strong and trustworthy allies under God, but may draw us into foreign wars and other conflicts. Should we join them?"
wll.1338.a:0 "Of course we will join them!"
wll.1338.b:0 "We are fine on our own."

wll.1339.t:0 "The 'Rexists' of Wallonia"
wll.1339.d:0 "Leon degrelle and his Rexist Party have taken control in Wallonia and have created a Catholic Corporatist state that flies the cross of Burgundy just as we do. A fellow Catholic state, these brothers of the faith would likely make great allies, giving us a strong foothold in Northern Europe, but possibly drawing the ire of Germany along with them. Should we invite these soldiers of Christ to our own Latin Union?"
wll.1339.a:0 "Send the invitation."
wll.1339.b:0 "It's best we don't involve ourselves in the lowlands again."

wll.1340.t:0 "The Face of New Rexism"
wll.1340.d:0 "With the death of Degrelle and the ascendency of his chief loyalists, Streel and Matthys have become the dominant faces of the Rexist Party. However, they have their disagreements, and many push for one or the other to rise to dominance over the other, becoming the new Degrelle as it were. Should one of these two figures rise to become the face of the new movement, or should we maintain the faceless leadership of the wider Party?"
wll.1340.a:0 "Acting leader of the Party Matthys will lead."
wll.1340.b:0 "Chief philosopher of our movement Streel shall lead."
wll.1340.c:0 "Maintain the faceless facade of the Rexist Council."

wll.1341.t:0 "Remembering Degrelle"
wll.1341.d:0 "With the fall of Degrelle and the rise of the new regime, we must decide how Degrelle should be remembered and honored, if at all. Many are up in arms over this debate, for Degrelle has managed to become one of the most divisive figures in modern Belgian history, with leagues of his loyalists arguing against scores of his detractors in the streets. We must decide upon Degrelle’s legacy and fast."
wll.1341.a:0 "Honor his grace with statues and public works around the nation."
wll.1341.b:0 "Remember him as the man he was, and move on."
wll.1341.c:0 "Reveal to all the monster he truly was."

wll.1342.t:0 "The New Face of the Congo"
wll.1342.d:0 "With the colonial ideal of Degrelle faltering with his death, the Congo colony that we have reclaimed must decide upon a new administration that is in line with our new realities and vision. Who shall we choose to lead the Dark Heart of Africa into a new age of imperialism, and who would create a more prosperous and stable colony?"
wll.1342.a:0 "Victor Matthys will bring Degrelle’s vision to the Dark Heart."
wll.1342.b:0 "José Streel will bring Rexism to the Congo."
wll.1342.c:0 "Head of the Force Publique, the Little Maniac Émille Janssens will bring order."
wll.1342.e:0 "Georges Prosper Remi will continue the White Man’s Burden in the Congo."
wll.1342.f:0 "Edgar Sengier, Director of the UMHK, will make the Congo richer than ever before."
wll.1342.g:0 "Moïse Tshombe, colonial ally and mercantile genius, will bring the Congo prosperity."

wll.1342.m:0 "The King, by right of Leopold II, owns the Congo."

wll.1343.t:0 "A Matter of the Flag"
wll.1343.d:0 "Our flag, the Burgundian Cross of red on a white background, just so happens to also be the flag of Carlist Spain. With their victory over the CNT-FAI and the Royalists and Republicans, their banner - our banner - has become the national flag of Spain as well. This has led to confusion in both nations during diplomacy and international relations, and has caused friction between our two states. Some have suggested that we should change the white background of our flag to black in order to match the colors of Rexism while also creating our own unique identity, but Burgundian loyalists stand by the white, calling any who call for a change in flag to be revisionist traitors and unpious cuckolds. What should we do?"
wll.1343.a:0 "To be confused with our oppressors is a most egregious sin. Paint it black!"
wll.1343.b:0 "Differentiate ourselves further from the Carlists with a gold trim."
wll.1343.c:0 "It is our flag! The Spanish and any idiot that confuses the two can all go shove it."

wll.1344.t:0 "The Fate of the Crown"
wll.1344.d:0 "Rexism was an inherently monarchist system, despite some pushing for the idea of ‘monarchism without a monarch.’ However, with the fall of Rexism and the rise of the Republican Belgicist movement, we must decide on the fate of the Crown. Does this united Belgium need a King, or should we maintain this Republican identity we have forged alone?"
wll.1344.a:0 "We need no monarch!"
wll.1344.b:0 "Allow the rightful King to take his throne."
wll.1344.c:0 "Allow the German King to take his throne for protection."

wll.1345.t:0 "The Dark Heart Reclaimed"
wll.1345.d:0 "Through able leadership, sheer determination, and strong will, the rightful owners of the Dark Continent’s Dark Heart have returned to their colony, for the Congo is finally and fully in Belgian hands once again. The Belgian flag flies aboves Leopoldville and Elisabethville, the UMHK’s vast profits and mineral wealth now flows solely through Belgian hands and pockets, and the wider Vrijstaat is now ours once more. Though it shall take some time until the Congo colony is in a stable and profitable state again, our colonial department and imperialist nationalists can rest easy now that the crown jewel of the Belgian Empire has been recaptured. Now let us see what our future further has in store for us."
wll.1345.a:0 "The property of Leopold II has been reclaimed!"

wll.1346.t:0 "A United Future for the Low Countries"
wll.1346.d:0 "Shunning preposterous and ludicrous ideas for international unification based on the pretense of centuries-old failed states and empires, we moderate Belgicists pursued the sensible and rational option, and have solely worked to create a strong, free, and united Belgium. However, through diplomacy and conflict, we have also come to control the wider Low Countries, uniting Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in a dream long since thought impossible and longer forgotten. With the Low Countries under our control, we could expand the Belgicist idea to include all nationalities and cultures of the Lowlands instead of just the Walloons and Flemish, finally going through with the scrapped plan of the BeNeLux Union - an equal tripartite union in name and nation of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Alternatively, we could just expand Belgium and proclaim a greater Belgian state of sorts as we expand our territorial holdings. What should we do?"
wll.1346.a:0 "Support the BeNeLux plan!"
wll.1346.b:0 "We are Belgium, now and forever!"

wll.1347.t:0 "The Realm of Lotharius"
wll.1347.d:0 "Lotharius, kin of Charles the Great and first king of Lotharingia, lorded over the lands we call home today, but his domain once stretched even further. From Marseille and Southern France to Northern Italy and the Papal States, Lothar once lorded over a vast union of French and Italians in addition to what would become we Belgians. Should we restore these past claims and glories, and march to reclaim the Realm of Lotharius in full?"
wll.1347.a:0 "We shall reclaim the lands of Lotharius in full!"
wll.1347.b:0 "We do not need Italians in our pristine state!"

wll.1348.t:0 "The Realm of Charles the Bold"
wll.1348.d:0 "Charles the Bold, kin of Charles the Great and first king of West Francia, lorded over the lands we call France today. From Normandy and Paris down to the Pyrenees Mountains, Charles the Bold once lorded over a vast union to the west of his father’s shattered realm, but these lands rightfully were claimed by the other offspring of Charlemagne, and by this right, we can properly claim these lands to this day through our ties to Lothar. Should we restore these past claims and glories, and march to reclaim the Realm of Charles the Bold in full, or perhaps extend our ambition to the Kingdom of France that followed?"
wll.1348.a:0 "We shall reclaim the lands of Charles!"
wll.1348.b:0 "We shall claim the whole crown of France!"
wll.1348.c:0 "By God no. We have enough frogs in our borders as it is."

wll.1349.t:0 "The Realm of Louis the German"
wll.1349.d:0 "Louis the German, kin of Charles the Great and first king of East Francia, lorded over the lands we call Germany today. From the Rhein river and Hamburg to Munster and Munich, eastern Germany was dominated by Louis, uniting the Germanic locals under his rule in the wake of the collapse of his father’s domain. These lands rightfully were claimed by the other offspring of Charlemagne, and by this right, we can properly claim these lands to this day through our ties to Lothar. Should we restore these past claims and glories, and march to reclaim the Realm of Louis the German in full or go further and claim the greatest extent of East Francia, resting against the Oder river? But perhaps some say we may yet go further still and claim not his lands but his title as King of Germany, and thus place unto our hands the ambition of uniting all Germans in Europe"
wll.1349.a:0 "We shall reclaim the lands of Louis!"
wll.1349.b:0 "East Francia grew to meet the Oder, so shall we"
wll.1349.c:0 "Louis was king to all Germans, and we shall rule them such"

wll.1350.d:0 "We lay claim now to the realm of Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, seeking to unite all his lands beneath our hand. West Francia, East Francia, and Lotharingia shall all be ruled by one hand once more, and the people of Western and Central Europe shall cry out in joy under the rightful rule of Degrelle and his Rexists. However, with our claiming of these lands, radical zealots and diehard fanatics within the Rexist party have begun to suggest that Degrelle take this historical leap just one tiny step more forward. These feverish loyalists suggest that Degrelle proclaim himself the new Emperor of these lands, sidelining any existing government and executive to be the one and only monarch of this new Carolingian Empire under a new Degrelle-Karling Dynasty. Of course this plan is absolutely mad and detested by almost all who hear it, but the idea has sparked some interest in the scheming and ever-ambitious mind of our loud and boisterous leader. There is no way we could go through with this ludicrous plan though...right?"

However, with our claiming of these lands, radical zealots and diehard fanatics within the Rexist party have begun to suggest that [root.getleader] take this historical leap just one tiny step more forward. These feverish loyalists suggest that the new Rexist party leader [root.getleader] proclaim himself the new Emperor of these lands in an homage to Degrelle’s dream and supposed final wish, sidelining any existing government and executive to be the one and only monarch of this new Carolingian Empire under a new dynasty named in honor of our fallen hero and national fathers - the Degrelle-Karling Dynasty. Of course this plan is absolutely mad and detested by almost all who hear it, but the idea has sparked some interest in the scheming and ever-ambitious mind of our loud and boisterous leader.

In these new swathes of land, a new democratic federation shall rise in the image of the old Carolingian Dynasty’s Carolingian Empire, paying homage to our history and ancestry as we skyrocket into a new and bright future with Central Europe united under one glorious flag and under one Godly and equal union."

wll.1353.t:0 "The Congo Calls..."
wll.1353.d:0 "The colonial empire of Belgium was never monumentally massive, but it was proud, and it was largely centered around the Congo. After our defeat in the Great War, or the Weltkrieg as the world increasingly calls it, we were forced to adopt the identity of Flanders-Wallonia under the German boot, and with it, our empire was forced into union with theirs. Our Congo, the Congo of Leopold II, was forcibly placed under a dual-government of German and Belgium officials, with the Belgian old guard slowly being phased out over time in favor of new German blood from their so-called Fatherland. However, our wings are now spread free and we fly on our own, and the Congo calls to their rightful masters once again. Shall we set sail on the warpath to Leopoldville to reclaim Africa’s Dark Heart, or shall we abandon our African colonial ambitions for good?"
wll.1353.a:0 "...and we answer! To Leopoldville and beyond, boys!"

Taking our Belgicist ideas to new heights in order to include all those within the realm of our bloodkin, some radicals and zealots among our numbers suggest for us to put this claim into action, preparing our armies for war in order to march across the lands of old Capetian Europe. If we were to accept this ludicrous plan, we would soon march across the lands of France, Iberia, Southern Italy, and beyond, risking the lives of millions for a chance at true glory and prosperity. What shall we decide?"

wll.121.t:0 "PL Spreads Propaganda"
wll.121.d:0 "The PL has focused on countering the fear instilled into the middle class by the Catholics against the Socialists. 'Carnaval... after Easter, the Citizen has become wise enough to see through these lies!'"

Mittelafrikan meddling however is starting to interfere with their interests and their government has imposed restrictions on the company. Therefore they have decided to withdraw most of their funds and to take loans with Walloon banks instead of German ones. To achieve this though, they will need support from our government and an adaption to our laws to enable them an easy transfer.

In return, UMHK will pay an increased amount of tax and will build housing, hospitals and schools for the local population. A new trade agreement will be signed increasing Walloon import from Mittelafrika while also granting more favourable arrangements for our government. Due to the economic troubles we are experiencing, allowing the Flemish-Walloons to invest in our nation would be hugely beneficial but would also increase their influence over the Congolese region.

They have opened their eyes to the weakness of effeminate and tainted democracy and thrown off their oppressors. Instead they have flocked to the Red and Black Banner of the Rexist Party led by Leon Degrelle. Once a fringe movement few expected to amount to anything, now Leon Degrelle, famed for his loud and passionate speeches, speaks to millions and has an entire nation hanging on his every word. The only question is where this unlikely leader shall take it."

Some have even alleged that they have already begun to plot our overthrow! If that is true then we must strike first and with such ferocity that they will be unable to retaliate!

The one we are left with however, King Adalbert, is viewed by most of the Party and by the country as a whole as little more than a puppet with the Kaiser pulling his strings. If we are to achieve our greater ambitions we must decide what to do with him. Do we keep him like some Germanophiles within our administration want us to, get rid of him in compliance with the popular will or even invite the ‘true’ King of Belgium back?"

WLL_Replace_The_Ambassador_To_Germany_desc:0 "As we spread our wings and fly to our ultimate destiny a very large monster looms on the horizon. The Kaiser has watched our rise and rule so far with intense interest and his ambassadors in Brussels are pressing us for a decision on our future relationship with Germany. Of course they want us to keep our status as a German satellite, and the appeal of protection from the Syndicalists by the Heer is tempting. However some want us to break free completely, damn the consequences! They however also admit said consequences would surely be a swift invasion by said Heer, a war that few have any illusions of our victory in. However, as in all things, there must be a middle ground between groveling dog and a hopeless war. For all of his boisterousness, Degrelle can be mighty diplomatic. Maybe we should send him to Berlin to talk things out."

WLL_Break_The_Banksters_desc:0 "One of Degrelles' many hates is bankers. Those fat cats and lazy slobs sit around and watch their hoard of money grow like the dragons of old. Also just like the dragons of old their effects on the country they inhabit have been uniformly negative. Black Monday continues to drag the world economy through the mud! If Belgium is to achieve her destiny then it cannot be held hostage by some greedy, fat faux noble who had barely lifted a finger his whole life! To prevent the bankers and their ilk from holding their knife to our throats for all time he shall break up the banking system and decentralize it. Doing so would allow for more freedom to respond to the next Black Monday and allow Belgium to rise while others fall."

They drive their citizens into early graves building grandiose monuments to Marx and their own homegrown ‘revolutionaries’. Seeing the decay that has dragged these once adequate nations down has only reinforced our hatred of the Syndicalists. Our own Syndicalist movement the PoB has remained a thorn in the side of the government since its founding. If we are to truly secure our state from Syndicalist revolution and terror we must crush them now while they are still weak."

WLL_Government_Of_Action:0 "A Government of Action"
WLL_Government_Of_Action_desc:0 "The Government before the Weltkrieg was too caught up in the divide between Flanders and Wallonia to do much. Any move they feared would drive one half of the country to secession. Of course during the Weltkrieg they had bigger things to do, like lose a war. However even after it the new German dominated government failed to be of much use either. One thing both of these regimes lacked was a passion and drive. Adelbert and Albert were both content with things remaining as close to the status quo as possible. However as a revolutionary party the Rexists demand change. They demand a centralized state, a strong state, a state worthy of its people's devotion! This is a demand that Degrelle is more than happy to follow through with. No longer will we be mired in the muck of inaction and lethargy! We will move forwards into the future, even if we have to drag the rest of the country along with us!"

WLL_Distribute_Christus_Rex:0 "The Voice of REX"
WLL_Distribute_Christus_Rex_desc:0 "For almost his entire political career Leon Degrelle has used the newspaper Christus Rex as his main mouthpiece. However, for most of his entire political career Christus Rex has maintained a lackluster readerbase. Now that he is in power though Degrelle will seek to change this. He will turn Christus Rex into the official government newspaper and promote its readership across the nation. While you may listen to a man talk all day, it's what he writes that he truly believes."

WLL_Help_The_Helpless_desc:0 "As a young man in university, while writing for the body's paper, Degrelle witnessed how the poorest of the poor live in the slums of the cities. He was particularly struck by the sorry state these poorest of children lived in. Watching them slowly starve to death on the streets affected him greatly. Now that he has real power Degrelle has decided to do something about it, since the previous governments refused to. Degrelle has established a network of social homes for poor children to sleep in some sort of comfort and get their meals. However this is just the first step in a long road to make sure that no child in our country sleeps cold and hungry."

WLL_Introduce_Corporatism:0 "Reject 'Hypercapitalism'"
WLL_Introduce_Corporatism_desc:0 "While it is clear that Socialism and Syndicalism are cancerous, the same can be said about hypercapitalism as well. The reckless spending and thrift of societies that follow it are what led to Black Monday and the worldwide collapse that it caused. Degrelle knows this and so he has resolved to keep the poison of needless thrift out of his new state."

WLL_Military_Propaganda:0 "Mandatory Military Service"
WLL_Military_Propaganda_desc:0 "While Degrelle himself never served in the army, he and by extension the Party as a whole, knows the importance of a military in the states development. While the use of an army as an object of national defense and instrument of foreign policy are obvious, its clear the Army has other uses. Degrelle has realized the Army can be the breeding ground for the new sense of morality he wishes to hammer into the population. By instilling the values of honor, nationalism and a strict moral fiber into the soldiers it would go a long way to forging the new backbone of the nation. To further spread these new values and to boost the Army’s available manpower Degrelle has also decreed that every male from 18 - 50 must serve at least 4 years in the military."

WLL_Catholic_Morality:0 "Catholic Morality"
WLL_Catholic_Morality_desc:0 "To many the Catholic Church is a decrepit and ancient establishment ill suited to the modern day. To the Rexists however the Catholic Church is a group of God’s chosen and the rejection of the Church would inevitably lead to a rejection of God and the degeneration of the body politic. To rebuild the lagging morals of the Belgian people Degrelle has begun to adopt many Catholic teachings into law, with some modification, and help people focus on the right path. The path of a close-knit and nuclear family bound by blood and by God to the nation they love so much. This ideal Belgian will also reject the sins of the Hypercapitalist and immorality of the Syndicalist to achieve a closeness to God unattainable to other nations."

WLL_Rural_Ideal:0 "The Rural Ideal"
WLL_Rural_Ideal_desc:0 "Degrelle’s humble upbringing in the rural Ardennes has inspired a long lived adoration for the ‘Rural Ideal’ of society. This is one of closely tied communities working for the good of each other and the nation as a whole while remaining pious and nationalist Belgians ready to defend the land they work. This is opposed to the weak and disjointed cities where men with no land feel no love for said land. Not only that but they frolic in their degeneration and flaunt it as a status symbol. We must reinforce the primacy of the rural areas through extensive agricultural reform to make living in such areas all the more tempting to those who are not too far gone."

WLL_Maurassian_Influences:0 "Maurrasian Influences"
WLL_Maurassian_Influences_desc:0 "One of the greatest sources of inspiration for the 15-year-old Léon Degrelle was undoubtedly the ideologue and master of the Action Française, the eminent Charles Maurras. Although Degrelle had his own ideals, Maurras was undoubtedly the man who introduced him to the nationalist milieu and from whom the Rex leader still draws inspiration today, notably his idea of a traditionalist corporatist Catholic state. It is only normal for our proud state to honor this great man and his great intellectual and ideological contribution to our ideology, which can even be considered as the Belgian version of Maurrassism!"

WLL_Demand_Our_Rightfull_Land_desc:0 "In the Treaty of Arras the Germans forced their puppet Adelbert to give up Verviers and Arel to the Empire. Since then Adelbert has shown zero signs of ever wanting that rightful Belgian land back. However, with Degrelle having consolidated his power and the German Empire’s hold over Mitteleuropa weakening by the day, Degrelle has decided that now is the time to finally demand the lost territories back!"

WLL_Above_Party_Politics_desc:0 "To many just a few years ago our position seemed radical, even dangerous. However now that we are in power we have shown just how wrong these naysayers were. The people have learned that we have only Belgium’s best interests at heart and they have paid us back in spades. Not only do more and more people join our party by the day but the Parliament, once a greater enemy than the Germans, has begun to support Degrelle’s beliefs. This is probably helped by many Parliamentarians switching over to the Rexist Party as our star rose. In any case Belgium, once on the very brink of tearing itself apart, has united under us wholeheartedly. We are finally ready to face the future and bring Belgium to its rightful place among the great powers."

To forge a new national identity is no easy task, but the mighty and God-blessed Rexists can shoulder this herculean task. We shall forge Flanders and Wallonia into one united whole, welded together with the fiery heat of Belgian Nationalism and fervent patriotism. All in the nation shall stand with these ideas, or they will get out of our way."

WLL_VNV_Outreach:0 "Reach Out to the Verdinaso"
WLL_VNV_Outreach_desc:0 "While to many in the Rexist Party our beliefs in Belgium trump the Verdinaso’s belief in an independent Flanders, Degrelle however sees things differently. While he too would much prefer Flanders to be as Belgian as Wallonia, to force it upon them would only bring division and Civil War. That is why, over his own Party’s strong objections, Degrelle has arranged a meeting with Joris Van Severen, the leader of the Verdinaso to offer him significant autonomy in Flanders as long as Flanders remains under Brussel’s control. If van Severen sees reason and accepts this most generous of offers then Belgium will be more united than it has ever been."

That is the motto and anthem of our movement, exemplifying Degrelle’s visionary guidance and our dedication to the radical and true tenants of our ideology that shall reshape Belgium and our society for the better. In this miraculous and God-ordained metamorphosis, we shall unite around our faith, our culture, and our history, fighting back against the foul forces that seek to destroy all that is Belgian as we sally forth into destiny. With one foot rooted in our storied past - the past of the beloved Charles the Great and the infamous Leopold II, we shall ride forth into our pious, prosperous, and proud future!

Though still an ardent colonialist, imperialist, and Right-wing Belgian Nationalist, Hergé does not subscribe to the same violent and overtly Reactionary views of the mainline Rexist party and it's now-dead founder, and instead wishes to blaze a new path forward for the movement that is less antagonistic, more pious, and more loyal to its own teachings."

Let Liberal Nationalism ring true and free!"

WLL_The_Sillon_Industriel_desc:0 "The Sillon Industriel is the industrial heartland of Wallonia, it's output unparalleled.

WLL_Redefine_Walloon_Expertise_desc:0 "Wallonia has long been one of Europe's foremost industrial regions, and our people possess skills relevant to such an economy.

WLL_Encourage_Frontaliers_desc:0 "Many of our people work abroad in the nations of Mitteleuropa and send remitances home. This represents a sizable portion of our national economy, and while it hurts our industrial centres to some extent by shrinking the labor market, the increased disposable income this reality brings is surely economically beneficial. We should further encourage the practice and negotiate with Germany to reduce restrictions on individual Frontaliers."
WLL_Create_The_Industrial_Commitee:0 "Create the Industrial Committee"
WLL_Create_The_Industrial_Commitee_desc:0 "The nation's many great industrial companies compete vigorously for the slightest economic advantage.

WLL_Exploitation_of_Charleroi_Glass_Industry_desc:0 "Charleroi is one of the foremost producers of glass in the world.

WLL_Trench_Warfare_desc:0 "Untold numbers of men went to their deaths in the trenches of the Weltkrieg. Such a style of warfare, however, favors the defender.

WLL_Panzer_Doctrine:0 "Panzer Doctrine"
WLL_Panzer_Doctrine_desc:0 "British combined arms operations nearly proved the achilles heal of the German Empire in the Weltkrieg. Unlike so many foolish generals who would hide in their trenches, we see the promise of an army built around panzers. Now is the era of armoured warfare."

WLL_Light_Tank_Program:0 "Light Tank Program"
WLL_Light_Tank_Program_desc:0 "Light armour is both easy to produce in large quantities and capable of moving with blinding speed. To maximize agility, we should develop new tanks, that while small and lightly armoured, can execute complicated manoeuvres at a breakneck pace."

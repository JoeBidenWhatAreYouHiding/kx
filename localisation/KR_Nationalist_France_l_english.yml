NFA_focus:0 "French Republic Focus Tree"

NFA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the French Revolution of 1919, the discredited parliamentary government, having evacuated to Algiers, was rapidly toppled by Ferdinand Foch, who consolidated his military junta until his death in 1929. His successor, Philippe Pétain, has so far taken a more conciliatory attitude to the forces of democracy, reconciling with liberal-conservatives and delegating some power to the Assembly. However, Pétain's subtle ties to the deeply Catholic and nationalist Croix-de-Feu, and increasing discontent with parliamentary power within the military, is sure to cause trouble as the National French prepare to take back their homeland..."

NFA_troops_on_the_streets:0 "Pétain Holds On"
NFA_troops_on_the_streets_desc:0 "With the political crisis reaching a breaking point, and the junta embittered against civilian politics, Maréchal Pétain has given into the pressure, and taken the fateful decision to forcibly occupy the Assembly. The last sembalances of democratic rule are being swept away, with the Junta now focused on re-organising and militarising the state and society, while a rump parliament rubber-stamps its laws in the presence of armed soldiers."
NFA_officers_in_govt:0 "Officers in the Government"
NFA_officers_in_govt_desc:0 "As we secure the position of the junta, it is essential that we further fill government positions with trustworthy officers, who know from their own experience of military life that only discipline and authority yields good results. Furthermore, the officer corps is heavily invested in preserving the junta, lest our rivals investigate or punish them. As such, a government of officers will ensure greater loyalty to Pétain than ever."
NFA_demand_the_assemblys_loyalty:0 "Ensure the Assembly's Loyalty"
NFA_demand_the_assemblys_loyalty_desc:0 "Civilian politicians can be allowed to undermine national unity and our preparations for the liberation no longer. It is time to put a stop to their disloyalty and petty bickering. We must ensure that the civilian politicians of the nation understand their secondary and advisory role to the President. Only then can we decide what to do with their parties."
NFA_a_new_premier:0 "A New Premier"
NFA_a_new_premier_desc:0 "Since his self-coup, Pétain has ruled alone as both President and Prime Minister. However, the old marshal has never enjoyed day-to-day administration, nor does he have the time at his current age to engage in such matters while pre-occupied as both Head of State and a senior general. As such, he has resolved to delegate his position to a loyal member of his clique in the army, and leave ordinary matters of state to them, allowing for a more capable and efficient government."
NFA_a_new_constitution:0 "Suspend the Constitution"
NFA_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "Although our consolidation of power over the last months has been vital for France to be saved, it has hardly been legal. In order to legitimise the continued dictatorship, and further free ourselves from divisive civilian politics, we must suspend the Constitution of the Third Republic, giving the Maréchal a freer hand to lead France to glory, and liberate our brothers and sisters in the métropole."
NFA_memories_of_verdun:0 "Memories of Verdun"
NFA_memories_of_verdun_desc:0 "It was the Battle of Verdun in 1916, when he heroically held off the German swine, that truly made Pétain's career. and endeared him to the people. Now, with more great battles, this time to free France itself, on the horizon, we must revive the memories of the heroism of the Great War: not least the heroism of Pétain himself, whose popularity will doubtless recieve a significant boost from our campaigns."
NFA_seek_clergy_support:0 "Seek Support from the Clergy"
NFA_seek_clergy_support_desc:0 "The secularism of the republic has long alienated the Catholic church, with good Catholic men and women often drawn to needlessly radical movements in response. However, now that much of the republic has been swept away, and with many right-wing Catholics supportive of Pétain's strong and assertive leadership, we have a golden opportunity to mend our relations with the Church. By meeting with prominent clergymen and displaying Pétain's own faith, we shall truly endear ourselves to the God-fearing common man."
NFA_morality_and_service:0 "Morality and Service"
NFA_morality_and_service_desc:0 "With the clergy and army behind us, we can deepen our rhetoric of social conservatism and militarism, emphasising that traditional values go hand in hand with patriotism and self-sacrifice. By reviving the memory of French heroes of ages past, and encouraging patriotic sermons from the clergy, we can show to the people that it is their Christian duty to dedicate themselves to free France."
NFA_chantiers_de_jeunesse:0 "Chantiers de la Jeunesse"
NFA_chantiers_de_jeunesse_desc:0 "In order to bolster our support and position, and promote patriotism and family values, a new initiative has been proposed: camps at which young men will stay for a period of time where they will be taught to love God, to value hard work, and to love nature, besides absorbing a great deal of patriotism and respect for the Maréchal in the process."
NFA_cult_of_the_marechal:0 "The Cult of the Maréchal"
NFA_cult_of_the_marechal_desc:0 "Over the past months, our propaganda initiatives and traditionalist policies have caused Pétain's personal popularity to skyrocket. Reminded of his heroism at Verdun, and shown that he is a good Catholic dedicated to France, the people have increasingly come to support the old marshal, knowing him to be a responsible and determined man, under whose leadership France will prosper. It would be wise to encourage this immense popularity, and capitalise on it to further entrench our government."
NFA_la_revolution_nationale:0 "La Révolution Nationale"
NFA_la_revolution_nationale_desc:0 "With the abolishment of many republican institutions, the end of pretences of democracy, and our return to traditional values, a great change has come over French society. Maréchal Pétain has embraced this, proclaiming it the 'National Revolution': the true French spirit has forcefully asserted itself once more, and all who oppose it, be they republican demagogues or socialist traitors, will be swept away."
NFA_our_sole_purpose:0 "Our Sole Purpose"
NFA_our_sole_purpose_desc:0 "With the army now well and truly in charge of France, we are at last free to focus on the one great purpose for which the Military Government exists: the liberation of France. Whether or not we believe dictatorship to be right in the long term, we must embrace strong leadership so long as we are in exile, for only that can free us from the communard scum. Without the vested powers of the republic, we can now vastly expand our military investments."
NFA_militarise_society:0 "Militarise Society"
NFA_militarise_society_desc:0 "If France is to be liberated, the whole population must be dedicated to the great task before us. It will be no easy feat, but it must be done if we are once more to be among our fellow Frenchmen in liberty and under God. As such, we must promote militaristic culture and patriotism among the people, to ready the nation for the great war that looms ahead, and to legitimise our rule."
NFA_everything_for_the_liberation:0 "Everything for the Liberation"
NFA_everything_for_the_liberation_desc:0 "The great effort to free France will require the total commitment, total dedication, of every single patriot. Nobody can be found slacking, and all must do their duty for the patrie. Only through the shared determination of the whole nation can we hope to see the beauty of Paris once again. As such, we must use our propaganda to emphasise the need for total dedication, and greatly tighten conscription."
NFA_work_with_loyal_businesses:0 "Work with Loyal Businesses"
NFA_work_with_loyal_businesses_desc:0 "Pétain's regime has always enjoyed good relations with the world of business, and with our consolidation of power we can further capitalise on this. By granting favourable deals to businessmen who can prove their loyalty, and encouraging ideas of patriotism and class cooperation among business leaders, we can use our ties to the free market to greatly strengthen our hand."
NFA_arms_subsidies:0 "Arms Subsidies"
NFA_arms_subsidies_desc:0 "If there's one thing we need more than anything to free France, it's the arms and ammunition to wage war against an enemy that outnumbers us by many scores. As such, it is simply essential that we encourage business leaders to invest in armament production, by heavily subsidising the industry and offering less... official favourable treatment to those who can supply it."
NFA_la_france_enivree:0 "La France Enivrée"
NFA_la_france_enivree_desc:0 "There is one thing we must never forget, and that is that France is still held prisoner under Communard tyranny. Every day, good Catholics and valiant patriots suffer under the boot of Godless socialist scum, forced to live under a warmongering and degenerate regime. Not until our countrymen no longer have to suffer such a vile assault on their rights and faith can we resume the 'normality' of which our opponents love to speak."
NFA_unity_in_struggle:0 "Unity in Struggle"
NFA_unity_in_struggle_desc:0 "The task that lies before us, the task of setting the métropole free from the socialist filth, will be far from easy. We can expect no small amount of pain, loss, and bloodshed. But if there is one good thing that we can expect, it is unity and brotherhood among the people. All will share in the fight to free France, all will share in our triumphs and tragedies. And finally, after all the hardship and struggle, all will share in the freedom and peace that it is our mission to restore to the French people."
NFA_the_lion_roars:0 "The Lion Roars"
NFA_the_lion_roars_desc:0 "With our consolidation of power complete, and our preparations to reclaim the métropole well underway, the roar of the Lion of Verdun now resounds from Algiers, across Europe and Africa alike. The socialist filth must know that we are more than ready to crush them, and send them to hell where they belong, and they must know that the fateful day when we shall do so is drawing ever closer! Vive le Maréchal!"

### AF ###

NFA_la_restauration:0 "La Restauration"
NFA_la_restauration_desc:0 "With the AF's position in the government secure, we can make good on our promises to restore the Duc de Guise, Jean d'Orléans, to the French throne. With his influence rapidly giving way to the AF, on whom he is becoming reliant for continued support, Pétain shall have to oversee the transition from republic to monarchy, as his junta withers away."
NFA_emphasise_maurrasisme:0 "Emphasise Maurrassisme"
NFA_emphasise_maurrasisme_desc:0 "With the new AF government in place, Charles Maurras can at last seek to implement his integral nationalist ideals. Rooted in the rational need for order and hierarchy to guide society, Maurrassian ideology is the only tangible solution to France's countless problems. By seizing the initiative and forcing through sweeping legislation, and promoting his political literature, Maurras can at last show the whole nation the light of his ideology."
NFA_anti_parliamentarisme:0 "Anti-Parliamentarisme"
NFA_anti_parliamentarisme_desc:0 "There can be no doubt as to what doomed the French nation in the Weltkrieg and subsequent revolution. It was the weakness and bickering of republican politicians, and the division between Frenchmen caused by multi-party democracy, which led to our fall. Such a pathetic political situation can continue no longer, and the error of Pétain's tolerance for the Assembly can finally be corrected. Having amassed the political capital to do so, the Maurras cabinet will put the Assembly in its place for good."
NFA_empower_the_camelots:0 "Empower the Camelots"
NFA_empower_the_camelots_desc:0 "The AF's paramilitary and youth group, the Camelots du Roi, has long been an invaluable asset of the party, dominating street fights against many unsavoury elements and teaching Maurrassian values to the French youth. Now that we have taken power, we can empower the Camelots within the government, granting them extensive powers and settling on a clearer purpose for the organisation."
NFA_classical_inspiration:0 "Classical Inspiration"
NFA_classical_inspiration_desc:0 "France is, fundamentally, a Latin and Mediterranean nation, and the roots of French civilisation are the Greek colonies on the southern coast of France and the Roman territories of Gaul. As such, the ideals and philosophy of the classical world must be the basis for French politics, and appreciation of the classics must be popularised in French culture. Long a proponent of classicism, Maurras intends to further popularise these ideals."
NFA_break_the_four_estates:0 "Break the Four Estates"
NFA_break_the_four_estates_desc:0 "Maurras has long identified the fundamental enemies of our civilisation, the anti-France, as being formed of "four confederate estates", namely Protestants, Jews, Freemasons, and immigrants, or, to use the ancient Athenian term, Metics. These four subversive elements have undermined France for centuries, spreading any number of insidious ideologies and enslaving the common Frenchman. It is time to finally break up their influence, if we are to ever have a chance of liberating France."
NFA_localist_ideals:0 "Localist Ideals"
NFA_localist_ideals_desc:0 "Vital to the Maurrassian ideology is an emphasis on localism and regional liberties. Although the circumstances of our exile makes it impossible for us to put this into practice, the government has resolved to form regional committees of supportive exiles, ready to assume the reigns of local administration when the time comes, and to lay the legislative groundwork for the decentralization of the State, which can be put into practice after the Liberation."
NFA_smash_global_finance:0 "Smash High Finance"
NFA_smash_global_finance_desc:0 "If France is to be truly independent, it must free itself from the shackles of rootless finance, with all its corruption, subversion, and Jewish influence. Even today, the bankers at the top are growing fat while decent Frenchmen toil in poverty. This can go on no longer, and it is time for the state to step in and break up corrupt foreign and Jewish businesses."
NFA_sacred_traditions:0 "The Necessity of Hierarchy"
NFA_sacred_traditions_desc:0 "In truth, modern ideals of democracy and liberalism amount to little more than a tyranny of finance and of mob rule, while socialist and most radical right-wing states are even less subtle in their tyranny. The only state that can grant the people genuine freedom is a traditionalist one, built on a natural hierarchy with the King at the top, using necessary authority to guide the people without devolving into petty tyranny. It is such a state that we must build in France."
NFA_work_with_abbas:0 "Work with Abbas"
NFA_work_with_abbas_desc:0 "For some years now, the AF has enjoyed the support and assistance of the Action Algerienne, an Algerian Arab party inspired by our own movement and ideology. Its leader, Ferhat Abbas, is a staunch admirer of Maurras, and is glad to accept an autonomous Algeria within the Kingdom of France. It is thus obvious that we should reach out to him and his party, integrating them into the government, to win favour among the Algerian population."
NFA_cultural_revivals_among_exiles:0 "French Traditions"
NFA_cultural_revivals_among_exiles_desc:0 "The many local cultures and traditions of France, from Brittany to Provence and Corsica to Normandy, are each beautiful and unique, and it is the duty of any truly French government to do its utmost to preserve each one. These traditions are under attack each day from the Communard tyrants, and it is down to us to liberate every distinct part of France from their grip. Promoting revivals of local culture among the exiles, and organising them based on their region of origin, will galvanise support for the liberation."
NFA_royal_corporatism:0 "Royal Corporatism"
NFA_royal_corporatism_desc:0 "The unrestrained capitalism of today is destructive to regional liberty and to traditional values, and it is vital that we take a stance against it. However, socialism is an equally negative system, and we must seek an alternative, reorganising the economy into state-controlled corporations. With the economy under state supervision, we will be able to proactively ready it for the liberation, and break what remains of foreign influence."
NFA_end_romanticism:0 "End Romanticism"
NFA_end_romanticism_desc:0 "One of the greatest evils of the 19th century was the growth of romanticism in art and literature. A deviant movement, an affront to tradition and to the high standards of the Classics, the spread of romanticism went hand in hand with that of liberalism, and we cannot truly free ourselves from one without freeing ourselves from the other. As such, the government must take action to promote true and time-honoured forms of art, infinitely superior to the degenerate movement of the last century."
NFA_support_native_elites:0 "Support Native Elites"
NFA_support_native_elites_desc:0 "The aid of local native rulers has always sustained French colonial rule in Africa. Now, however, this support gives us a perfect opportunity to put Maurras's localist principles into practice. By granting native rulers greater autonomy and self-rule, conditional of course on loyalty to France and contributions to the Liberation, we can perfect the practical means of decentralising the state, and strengthen native acceptance of colonial rule."
NFA_order_and_reason:0 "Order and Reason"
NFA_order_and_reason_desc:0 "Above all else, the state must maintain order and decency in society, and doing so necessitates the use of force. Force, however, is worthless and tyrannical without a higher reason and a higher purpose to guide it. In the integral nationalist doctrine of Maurras, we have that purpose, and in the Camelots du Roi and military we have the force. The Kingdom must be accepted by all good Frenchmen, and in exchange all good Frenchmen will enjoy rational and orderly governance."
NFA_mend_relations_with_the_holy_see:0 "Mend Relations with the Holy See"
NFA_mend_relations_with_the_holy_see_desc:0 "The last great barrier to Maurras's rule is the AF's estrangement from the Papacy and Holy See. Although the Church should be one of our greatest allies, and would normally be supportive of a traditionalist and counter-revolutionary monarchy, they have long been alienated by Maurras's own agnosticism, and his view of the Church as little more than a politically convenient force, as opposed to the Ministry of Christ. We must take measures to end this rift."
NFA_ancient_liberties:0 "Liberty Through Authority"
NFA_ancient_liberties_desc:0 "Although the creation of an authoritarian state is used all too frequently by tyrants, authority can exist perfectly well without tyranny, and indeed is needed to avoid tyranny. Only through the authoritarianism of the state can we keep at bay global finance, the Four Estates, socialism, and every other evil waiting to oppress the French people. Our authority alone is what guarantees genuine liberty."
NFA_the_kingdom_from_the_ashes:0 "The Kingdom Reborn"
NFA_the_kingdom_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "At last, after every trial and tribulation, the great Kingdom of France stands proud once again, confident in the justice of its system and the rightness of its purpose. United under His Majesty and Maurras's cabinet, with the military's loyalty assured, we stand ready to liberate our French brothers and sisters in the Commune, and to restore French greatness to the world. Vive la France, et vive le Roi!"
NFA_celebrate_joan_of_arc:0 "Celebrate Jeanne d'Arc"
NFA_celebrate_joan_of_arc_desc:0 "The symbol of the republic, Marianne, encapsulates everything wrong with that decrepit State. Depicted in filthy clothes and barely dressed, Marianne represents perfectly the poverty and decadence of Republican France. A preferable alternative to such a filthy idol is Jeanne d'Arc, French hero of the 100 Years' War and a revered saint. By popularising her heroics, we can promote the AF's values further."

NFA_the_colonel_at_the_helm:0 "De la Rocque at the Helm"
NFA_the_colonel_at_the_helm_desc:0 "In order to restore support for his presidency and for the military, Philippe Pétain has appointed Colonel François de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu, as his new Premier. As de la Rocque, despite his military past, is the first civilian premier since 1919, this marks a major step, and according to some, the beginning of the end of the junta. Either way, de la Rocque now has a free hand to implement his Catholic and corporatist policies across the nation."
NFA_defang_the_assembly:0 "Defang the Assembly"
NFA_defang_the_assembly_desc:0 "Parliamentary weakness and bickering has been a thorn in the side of the Republic for long enough. It was the division and chaos of parliamentary government that doomed us in the Great War and revolution, and it would be madness to suggest that Foch's coup in 1919 was anything but justified. As such, we must finally put a stop to the parliamentarism that divides us even today, concentrating power in the President, Premier, and cabinet."
NFA_military_alliances:0 "Military Cooperation"
NFA_military_alliances_desc:0 "De la Rocque is the first civilian to be appointed Premier since the coup in 1919, and understandably many officers are concerned that their political influence will come to an end. It is crucial that we assuage these fears, by meeting with prominent generals and explaining our shared values and goals, offering them government posts and reassuring them of our good intentions."
NFA_support_patriotic_industrialists:0 "Align Patriotic Industrialists"
NFA_support_patriotic_industrialists_desc:0 "Rightwing businessmen, socially conscious and nationalistic, have long been crucial supporters of the Croix-de-Feu, their funds working magic for the party's continued success. We should reward these good men with government positions and contracts, and thus further incentivise other wealthy businessmen to join their ranks."
NFA_strike_hidden_socialism:0 "Strike at Hidden Socialism"
NFA_strike_hidden_socialism_desc:0 "For years now, de la Rocque has warned the nation of "hidden socialism", a nefarious enemy within. Now that we are in power, we can finally begin investigating and stamping out socialist and Communard infiltration. The Deuxieme Bureau, a longstanding bastion of anti-socialism, will be given extended powers to detect and fight socialism, investigating opposition politicians and others who remain skeptical of the government."
NFA_bolster_the_mass_movement:0 "Bolster the Mass Movement"
NFA_bolster_the_mass_movement_desc:0 "The Croix-de-Feu has come a long way from its origins as a veterans' association, and, since being reformed into a political party in 1933, has gained a mess membership unprecedented for French parties, with its own newspapers, security services, and youth groups. If de la Rocque's regime is to prosper, we must further emphasise the party's populist appeal, and incentivise membership as a requirement for government positions and contracts."
NFA_republique_sociale:0 "République Sociale"
NFA_republique_sociale_desc:0 "With the Croix-de-Feu stronger than ever, and having gained the support of much of the establishment, de la Rocque can finally reform the failed Third Republic into a new République Sociale Française, creating a new French constitution along Catholic and corporatist lines, with the support of the Assmebly and military. Under the Colonel's guidance, France shall prosper like never before."
NFA_a_minimum_wage:0 "A Minimum Wage"
NFA_a_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Despite our good relations with business, we must never forget or ignore the struggles and sacrifices made by ordinary French workers. The working class makes up a substantial proportion of our membership, and any government has a duty, albeit one long neglected by the Republican establishment, to provide for the common man. As such, we should establish a fair and just minimum wage for all French workers, something which our corporate allies can quite easily afford."
NFA_catholic_state_unions:0 "Catholic State Unions"
NFA_catholic_state_unions_desc:0 "The free-market capitalism of previous governments was a divisive and unsustainable system, and only left the working class with much justified resentment, which was taken advantage of by socialists and erupted in the Revolution. We must take care to never let such resentment build up again. As such, the state will assume control of the remaining trade unions, and reorganise them into Catholic organisations, which can represent workers on company boards and ensure just treatment, while also promoting faith and patriotism among their members."
NFA_restore_the_place_of_the_church:0 "Restore the Place of the Church"
NFA_restore_the_place_of_the_church_desc:0 "Ever since 1905, the Republic has had no organised ties with the Catholic Church, and Catholicism in France has come under attack from Republican elites. Although the conservative policies of Pétain's government did go some way to restoring morality, much work remains to be done, and it is de la Rocque, champion of the Catholic middle class, who will do it. It is time to reach out to the Holy See, and sign a new Concordat with the Church."
NFA_bridge_class_divide:0 "Bridge the Class Divide"
NFA_bridge_class_divide_desc:0 "Class divisions and inequality have crippled our nation for too long, leaving hard-working workers embittered against France and vulnerable to leftist subversion, while their elites grow rootless and complacent. The time for such a disastrous state of affairs is no more, and through worker representation on company boards and state oversight of the market, a new era of class collaboration can set in, in which every man knows and accepts his place and purpose."
NFA_expand_the_dispos:0 "Expand the Dispos"
NFA_expand_the_dispos_desc:0 "The dispos have served as paramilitary and security service for the Croix-de-Feu for years now, asserting the party's presence on the streets and protecting our members, without devolving into the same violence and illegality as the AF's Camelots and other organisations. To protect the government and secure our position, we should further promote membership of the dispos among young men, and empower them to act against our rivals."
NFA_le_flambeau:0 "Le Flambeau"
NFA_le_flambeau_desc:0 "Le Flambeau has always been the newspaper of the Croix-de-Feu, and is popular among our membership. However, propaganda is of little use when read only by those who already support us. As such, we should invest more heavily in Le Flambeau, expanding its journalistic staff and increasing its circulation, to ensure our message reaches the whole population."
NFA_fils_et_filles:0 "Fils et Filles"
NFA_fils_et_filles_desc:0 "The Fils et Filles de Croix de Feu is the youth wing of our party, teaching the children of loyal members exercise, hard work, and faith. Our government will be greatly strengthened in the long term if we expand this organisation, and so we shall strongly encourage government officials, whatever their personal sympathies, to enroll their children in the movement, and greatly increase the organisation's funding."
NFA_votes_for_women:0 "Votes for Women"
NFA_votes_for_women_desc:0 "Female suffrage has long been championed by parties across the French right, with women held to be modest and conscientious enough to likely vote en masse for conservative parties. In order to strengthen the party's hand and further legitimise future electoral successes, we should extend the franchise to women, and meanwhile extend the Croix-de-Feu's own women's organisations, to galvanise support among the new voter bloc."
NFA_legalist_state:0 "Legalist State"
NFA_legalist_state_desc:0 "The duty of the state, above all else, is to maintain social order and the rule of law, keeping all its citizens safe and free. A state which cannot do this is a failed state, and we must not forget it. By further putting into law the emerging corporatist system, and expanding the police, we can maintain capable and orderly governance to prepare France for the liberation."
NFA_encourage_personality_cult:0 "Encourage the Cult of Personality"
NFA_encourage_personality_cult_desc:0 "Colonel de la Rocque's charisma and popularity has caused him to become deeply popular among his committed followers, with his portrait becoming a common sight in the homes and workplaces of Croix-de-Feu loyalists. To further consolidate our government and promote de la Rocque' public image, we should encourage this cult of personality, celebrating his heroism in the Great War and commitment to France."
NFA_entrench_corporatism:0 "Entrench Corporatism"
NFA_entrench_corporatism_desc:0 "With unions brought under state control and represented in government, and with the state brokering positive relations between employers and workers, a new corporate state has finally taken hold in France. We should further formalise this state of affairs with a new corporate charter, signed by business leaders and unionists and passed into law, to ensure that all cooperate for the common good under state supervision."
NFA_social_dabord:0 "Social d'Abord!"
NFA_social_dabord_desc:0 "With corporatism successfully established, and the mass movement of the Croix-de-Feu stronger than ever, Colonel de la Rocque has successfully transformed French politics.

With preparations for a restoration well underway, the whole nation can rejoice, for true and ancient governance is about to return."

NFA_compromise_with_the_liberals:0 "A Republican Cabinet"
NFA_compromise_with_the_liberals_desc:0 "With the inevitable corruption and waste of his junta having become undeniable public knowledge, Phillipe Pétain has caved to the pressure of his allies in the Assembly and of much of the business community, and appointed Louis Marin, leader of the Catholic and conservative but thoroughly republican FR, as his new Premier. Marin makes no secret of his intention to restore a civilian-led Republican government, but many believe that this will be an uphill struggle."
NFA_republican_govt:0 "Form a Unity Government"
NFA_republican_govt_desc:0 "For now, Marin is merely Premier of Pétain's "Provisional Military Government", and in spite of his goals of republicanisation, the junta is, for now, intact. Of course, this must change, and so Marin must now sit down with the other Republican parties, in spite of all their past differences, and attempt to form a new broad coalition government, capable of restoring Republican institutions and constitutional integrity in anticipation of the Liberation."
NFA_restore_assembly_power:0 "Strengthen the Assembly"
NFA_restore_assembly_power_desc:0 "Ever since 1919, National France has been little more than a Presidential dictatorship under Foch and Pétain. Now, however, we can begin to change this, and restore the legislature to its rightful place as the dominant branch of government. New legislation, made possible by the Republican parties' renewed cooperation, will strengthen the hand of the Assembly, and restore checks and balances on executive power."
NFA_reassure_the_military:0 "Reassure the Military"
NFA_reassure_the_military_desc:0 "Although we are working to break the military's grip on political power, we nevertheless need their support for the government to stay intact and for there to be any hope of a successful liberation. As such, we have little choice but to reach out to the military command, and placate their fears about democratisation, while offering the concessions needed to bring them around to the government."
NFA_constitutional_security:0 "Constitutional Guarantees"
NFA_constitutional_security_desc:0 "Neither Pétain nor Foch ever formally suspended the Third Republic's constitution, but it is obvious that their junta has defied all of its democratic principles. It is thus vital to reinforce the checks on executive power and free speech enshrined in the constitution, and push through further legislation in support of the same ideals of liberty."
NFA_republican_traditions:0 "Republican Traditions"
NFA_republican_traditions_desc:0 "Since 1789, French republicanism has gained its own distinct aesthetic and philosophical identity, with many historic celebrations and civic rituals attached to the Republic. In order to restore faith in the parliamentary system, we must breathe new life into the Republican ideal, promoting the romantic art celebrating Republican history and rejuvenating its rituals and ceremonial duties of the Republic's leaders."
NFA_ceremonial_presidency:0 "A Ceremonial Presidency"
NFA_ceremonial_presidency_desc:0 "Ever since Foch seized power in 1919, the executive branch has had a tight grip on French politics, with the legislature and judiciary greatly sidelined. Now, however, with the unity government entrenched and Pétain having largely accepted the Assembly's control over ordinary governance, we can further reduce the role of the President to a ceremonial figurehead, a role for which the popular war hero Pétain is excellent, with his prestige sure to further bolster our support."
NFA_judicial_independence:0 "Judicial Independence"
NFA_judicial_independence_desc:0 "Under the junta, the legal system was frequently used to unjustly persecute the military's political enemies, and courts were frequently intimidated to make rulings favourable to the political circumstances of the regime. This is not healthy or sustainable for a democratic republic, and so we must further enshrine the independence of the judicial branch in law, and reinforce respect for the constitutional clauses intended to provide for it."

NFA_free_petain_prisoners_desc:0 "Over the 17 years it was in power, the junta unjustly arrested many of its political opponents, in spite of their obvious anti-socialism, proven by the fact that they too chose to flee to Algeria. Staunch supporters of democracy, these men are excellent politicians and administrators in waiting for our government, and, having reinforced the independence of the judiciary, we should set about revoking their sentences."
NFA_legislative_empowerment:0 "Parliamentary Empowerment"
NFA_legislative_empowerment_desc:0 "With our economic reforms implemented and Pétain, albeit reluctantly, having accepted a largely ceremonial role as a unifying figurehead for the government and nation, we can now go a step further, and consolidate power in the Assembly, exercised through the Premier and cabinet. The French Republic will be a parliamentary republic, or it will be no republic at all."
NFA_monetary_reform:0 "Devalue the Franc"
NFA_monetary_reform_desc:0 "Pétain's junta was all too frequently negligent of the economy, at least so long as it was keeping them supplied with armaments. Of course, this is thoroughly unsustainable, and only a determined program of monetary and financial reform can create an economy capable of fuelling liberation. There is much debate within the coalition about how to reform the economy, but all sides agree that the Franc must be devalued, and so we can start our reforms on this note."
NFA_reynaud_plan:0 "Plan Reynaud"
NFA_reynaud_plan_desc:0 "Premier Marin has accepted the economic proposals of Paul Reynaud of the Alliance Démocrate. A staunch believer in deregulation and the free market, Reynaud advocates privatisation, cutting out red tape, and strengthening ties with big business as a vital step to get the economy into shape. We can begin to implement these proposals by returning to the free market the industries which Pétain's junta has attempted to manage or supervise."
NFA_end_fourty_hour_week:0 "End the Forty-Hour Week"
NFA_end_fourty_hour_week_desc:0 "Excessive regulation and intervention in the market will only stifle the private talent and initiative that we need in order to liberate France, something which the business community has sought to warn of for years now. Some of the red tape that business is most opposed to is the legal maximum of forty hours of work a week, a law that the AD has sought to repeal for some time. With the blessing of Marin and the FR, Reynaud and his allies can finally do away with this worthless legislation."
NFA_free_market:0 "Encourage Private Initiative"
NFA_free_market_desc:0 "It is the initiative and dynamism of the free market, not any amount of incompetent and heavy-handed state intervention, that will get our economy into a fit state for the liberation and enrich the nation. It is time for the state to further step back from economic intervention, ensuring big business's support for democratisation, and also taking more steps to promote values of entrepreneurship and hard work."
NFA_chautemps_plan:0 "Plan Chautemps"
NFA_chautemps_plan_desc:0 "Premier Marin has accepted the economic proposals of Camille Chautemps of the Parti Radical. Coming from a historically left-wing party, which at least formally still claims socialist credentials, Chautemps advocates for the representation of workers and for a welfare state, alongside increased state intervention. We can begin to implement these plans by greatly increasing government spending on social welfare, and widening the net for those who can receive it."
NFA_nationalise_infrastructure:0 "Nationalise Infrastructure"
NFA_nationalise_infrastructure_desc:0 "We cannot allow the narrow interests of a few wealthy businessmen to obstruct the national interest at this vital time, when we absolutely need high-quality infrastructure to connect our sprawling colonies, in order to stimulate the mobilisation and war effort. As such, as per Chautemps's proposals, the state will assume control over ongoing infrastructure projects, and ownership of the roads and railways that currently link together the colonies."
NFA_worker_representation:0 "Worker Representation"
NFA_worker_representation_desc:0 "The revolution happened because the ordinary French worker was allowed to feel powerless, exploited, and betrayed. If we are to organize a successful liberation campaign, let alone to regain the loyalty of ordinary Frenchmen, we must enshrine the representation of workers through trusted trade unions, whose representatives will take places on company boards. This will create a successful spirit of collaboration between social classes, reducing class tensions and also reducing the support for right-wing corporatists."
NFA_economic_mobilisation:0 "Economic Mobilisation"
NFA_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "The main part of our economic reforms have now been pushed through, and so we can turn our attention to the coming war, expanding on our financial initiatives to ready the economy for war. Increased subsidies for arms production and propaganda reminding businessmen of the current war and the need for patriotism will ensure that the business community is prepared for the coming conflict."
NFA_republican_restoration:0 "Republican Rejuvenation"
NFA_republican_restoration_desc:0 "With Pétain haven given up his old dictatorial powers and the parties of the Republic having deepened their spirit of cooperation, popular confidence in democracy and Republicanism is steadily returning, with Marin increasingly seen as a benevolent elder statesman and Pétain's own popularity also helping round up support support for the coalition. The ideals of the Third Republic truly have been rejuvenated, and Marin's government has succeeded in its mission to restore Parliamentarism."
NFA_relax_censorship:0 "Relax Censorship"
NFA_relax_censorship_desc:0 "Under the junta, the press was routinely muzzled in its political coverage and stances, and more often bought off to print favourable stories. Harsh censorship laws are still in place, supposedly on the pretext of the State of Emergency, and these are thoroughly incompatible with our moves towards democratisation. It is time we repeal these measures, and restore freedom to the press and the ordinary man."
NFA_cleanse_corruption:0 "Clean Up Corruption"
NFA_cleanse_corruption_desc:0 "During the junta's grip on politics, many personal friends or family members of government officials got easy access to government posts or subsidies, and more often than not blatant and obviously criminal practices such as bribery and extortion would be practiced by unscrupulous administrators. We must take measures to investigate and bring to justice these undesirable men, and send a clear message that only merit will bring success in the new government."
NFA_government_of_consensus:0 "A Government of Consensus"
NFA_government_of_consensus_desc:0 "After much time, we have finally succeeded in ending military rule, economic stagnation, and corruption in National France. In spite of their many evident differences, the Republican parties have embraced the spirit of consensus and cooperation, and Pétain's own popularity has done much to buoy our support. We have democratised as much as we can within the colonies, and stand ready to bring true liberty to our brothers across the Mediterranean. Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, pour toujours!"

NFA_liberation_preparation:0 "Prepare for the Liberation"
NFA_liberation_preparation_desc:0 "The situation in Continental Europe is quickly becoming more and more tense, with elections imminent among the Communard traitors, whose relations with the Germans are more tense than ever. There is no point in denying that a conflict even worse than the horrors of the Great War is around the corner, and that conflict will be the only chance we ever get to liberate the Métropole from syndicalist tyranny. As such, we must review our military capabilities, and seek to resolve debates within the Army."
NFA_industrialise_colonies:0 "Industrialise the Colonies"
NFA_industrialise_colonies_desc:0 "Our current industry could never hope to sustain a military campaign across the Métropole. If we are to have any hope of liberating our brothers and sisters, we must rectify this dire situation, and seek to encourage a far greater level of industrial growth across the colonies. Subsidies for new construction projects in both the Maghreb and Sub-Saharan territories will begin to get our industrial capacity back on track."
NFA_entente_trade:0 "Entente Trade Deals"
NFA_entente_trade_desc:0 "The chaos of the revolution and exile left us with precious few allies compared to the vast coalition that had challenged Germany during the Great War. However, we must consolidate our ties with those allies that we do have, and reach out to our fellow Entente nations for increased economic co-operation, with mutually beneficial trade deals and investment, alongside a fresh effort to attract investment from these countries."
NFA_dockyards:0 "Maghrebi Shipbuilding"
NFA_dockyards_desc:0 "Without a strong and well-equipped navy, we have no hope of liberating France, and as such we badly need ships. With this in mind, the government should subsidize shipbuilding on the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa, and invest further in naval research."
NFA_rearmament:0 "National Rearmament Program"
NFA_rearmament_desc:0 "Our need for military industry is greater than ever, and as such it is now vital that we redouble our investments in arms factories and subsidies for armaments, encouraging both private business and state interests to do their bit for the military economy, and introducing greater rationing in order to save resources for the military."
NFA_plane_subsidies:0 "Subsidise Plane Production"
NFA_plane_subsidies_desc:0 "The Communard forces far outnumber our own, and as such we will need domination of the skies in order to push them back, and also to protect our Mediterranean supply lines. As such, we should greatly extend our subsidies for planes, making a great effort to encourage manufacturers to produce higher quantities of the latest models."
NFA_supply_liberation:0 "Supplying the Liberation"
NFA_supply_liberation_desc:0 "As we push further into the Commune, we will only need more and more equipment to sustain the Liberation Campaign. Hence, the state must go ever further in its investments in the army, securing the safety of our forces' supply lines and the quality and quantity of their equipment. No matter how tightly the economy has already been squeezed, more is always needed."
NFA_build_transsaharian:0 "The Trans-Saharan Railway"
NFA_build_transsaharian_desc:0 "The German takeover of Morocco has left our remaining West African colonies largely cut off from Algiers by the Sahara. This causes an inefficient administration, and if we are ever invaded it will lead to severe supply issues for our soldiers, particularly if we can no longer safely travel around the coast. As such, we must begin the construction of a new railway across the desert."
NFA_colonial_extraction:0 "Colonial Extraction"
NFA_colonial_extraction_desc:0 "Our colonies contain a vast amount of natural wealth, which has so far gone largely untapped. However, we need trade and investment more than ever, and as such it is now vital that we look to developing and extracting these valuable resources."
NFA_extent_of_conscription:0 "The Extent of Conscription"
NFA_extent_of_conscription_desc:0 "For years now, the government has shied away from the question of how far we should go in conscripting natives for military service, hesitant to alter the status quo in either direction to avoid controversy. However, the hour of the liberation is fast approaching, and many would now like to see the matter settled for good."
NFA_native_autonomy:0 "Expand Native Autonomy"
NFA_native_autonomy_desc:0 "With the AF now firmly in power, we can expand on our alliances with far-right native parties such as the Action Algerienne, and ensure the loyalty of traditional native rulers, by giving greater local autonomy to colonial regions, empowering local monarchs and integralist politicians with much control over day-to-day governance of their own lands."
NFA_status_quo:0 "Colonial Status Quo"
NFA_status_quo_desc:0 "In spite of the complaints from many corners of society, the existing system in our colonies genuinely does work, and is only beneficial to us. As such, we should discredit the groups calling for either liberalised or harsher colonial policies, and affirm our support for the Civilising Mission, by further funding Missionaries and reinforcing colonial outposts in the more remote territories."
NFA_colonial_crackdown:0 "Renewed Crackdown"
NFA_colonial_crackdown_desc:0 "The threat posed to our colonial empire, the only land that the true French government has left, is by now too great to ignore. Seditious individuals from across the political spectrum, both native and French, routinely call for reforms to colonial rule, but it is quite the opposite that we need. New waves of arrests, and the establishment of a formal colonial secret police, will eliminate threats to our continued domination."
NFA_french_union:0 "French Union"
NFA_french_union_desc:0 "With the Métropole liberated, the centre of French administration is now across the sea from the colonies. This has caused much administrative chaos, as the colonial administrations seek to get back onto their own two feet, and only new reforms to the colonial system can remedy this. A new "French Union" in which the colonies are nominally equal partners in a united French state will solve this, and appease native demands for self rule."
NFA_pacify_algeria:0 "Reassert French Rule"
NFA_pacify_algeria_desc:0 "Now that the central government resides once more in the métropole, many colonials feel even more cut off from power than before, and are pressing for greater independence, while the relocation of the central administration has lessened our ability to keep independence movements suppressed. The only remedy to this is to authorise new crackdowns against native organisations and nationalist groups, and to send more troops to reinforce colonial garrisons."
NFA_cdg_plan_chosen:0 "The de Gaulle Plan"
NFA_cdg_plan_chosen_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain has accepted Charles de Gaulle's proposals for military reform, with de Gaulle having been appointed as the new Chief of Staff. The French military will now set about implementing de Gaulle's reform plan, centered around the ideal of a small but heavily capable army, with high quality training and equipment, and also concentrated breakthroughs by armoured units."
NFA_elite_army:0 "A Professional Army"
NFA_elite_army_desc:0 "General de Gaulle has long argued that, given the circumstances of our exile, it would be pointless to attempt to raise a large army, and we must instead make the most of what manpower we have. By cutting manpower quotas for the army while shifting funds from recruitment to training, we can create a small but highly professional and well-trained army."
NFA_special_forces:0 "Expand Special Forces"
NFA_special_forces_desc:0 "A major aspect of professionalising the army is a shift towards specialised, elite units, such as marines and mountaineers. Different units will receive in-depth specialised training, in order to be exceptionally well-suited for specific operations and circumstances. Meanwhile, the establishment of a new Marine program will help our efforts to land in the Métropole, and reduce the influence of the Navy."
NFA_mobile_warfare:0 "Embrace Manoeuvre Warfare"
NFA_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Himself a tank officer, de Gaulle has claimed for years that tanks represent the future of warfare, with the breakthroughs they achieved during the Great War, particularly at the Somme, demonstrating their ability to rapidly smash through enemy lines before the enemy can form a clear response. With tank technology having greatly improved since then, we can expand our armoured units and increase our investments in tank production."
NFA_tank_investments:0 "Chars de Bataille"
NFA_tank_investments_desc:0 "Although strong armoured units are essential to de Gaulle's vision, our own technology and production capacity falls far short of what would be needed to sustain the tank divisions envisaged by the Chief of Staff. As such, we shall redirect funding away from the navy and from recruitment campaigns to support new Research and Development for tanks, and increase subsidies for their production."
NFA_artillery_improvements:0 "Artillery Improvements"
NFA_artillery_improvements_desc:0 "Although tanks are central to de Gaulle's plan, they can only be in one place at one time, and as such capable infantry units are needed to cover a broader front. The Great War showed that strong artillery is the only way to prevent infantry from being bogged down in attrition, and thus we shall expand our artillery units and further develop tactics for the shelling of enemy forces."
NFA_concentrated_breakthrough:0 "Rapid Breakthroughs"
NFA_concentrated_breakthrough_desc:0 "If tank units can punch through enemy lines quickly enough, it is essential that they keep going as far as they can, to quickly secure strategic locations and throw enemy forces into chaos. Our newly expanded armoured units will thus be trained in rapidly breaking past enemy defences, and tank commanders will be instructed in how best to exploit holes in enemy lines."
NFA_officer_autonomy:0 "Strengthen Officer Autonomy"
NFA_officer_autonomy_desc:0 "Provided that he is capable and well-trained, the officer on the ground will be the best judge of how to act in battle, as the failures of Generals away in their Chateaux during the Great War proved. As such, we should ensure that our officers are highly capable and can be trusted to take dynamic action, and empower them to do just that."
NFA_air_support:0 "Air Support"
NFA_air_support_desc:0 "A large air force is needed in order to disrupt enemy supply lines and break up enemy units, something that will greatly assist our armoured breakthroughs. As such, de Gaulle has authorised new funds for the Air Force, which will be encouraged to focus on Close Air Support and dive-bombing tactics, and supported by de Gaulle in exchange for distancing itself from Darlan and the navy."
NFA_armour_advancements:0 "Armour Advancements"
NFA_armour_advancements_desc:0 "Our current tank models continue to fall far behind those needed for de Gaulle's swift offensives, and although his theories are widely accepted, many officers still lack the experience to command tanks in battle. Thus, we shall invest further in the development of new tank models, and give far more officers extensive training in armoured warfare."
NFA_subordinate_navy:0 "Subordinate the Navy"
NFA_subordinate_navy_desc:0 "In the current circumstances, we have little need for a colossal navy capable of dominating large oceans, when all we need is to be able to cross the Mediterranean sea. So far, however, the navy has refused to acknowledge this, with Admiral Darnand still demanding needless funds for his worthless projects. It is time to put the navy in its place, and ensure that it cannot act without the approval of the Chief of Staff."
NFA_darlan_plan_chosen:0 "The Darlan Plan"
NFA_darlan_plan_chosen_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain has accepted François Darlan's proposals for military reform, with Darlan having been appointed as the new Chief of Staff. The French military will now set about implementing Darlan's reform plan, centred around the ideal of as large an army as circumstances allow, within an integrated command structure that allows for greater cooperation between forces."
NFA_military_research:0 "Military Research"
NFA_military_research_desc:0 "Our current Research and Development capabilities are severely lacking, and we need to greatly expand funding for research facilities in order to develop the military technology required for a modern army. We can put off resolving this issue for no longer, and it is time to greatly increase funding for military research."
NFA_large_army:0 "A Large Army"
NFA_large_army_desc:0 "Darlan and Weygand believe strongly that the only way we can truly ensure a strong enough military is to embrace the traditional French doctrine of an expansive army, capable of covering, and pushing across, a broad front. As such, the General Staff has organised new recruitment campaigns among white Frenchmen, and an effort to persuade those Frenchmen who have fled to other countries to come here and do their duty as well."
NFA_contact_resistance:0 "Expand Resistance Contacts"
NFA_contact_resistance_desc:0 "Within the Métropole, the Communards are still far from unanimously accepted, especially in traditionally Catholic rural areas. Sizeable resistance movements still persist in parts of the Commune, and although we have always tried to support them it has so far proved insufficient to make much difference to their plight. Now, however, Darlan has committed to deepen our backing of these valiant men, ordering numerous more agents to be sent to the Commune, who can coordinate the operations of Resistance Groups and ensure they answer to Algiers."
NFA_force_cooperation:0 "Force Co-Operation"
NFA_force_cooperation_desc:0 "Without a strong navy and airforce, we have no hope of ever crossing the Mediterranean, let alone of maintaining the pressure on Communard supply lines that would be needed to defeat them. As such, Darlan and Weygand have committed to further integrate the commands of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, ensuring that the French military is one united and cohesive force, and reigning in ambitious generals such as de Gaulle."
NFA_coordinate_operations:0 "Coordinate Operations"
NFA_coordinate_operations_desc:0 "Without the three branches of the military acting in unison, we have little hope of managing a well-organised campaign. As such, the Officer Corps of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will be integrated together, and we shall ensure that officers from one branch must consult with their counterparts from the others, and arrange any necessary supporting operations, before making new plans."
NFA_naval_influence:0 "Strengthen the Navy"
NFA_naval_influence_desc:0 "If anything, the Navy is the force we need the most in our current situation, as without it we have no hope of even landing in the Commune. Darlan, himself an Admiral, knows this all too well, with many of his loyalists also coming from the Navy. As such, it is vital that we increase funding for the Navy and increase the representation of naval officers in the General Staff."
NFA_air_power:0 "Rule the Skies"
NFA_air_power_desc:0 "A strong Air Force is absolutely vital, in order to both cover our fleets in the Mediterranean and support soldiers in the Métropole. Thus it is vital that we further extend our investments in the Air Force, subsidising Research and Development of planes and promising its chief officers continued backing in exchange for supporting Darlan."
NFA_patriotic_appeals:0 "Patriotic Appeals"
NFA_patriotic_appeals_desc:0 "As we seek to attract more recruits for Darlan's envisaged larger army, it is vital that we appeal to the common patriotism of every decent Frenchman, reminding the people at every opportunity that their French brothers and sisters are subjected to socialist tyranny, with their faith and culture suppressed. Only a new crusade to free France can change this, one which requires the commitment of every citizen."
NFA_broad_offensives:0 "Broad Offensives"
NFA_broad_offensives_desc:0 "Only by pushing across a large front can we maintain pressure on the Communards, something we can do better than ever with our wealth of new recruitments. We must ensure that our infantry forces understand what is needed to maintain a large offensive, and that our officers are well-trained in commanding such operations."
NFA_citizen_soldier:0 "Citizen-Soldier Ideal"
NFA_citizen_soldier_desc:0 "For centuries, the tradition of the Citizen-Soldier, the common Frenchman called to war in times of need, has been crucial to our military prowess. This ideal underpins Darlan's expansion of troop numbers, and we should further reinforce it through mandatory infantry training for all able-bodied adult men, so that if needed they can be called to serve their nation in its hour of need."
NFA_dominate_mediterranean:0 "Dominate the Mediterranean"
NFA_dominate_mediterranean_desc:0 "Without mastery of the Mediterranean, any effort to transport forces to the shores of the Métropole would be entirely futile. Furthermore, if we can achieve genuine naval control over the sea, we can secure new trade routes while disrupting Communard supplies, and garner new prestige within the region. As such, it is crucial that we invest further in shipbuilding and naval research."

NFA_Ministry_of_the_Air:0 "Ministry of the Air"
NFA_Ministry_of_the_Air_desc:0 "The Ministry of the Air is tasked with both organising our aeronautical efforts, such as civilian air transport, and our air forces, which proved so useful in the Great War and which according to our military thinkers will prove even more critical in the coming war, as technological progress enables new air tactics and strategy."
NFA_Total_Air_War:0 "Total Air War"
NFA_Total_Air_War_desc:0 "Many of the younger generation of officers argue for large scale use of air support for the infantry, but others have also suggested that we should not shy away from using our air force to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry in a more generalised manner: we are not in a position to avoid total war, and turning the enemies' ressources to rubble can only help us."
NFA_Air_Coordination_Center:0 "Air Coordination Center"
NFA_Air_Coordination_Center_desc:0 "We will create a dedicated command center for our air forces, so that they are best assigned according to their strength and weaknesses instead of letting them be potentially misused by commanders with less experience of air tactics, and to ensure that the status of our forces in the air be monitored and controlled as best as possible, for example to mount rescue missions."
NFA_DEM_Barrage:0 "D.E.M Barrage"
NFA_DEM_Barrage_desc:0 "To coordinate offensive and defensive efforts in the air, the ministry will generalise the use of Electromagnetic Detection, immense antennas placed in strategic points using electromagnetic waves to detect aircrafts."
NFA_DCA_Network:0 "DCA Network"
NFA_DCA_Network_desc:0 "To prevent any air forces from attacking us on our own soil, particularly in Corsica so close to the red mainland, we will develop a network of anti-aircraft artillery batteries and searchlights,  highly coordinated by the Ministry of the Air."
NFA_Aircraft_Production:0 "Aircraft Production"
NFA_Aircraft_Production_desc:0 "The aircraft industry exploded during the Weltkrieg, and the government has made sure to generously subsidize it to facilitate its implementation in Algeria. Since then preparations for the next war have not stopped, especially since colonial conflicts have given us the opportunity to test our aircrafts. With war finally on the horizon, we will mobilise the industry to the fullest."
NFA_Long_Range_Fighter:0 "Long Range Fighter"
NFA_Long_Range_Fighter_desc:0 "Corsica might be a floating airfield from which our planes can easily reach the mainland, but we nevertheless need fighters capable of patrolling the vast expanses of the Mediterreanean as well as escort our bombers deep into red territory to destroy the Commune’s industry. The Ministry will ensure that the development of heavy fighters is not neglected."
NFA_Tactical_Bombers:0 "Tactical Bombers"
NFA_Tactical_Bombers_desc:0 "Our military thinkers have realised the importance of coordinated air-land efforts, with infantry heavily supported by tactical air support, against defensive structures, enemy personnel or infrastructure. To implement these tactics, the Ministry of the Air will support the development of tactical bombers."
NFA_Transmitting_Knowledge:0 "Transmitting Knowledge"
NFA_Transmitting_Knowledge_desc:0 "France has a proud history in aeronautics, and the Weltkrieg produced many heroes of the air. But you can’t learn to fly on the ground, and pilots are a rare commodity: we’ll ensure our best aces become even better instructors and teach a younger generation how to exceed them."
NFA_New_Air_Tactics:0 "New Air Tactics"
NFA_New_Air_Tactics_desc:0 "The field of military aviation is a rapidly changing one, and our pilots must adapt their skills to ever changing technology: with new aircrafts come new possibilities of offensive and defensive manoeuvres, new ways of coming out of a tense dogfight: extensive training in these new tactical advances will give an edge over our enemies."
NFA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs:0 "Ministry of Naval Affairs"
NFA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs_desc:0 "The Ministry of Naval Affairs, once tasked with overseeing the administration of both our colonies and our naval forces, is now solely dedicated to the needs of the Navy: control of Mediterranean will be essential to retake the Métropole, as such the ministry will make sure that our navy can stand up to the Internationale."
NFA_A_World_Class_Navy:0 "A World-Class Navy"
NFA_A_World_Class_Navy_desc:0 "Most of the French navy accompanied our government in exile to North Africa, as such our navy is large but many of our ships are outdated. In its current state the navy could defend our shores, but it is uncertain how it would fare if someone were to attempt to contest our hold on the Western Mediterranean. We will strive for a large-scale overhaul."
NFA_An_African_Toulon:0 "An African Toulon"
NFA_An_African_Toulon_desc:0 "Toulon was the primary base of the Mediterranean fleet before the war, but since the exile it has been stationed on lake Bizerte, a large laguna in northern Tunisia intensively developed by colonial authorities, with in particular a large arsenal in Ferryville. To meet our ambitions, Bizerte will be overhauled and developed further."
NFA_Heavy_Destroyers:0 "Heavy Destroyers"
NFA_Heavy_Destroyers_desc:0 "France’s navy has always been developed with the assumption that it would fight a superior force. In the last century, a movement called the “Jeune École” advocated for the use of many smaller ships instead of large dreadnoughts: this idea is now outdated. The ministry will instead encourage the development of well-armed destroyers, a middle ground between our traditional doctrines and international trends."
NFA_Aviation_Cruisers:0 "Aviation Cruisers"
NFA_Aviation_Cruisers_desc:0 "The field of naval aviation has been somewhat left behind by the international community, locked in a permanent arms race: this is a race we could not win, instead we will radically change our doctrine and encourage the use of air power in naval warfare, for reconnaissance and precision strikes."
NFA_Sea_Leviathans:0 "Sea Leviathans"
NFA_Sea_Leviathans_desc:0 "We might not be able to compete with Germany or Japan in the naval arms race, but we certainly can attempt to knock out any of our Mediterranean opponents with well armed heavy battleships: this might go against previous doctrines, but our current situation means it is time for some innovation."
NFA_Air_Carriers:0 "Air Carriers"
NFA_Air_Carriers_desc:0 "The current naval arms race is misguided: by developing aircraft carriers, we will ensure that we can keep control over the Meditterean by bombing our enemies and sinking them to the depths of the sea before we are even within range of their guns."
NFA_Preparing_Our_Return:0 "Preparing Our Return"
NFA_Preparing_Our_Return_desc:0 "To reconquer the métropole, we need to land on its shore, a fight that the Commune has been expecting for two decennies: it will be anything but simple. We must prepare as much as we can, as there will be no second chance. The Ministry will invest in the development of anything that could help our amphibious assault."
NFA_Invasion_Logistics:0 "Invasion Logistics"
NFA_Invasion_Logistics_desc:0 "However, the amphibious assault is merely the first part, we must ensure that our troops can secure a lasting bridgehead. And for this, there is only one way to prepare: impeccable logistics, so that the men lucky enough to be the first to set foot on the sacred soil of the Patrie can hold back any counterattack the Communards might attempt."
NFA_The_U_Boat_Menace:0 "Develop the Forces Sous-Marines"
NFA_The_U_Boat_Menace_desc:0 "The Commune lacks many resources essential to the modern war effort, most importantly, oil. Keeping control of the Mediterranean will be a strong step towards isolating them from their allies or neutral states willing to trade with them, but a large fleet of submarines will give us the capacity to harass their convoys even more efficiently."
NFA_Battaile_Escadres:0 "Bataille d'Escadres"
NFA_Battaile_Escadres_desc:0 "The battle for the Mediterranean won’t be won with a single engagement, and we need to think strategically. By creating task forces, we will ensure our ships have clear roles and that they will be easily more coordinated, and our naval commanders will be taught how to think on a larger scale."

NFA_cull_freemasonary:0 "Cull Freemasonry"
NFA_cull_freemasonary_desc:0 "The pagan secret society that is Freemasonry has long sought to infiltrate French institutions and abuse them for their own designs, fatally weakening us during both the war and the Revolution. Now we can take back what is ours by removing enemies of the French Legion associated with the Freemason movement before they strike us."
NFA_voice_of_the_militia:0 "Voice of the Militia"
NFA_voice_of_the_militia_desc:0 "The French Militias require both more recruits and more devotion.

NFA_dominate_capitalism:0 "Dominate Capitalism"
NFA_dominate_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalist internationalism, materialism and greed have long sought to subvert our nation, our faith and our unity. While their businesses already rely on state protection we will directly manage all international finance and trade, only approving of that which is required for the invasion of the Commune, while directly managing industries that will now have Legion members overseeing capitalist owners directly."
NFA_army_merger:0 "Army Merger"
NFA_army_merger_desc:0 "Between The Legionary Order Service, La Cagoule, The French Legion of Veterans, Anti-Syndicalist Action, Croix-de-Feu and too many others to name there are simply too many paramilitias attempting to coordinate with one another and now with the Army of National France as well. They and the army shall all be merged into one as commanders from each League are brought to heel under Darnand, organized as a single cohesive unit simply called the French Militia, with Commanders promised prominence after the Liberation for their loyalty. Only some organizations will remain semi-independent but underneath the Milice for internal security purposes, such as Darnand's Knights of the Sword."
NFA_ideal_of_youth:0 "Ideal of Youth"
NFA_ideal_of_youth_desc:0 "Strength. Vitality. Action. The positive attributes of youth are not to be understated, and as such Militia Schooling with an emphasis on recruiting young men and upholding the ideal of physical fitness shall be implemented at once."
NFA_ultranational_catholicism:0 "Ultranational Catholicism"
NFA_ultranational_catholicism_desc:0 "The values of France are those of an uncompromising Christian faith that warriors do not shy away from if they are to wage a war on the chaos and radical materialism destroying this earth. We must embrace our own national Catholicism and the French Race as incontrovertibly linked, promoting Legion friendly priests within the Church and demanding an endorsement of our values from the Papacy alongside according funds. They MUST denounce those supposed Christians who helped destroy true Catholicism in France such as the liberal Austrian scum who must now be called into a Crusade against our foes unless they wish to be destroyed next."
NFA_french_purity:0 "French Purity"
NFA_french_purity_desc:0 "France is not simply a place but a people, a people resulting from thousands of years of blood and tradition. This can not be forgotten as French blood purity will be rewarded and promoted within society and those who subvert it such as Jews and 'natives' and worst of them all, those who breed with foreigners, will be treated accordingly."
NFA_underworld_connections:0 "Underworld Connections"
NFA_underworld_connections_desc:0 "In Nice and Corsica there remain members of the Milieu who oppose the syndicalist revolution and who remain on good terms with Darnand's Legion. The Praetorians will tighten connections with them for men, supplies and most importantly information."
NFA_knightly_rituals:0 "Knightly Rituals"
NFA_knightly_rituals_desc:0 "We are the French Knights of old reborn, sent to make France whole again, as we should act as such. Tightly regulated knightly rituals, ceremonies and initiation rituals will increase our prestige and loyalty from loyal soldiers."
NFA_legionary_outreach:0 "Legionary Outreach"
NFA_legionary_outreach_desc:0 "We are not alone in desiring a world free of madness and a return to spiritualism and a rightfully earned warrior hierarchy despite our current disagreement over the details. Both Evola and the Iron Guard have endorsed our 'Esoteric' and traditionalist turn, and as such we should reach out to them and like-minded allies in Spain."
NFA_the_internal_enemy:0 "The Internal Enemy"
NFA_the_internal_enemy_desc:0 "Even in our fort of French nationalism, the internal enemy waits to strike. The Jews, liberals, unruly capitalists, even the supposedly conservative critics of our Order, must be purged if we are to avoid further sabotage and espionage. We shall not repeat the mistakes of the first World War by allowing them to run rampant, and we must be pure if we are to redeem the mainland."
NFA_militia_corporatism:0 "Militia Corporatism"
NFA_militia_corporatism_desc:0 "It is time to further tighten our grip of the market, the market has done its time and has its merits, unfortunately, the capitalists only think of getting rich at the expense of their country, their blood brothers and the national cause. Under Darnand this is no longer the case, the market will be monitored and controlled by our proud legionnaires, the brave sons of the Eternal France, because they are the most able to serve it."
NFA_grand_master:0 "The Grand Master"
NFA_grand_master_desc:0 "We must end this charade of failed defender of France, Petain, being our leader when we have but one Chief of the French, Joseph Darnand. Petain will be respectfully retired and The Grand Master of the Milice shall be granted vastly expanded executive power."
NFA_total_sacrifice:0 "Total Sacrifice"
NFA_total_sacrifice_desc:0 "Passive support for the cause will not do, if we are to take back our homeland the citizenry must give all. Every man who can serve or produce must, every woman who can serve in an auxiliary shall, every gun and vehicle that goes underused must be the Militias. We will not lose for want of manpower or resources, we will squeeze this colony of every drop of blood and sweat."
NFA_industrial_push_command:0 "Industrial Push Command"
NFA_industrial_push_command_desc:0 "Now that we have submitted the market to our will it is time to use it wisely. Great works, as much in the civil and military field as in the naval field, will be undertaken by the Great Master in order to transform our overseas possessions into industrialized territories worthy of our Metropole occupied by the Communards."
NFA_colonial_pacification:0 "Colonial Pacification"
NFA_colonial_pacification_desc:0 "As is Paris, Marseille, Strasbourg or Brest, our once vast colonial empire is an integral part of our great country, our forefathers having fought valiantly under the tricolor flag to earn these resourceful lands. The natives don't seem to understand this reality, they are here in our country, not in theirs, on our French lands, it's time to remind them of this fundamental lesson and to make sure they get it in their heads once and for all, one way or another..."
NFA_the_beautiful_war:0 "The Beautiful War"
NFA_the_beautiful_war_desc:0 "We are ready, after long and costly preparations that have required a lot of hard work from our Grand Master Joseph Darnand, everything is ready to launch the crusade that will bring us home. The Communard dogs will defend themselves, but our proud and strong legionnaires will beat them just as we crushed the Reds of the Paris Commune in 1870. Onward! The only true French will triumph!"

### Napoleon Pre Lib ###
NFA_napoleon_restoration:0 "A Hundred Days Forevermore!"
NFA_napoleon_restoration_desc:0 "A scenario which no one could have ever predicted. By the grace of Petain himself the storied dynasty of Napoléon returned, ready to bring France into a new age of prosperity and splendour. Let this moment mark our first Hundred Days, for they shall never end with another Waterloo."
NFA_parlment_allies:0 "Hunt for Parliamentarian Allies"
NFA_parlment_allies_desc:0 "The return of the Bonaparte dynasty has been met with, less than desirable results among our political class. Many radical republicans have already called for immediate removal of the current government and a referendum to reshape the exiled state into a proper republic. Of course that doesn't mean everyone is hostile to our goals. We just need to find them among the restless masses in the Assembly."
NFA_army_allies:0 "Galvanize the Officer Corp"
NFA_army_allies_desc:0 "The soldiers loved Napoléon I and he loved them too, for who else could have allowed him to bring so much glory to France? We have hoped for the same reaction from the current armed forces stationed in Algeria and we were sadly mistaken. Rumours of mutiny abound and without quick action the military might abandon any plans the newly imperial government sets out before them."
NFA_alone:0 "Alone at the Edge of Abyss"
NFA_alone_desc:0 "All our efforts, a failure. The army, despite their respect for Old Maréchal, is hesitant to support a would-be emperor that has not even commanded a single battle. The parliamentarians too, outraged by the total uprooting of their establishment have boycotted the entire endeavor. If we do not find any allies soon the abyss of history might consume us just like it consumed Napoléon III's restored Empire."
NFA_ask_darnard:0 "Turn to the Legion"
NFA_ask_darnard_desc:0 "The so-called 'Legionaries' of Darnand's Glaive organization are many things, none which would give us popular support among the people which Napoléon VI cares so much about. Yet they also show an uncompromising zeal in purging anyone they deem as threats and with proper encouragement could be turned to strengthen our failing restoration. Desperate times call for utterly reckless measures, after all."
NFA_ask_af:0 "A Plea to Action Française"
NFA_ask_af_desc:0 "Turning to the greatest monarchist association in the nation might seem like an obvious choice in getting wider support for our government. The situation is way more complicated than most foreign observers imagine, for AF supports the Orleans dynasty and their claim to the throne of France. Charles Maurras himself sees Bonapartism as a vile spawn of the Revolution. Hopefully some lower ranking members can be swayed to our cause."
NFA_last_hope:0 "A Dwindling Hope"
NFA_last_hope_desc:0 "Even the old radicals turned their backs to us. The people are already growing tired of the uncertain future of a government which claimed restoration would bring so much glory. There remains one light in such overwhelming darkness, much to both our surprise and horror. The Young Patriots, a loose collection of various rightist political activists have expressed their willingness to support the Emperor."
NFA_prep_for_retvrn:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable Struggle"
NFA_prep_for_retvrn_desc:0 "Our nation since the very start was bound to come into renewed struggle with the Communards over the ultimate fate of France. That much is known by all, yet the political fabric of our society is divided. We must mend it if we are to be united and ready for the great effort to begin anew."
NFA_broad_goverment:0 "Champion a Broader Government"
NFA_broad_goverment_desc:0 "Even though the Jeunesses Patriotes would prefer to continue their mission alone, the words of the Emperor were clear. A new 'broad' government must take shape if we are to remain in his graces. That creates a problem considering most political forces turned away from us or were purged but a group of social democrats which went unnoticed has expressed their warm support for the actions of Napoléon VI."
NFA_oursleves_alone:0 "By Our Hand Alone"
NFA_oursleves_alone_desc:0 "The Patriotic government neither needs nor can it allow treasonous wretches to infest the halls of power. France can only be saved by our hands wielding the blade of destiny. Bonaparte's ambition be damned, the nation ill needs the leeches in human form which politicians are."
NFA_ready_and_waiting:0 "Awaiting the Call"
NFA_ready_and_waiting_desc:0 "The government and military have finally resolved their differences and became united in purpose and ambition. The Liberation War shall come soon enough when the moment is right, all that remains is to await the momentous occasion."
NFA_young_emperor:0 "Le Petit Empereur"
NFA_young_emperor_desc:0 "My great ancestor was called a 'Little Corporal' due to his height, despite all of his accomplishments. I myself have been referred to by my subjects as the 'Little Emperor' due to my young age and supposed inexperience. That matters not, for I still love the people and will do all that the powers vested to me allow to safeguard them from poverty and the excesses of the unlikely fanatics I find myself bound to."
NFA_imperial_safety_net:0 "An Imperial Safety Net"
NFA_imperial_safety_net_desc:0 "Poverty and desolation remain the order of the day in our harsh climate. Not much has been done by the central government to aid the ones suffering most after the exile. The Jeunesses Patriotes might protest, yet it is by my will alone laws are ultimately signed. Thus a moderately sized relief effort shall begin, for a balance between the zealots' suspicion and subjects' health."
NFA_local_democracization:0 "Limited Representation Within Local Bounds"
NFA_local_democracization_desc:0 "Ever since its conception the Algiers government was not truly free, a sad fact everyone had to accept. Although my current allies might scoff at official elections, the people shall be provided with local representation. Let them know that Napoléon cares about their closest concerns and gives them tools to address such crises."
NFA_sucdem_strongman:0 "A Strongman for the People"
NFA_sucdem_strongman_desc:0 "A servant to my people, that is true. A strongman for the 'patriots', perhaps I am. Until the current reality allows it, I will discard any radical demands from the JP so as not to compromise the French population's liberty. Despite the displays of the 'Emperor's strength' which benefit them, they also benefit me. As they are giving me a future blade to decapitate the beast sharpened by the monster itself."
NFA_young_patrioits:0 "Rise of the Jeunesses Patriotes"
NFA_young_patrioits_desc:0 "Never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined that France would call on us, much less the kinsman of the great Bonaparte himself. As the new custodians of those lands we can implement our vision for a truly national France, one which no longer hides away from struggle and allows hidden Communards to roam freely."
NFA_purge_those_against_us:0 "Begin the Third Reign of Terror"
NFA_purge_those_against_us_desc:0 "The vile revolutionaries and their mongrel Communard descendants have sullied France by two great massacres already. A shame which can only be washed away with our hands pulling the guillotine mechanism to cleanse the exiled nation. Let no traitor and Parisian sympathizer escape, for our own revolution demands blood."
NFA_cult_of_nap_i:0 "The Example of Napoléon the Great"
NFA_cult_of_nap_i_desc:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte, an unlikely hero, which France needed at the moment of her weakness caused by indecisive and blind revolutionaries. Such a man of the ages does not appear in the history of the world more than once, which means we can only look up and wonder at his ambitious conquests. May we never forget him and may his soul guide us to achieve comparable greatness!"
NFA_the_enteral_enemy:0 "Exorcise the Crimson Contagion"
NFA_the_enteral_enemy_desc:0 "Despite our grand zeal in purging any red taint among the population the mental miasma of their ideology continues to exist, undisturbed in far flung shadows of our vast realm. By fire that shall change, for the flame shall purify the population of this holy and final bastion of the French people, once and for all."
NFA_for_the_empire:0 "Pour l'Empire!"
NFA_for_the_empire_desc:0 "The Empire, despite all the forces of the universe, was shielded by destiny so it can survive and thrive. The people had their needs addressed and the possible detractors of our cause were dealt with. With our armed forces ready a singular goal remains to be fulfilled. We sail to the mainland, for France and our Emperor's throne!"
### Nap Post Lib###
NFA_the_restored_empire:0 "Destiny Has Accomplished Her Purpose"
NFA_the_restored_empire_desc:0 "It was destiny herself that took Napoléon I to such heights and it is she again carrying us to victory over the damned Communards. With the traitors vanquished we can finally set out to establish a true Empire worthy of all of France."
NFA_bring_forth_the_terror:0 "Le Saint-Just Blanc"
NFA_bring_forth_the_terror_desc:0 "The Archangel of the Terror, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, was the perfect example of the excesses that the bloodthirsty jackals of the so-called 'Great' French Revolution of old were prone to. Yet while his beliefs were vile his methods can be refined, reused to apply towards the worshipers of the Commune. A taste of their own medicine is in order."
NFA_cull_communard_republicanism:0 "Unleash a Second Thermidor"
NFA_cull_communard_republicanism_desc:0 "Just like the Thermidorian Reaction swept away the festering government of Robespierre and his Jacobin clubs, so shall we rip out the dirty claws of the Commune from the glorious land we have recovered. By full renunciation of all that is Red we will uplift our broken fatherland."
NFA_emperors_gambit:0 "Bonaparte Emerges From the Shades"
NFA_emperors_gambit_desc:0 "Louis Bonaparte was never happy with the position he found himself in, having to rely on the young fanatics to consolidate the imperial restoration. In the harsh climate of Algeria he had to tolerate them, but after the liberation of the Metropole his heart breaks with each new information of yet another massacre carried out against civilians by the JP. The time to act is now, and Napoléon VI shall either enter history in glory or be damned forever."
NFA_victory_of_emperor:0 "An Unbound Emperor Triumphant"
NFA_victory_of_emperor_desc:0 "Rejoice, good people of France! Rejoice, for your Emperor has vanquished the corrupt menace which held that murder and governance were equal. With Napoléon VI finally unbound of the so-called 'Patriotic' chains he can restore peace and justice to his Empire."
NFA_target_natpops:0 "Civic Patriotism, Not Radical Barbarism"
NFA_target_natpops_desc:0 "The madmen holding our government hostage believed that nationalism could only be achieved through radical exclusion of elements deemed 'impure'. That is not the way of France or Bonapartes, for all our subjects are part of the national unit. We shall thus prioritize civic model of nationalism, one befitting modernity."
NFA_finish_jp:0 "Cut Out the Jeunesses Cancer"
NFA_finish_jp_desc:0 "While most of the Jeunesses Patriotes leadership has been arrested or outright killed by more eager members of the military, their power base still exists, upkept by the remnants and people of their ideological ilk. We need to sever that cancer from the national body lest it corrupt any part of France once more."
NFA_majestys_goverment:0 "A Temporary Directorate"
NFA_majestys_goverment_desc:0 "While the removal of the JP government was necessary, it resulted in an unforeseen consequence. That being the total downfall of the cabinet. Napoléon has decided to institute a temporary organ modeled on the old Directory to safeguard political stability until elections can be called."
NFA_forgive_communard_moderates:0 "Reconvene with Moderate Metropole Left"
NFA_forgive_communard_moderates_desc:0 "The Metropole was home to all clans of socialism, not only the radical ones who dreamt of executing our Emperor. Owing to his own political leanings and a need for more allies in cementing the democratic empire it would be wise to contact the moderate socialists such as the christians that still remain scattered around the nation."
NFA_olivebranch_libs:0 "An Olive Branch to Liberals"
NFA_olivebranch_libs_desc:0 "It is regrettable that so many liberals perished in actions carried out by JP units. Thankfully, many of them weathered the storm and are happy to provide support in our road towards a democratic rebirth in the Empire."
NFA_democratic_restoration:0 "Rebirth of Imperial Democracy"
NFA_democratic_restoration_desc:0 "At last, we have managed to accomplish what many said to be an utter impossibility. The imperial democracy is real and its first elections are ready to be held. Owing to how little time existed for parties to prepare the only real challengers are two Bonapartist wings, one representing the left and the other the right."
NFA_mandate_of_people:0 "L'Empire Social et Populaire"
NFA_mandate_of_people_desc:0 "The people have spoken and their voice yearns out for security and true progress. The Empire shall thus be led by a government whose vested mission shall be the creation of a popular and social system."
NFA_universal_sufferage:0 "Enshrine the Democratic Rights of the Citizens"
NFA_universal_sufferage_desc:0 "The Great French Revolution gave the world one of the most important documents in humankind's history, the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It's time to continue that legacy by drafting a new document, one that will guarantee democratic and voting rights to all citizens, regardless of their gender or creed."
NFA_honor_vets_of_both_sides:0 "Soldiers of Glory, Distinctions and Rewards"
NFA_honor_vets_of_both_sides_desc:0 "The soldiers themselves, not some lofty generals, led us to victory over the Commune. And it is they who deserve all the medals and distinctions for their glorious exploits. That of course doesn't mean we can forget about the brave patriots who fought for their nation as non-ideological conscripts in the Red army, they too shall be given glory."
NFA_fate_of_church:0 "Gallicanism, Catholicism, Secularism?"
NFA_fate_of_church_desc:0 "Everyone knows the tragedy of the Church during Commune's times. The era of martyrdom for them has ended, yet their position remains unclear in our Empire. Shall we officially embrace the Catholic faith to galvanize the deeply religious population. Or maybe we should keep to republican secularism and keep every religion equal. The last concept, championed by some voices in the Church itself, proposes a renewed Gallicanism so Napoléon can be put above the Pope in terms of authority."
NFA_legacy_of_nap_2:0 "The Liberal Legacy of Grandpa Plon-Plon"
NFA_legacy_of_nap_2_desc:0 "Napoléon VI's dear grandfather Prince Napoléon-Jérôme, affectionately called Plon-Plon, was the strongest liberal voice at the court of Napoléon III. Our Emperor shall embrace his family legacy and continue the progressive cause which seems to be bound to his genes."
NFA_pink_bonepartism:0 "Social-Bonapartism"
NFA_pink_bonepartism_desc:0 "To many a concept of Bonapartism mixed with Social Democracy is anathema, a concept not possible to exist in the world bound by the laws of a simple man's mind. But the people know the truth and understand that we are merely extending Napoléon I's legacy as the heir to the Great Revolution."
NFA_expand_welfare:0 "Care for the Widows & Orphans of the Liberation"
NFA_expand_welfare_desc:0 "A regrettable fact of the Liberation War remains still fresh in our minds, how can it not with the devastation and desolation visible to anyone's eyes. The millions of widows and orphans left by the military struggle shall be cared for thanks to a grand extension to our previous social safety laws."
NFA_protect_worker_rights:0 "The Workers Will Never be Slaves Again"
NFA_protect_worker_rights_desc:0 "Many workers worry that their protections shall be cast aside, sundered by a newly hostile government from beyond the sea. That is nothing more than slander, for the labourer will never be a slave under our benevolent Emperor. We shall keep the most obvious labour laws intact, only removing the ones allowing radical groups to form."
NFA_fate_of_syndie_unions:0 "The Syndical Conundrum"
NFA_fate_of_syndie_unions_desc:0 "The trade unions and syndicates have proven their danger with the illegal overthrow of the mainland government after the First War, but their original goal was in fact noble. It is hard to decide what their fate will be now that we control the Metropole, yet it must be decided once and for all."
NFA_peoples_empire:0 "The People and Their Empire"
NFA_peoples_empire_desc:0 "Louis Napoléon is a happy man at last, so long after first being restored to the throne. He, the government elected thanks to his efforts and most importantly the people under his protection have created a France that exists as a safe haven to all the citizens. No longer shall exploitation, hunger or war threaten the people of our Empire."
NFA_patriots_hold:0 "The Jeunesses Patriotes Hold On"
NFA_patriots_hold_desc:0 "How foolish of the puppet emperor to try and challenge our might. Such insubordination was bound to happen eventually, and we were well prepared to counter his traitorous backstab. With the last obstacle to realizing our true goals removed, it's time to renew France in the Patriotic image."
NFA_a_new_emperor:0 "The Pontecorvo Candidate?"
NFA_a_new_emperor_desc:0 "Louis Bonaparte has proven himself unworthy of the throne which would govern all of the nation, that much is true. Yet many inside our coalition plead for us to crown a replacement, although there are some voices demanding the regency to be kept. The only candidate seriously considered is the actively rightist and bonapartist politician Joachim, 6th Prince Murat of the Pontecorvo Principality."
NFA_honor_general_revanche:0 "Honor Général Revanche"
NFA_honor_general_revanche_desc:0 "Ah, Georges Ernest Boulanger, the General of Revenge, the Father of the French Right. Without him none of our predecessors could not have achieved much and we would not be standing where we are today. Let us honor such a monumental figure and emulate him, for unity is highly desirable for the wide rightist coalition of ours."
NFA_La_Liberte:0 "La Liberte for the Masses"
NFA_La_Liberte_desc:0 "La Liberte was widely distributed in Algeria to show the people our official positions on a wide range of ideological issues. With the Metropole in our grasp we shall expand its circulation so every Frenchman will see what the Patriotic government can provide him. Other newspapers might have their funding suddenly cut because of that, a none concern."
NFA_a_grand_meeting:0 "Convene an Estate-Internal"
NFA_a_grand_meeting_desc:0 "The internal divisions with our government in the aftermath of Napoléon VI's removal have proven to be too much for us to continue as usual. The time is right to convene an internal council sitting with our coalition partners to determine the future shape of our glorious fatherland."
NFA_militarise_empire:0 "An Army Greater Than First Napoléon's"
NFA_militarise_empire_desc:0 "Our grand ambitions require an army fit to coming conflicts, ones which cannot be imagined by average minds. Fortunately, our high command is brilliant, which is exactly why the time is right to start the process of forming an army that even Napoléon I would be jealous of."
NFA_imperial_ultra_catholicism:0 "A Domain Unyielding, Like Saint Denis Himself"
NFA_imperial_ultra_catholicism_desc:0 "We, the true sons of Christ the Savior, have to be unyielding in the face of adversity and danger posed by incarnate demons of all kinds. For that we can look at the story of Bishop Saint Denis of Paris, who was martyred because his soul couldn't allow him to be tainted by renunciation of the One True Lord."
NFA_young_darand:0 "The Emperor's Legion"
NFA_young_darand_desc:0 "We have decided to cooperate with Joseph Darnand and his newly rechristened Emperor's Legion. With their zeal we shall purify the nation so it can experience a true rebirth."
NFA_imperial_corporatism:0 "Corporatism for the Empire"
NFA_imperial_corporatism_desc:0 "Our economy needs a strong basis, one which can support the grand aims that we have set out for it. The time has come to implement Darnand's favoured corporatism as the only official system across the entire land."
NFA_kightly_purification:0 "Cleanse by True Temple's Name"
NFA_kightly_purification_desc:0 "The Empire, so vast and so beautiful, remains infested by numerous parasites. Be they reds, foreigners or even ordinary traitors all must burn. And who else to model our righteous purification campaign after than the knights of the Temple, the uniquely French and unfairly maligned order that valued true faith right to their end."
NFA_legion_empire:0 "In Service of the Emperor, Order and the Legion"
NFA_legion_empire_desc:0 "The Legion, led by the Grandmaster Darnand and reborn in their new purpose, shall protect the Empire of true French citizens and their sovereign until the sun dims forever. No enemy of our state can sleep peacefully when the Emperor's children watch is eternal."
NFA_patroits_alone:0 "The Sole Patriots of France"
NFA_patroits_alone_desc:0 "As we have expected, none of our allies are worthy enough of sharing the power to save France. That is exactly why we, the Jeunesses Patriotes, are the only true patriots capable of leading the people into a glorious future."
NFA_a_nationalist_economy:0 "Many Theories, Singular National Economy"
NFA_a_nationalist_economy_desc:0 "It matters not what system the French economy will utilize, be it distributism, corporatism, right syndicalism or even modern guild framework. For as our party is a united coalition too shall the market be shaped by a coalesced national theory."
NFA_a_parliment_in_check:0 "An Assembly Under Check"
NFA_a_parliment_in_check_desc:0 "The National Assembly was always proving itself to be a less than pleasant machine to work with during any Republic that France had. Even if it would be simpler to get rid of it, many of our party compatriots are committed parliamentarians, despite their authoritarian streak. For now a thorough supervision of the legislative body shall be more than enough."
NFA_the_young_empire:0 "Endless Devotion to the Patrie Impériale"
NFA_the_young_empire_desc:0 "No force on this earth managed to stop our just journey. No traitorous coward of an emperor, no distrustful coalition and no damned Communard. The Empire stands strong, with the devoted patriots forever ready to answer its call and work on its behalf."
NFA_empire_of_faith:0 "A Sacrosanct Realm"
NFA_empire_of_faith_desc:0 "France has always been the Eldest Daughter of the Church and her most stalwart guardian. No heretic or heathen can survive in the land which is home to so many saints and pious individuals. The Empire can never detach itself from that legacy and so Catholicism shall be enshrined as the only official faith in the sacred fatherland."
NFA_honor_saint_louis:0 "Honor the Saintly Louis IX"
NFA_honor_saint_louis_desc:0 "Saint Louis IX was not only a pious and just ruler, but also a great reformer who renewed France's economy and legal system. His crusading spirit remains unmatched since then and serves as a model for us to strive for. For when Le Roi Louis calls upon us we shall go boldly forward, for Christ and all of the Empire whose domain extends to all of the Lord's lands."
NFA_young_af:0 "In Action with Action Française"
NFA_young_af_desc:0 "We have decided to cooperate with Action Française, recently rid of the Maurrassian blight so hostile to Bonapartism. With their help we shall turn our nation into one cohesive organism."
NFA_local_distrubism:0 "Distributism on an Imperial Scale"
NFA_local_distrubism_desc:0 "Despite many mistaking the AF economic thought of integral corporatism with distributism, the former is closer to many post-Maurrassian members that aligned with the JP government. Let us introduce the system outlined by His Holiness Leo XIII himself so the people of our nation can thrive."
NFA_decenterlize_empire:0 "An Empire of Provinces, Not Departments"
NFA_decenterlize_empire_desc:0 "One of the key aspects of integral nationalism remains with the reformed Action, that being the transformation of the revolutionary department system. Only by returning to the Ancien Régime style natural and historical provinces will the local communities be able to restore their forgotten culture."
NFA_organic_empire:0 "One Organism on the Throne"
NFA_organic_empire_desc:0 "The swift and decisive actions of the Jeunesses Action transformed the disorganized Empire into one unified organism. A Throne imperishable ready to face any challenges that the demons of the modern world might throw at the sanctified France."

NFE_reinstate_nap_code:0 "Reinstate and Modernize the Napoleonic Code"
NFE_reinstate_nap_code_desc:0 "The Napoleonic Code was a truly ahead of its time civil codex, one which many nations even today base their jurisdictions upon. If France is to be governed well and efficiently the Code must be dusted off and carefully checked to make sure it is fit for the modern situation it finds itself in."
NFE_emperor_above_state:0 "A Capable Sovereign Above Fearful Parties"
NFE_emperor_above_state_desc:0 "The Emperor, as a monumental figure that has the will to rule, cannot be hindered by weak parties that fear any man strong enough to threaten their status quo. That is exactly why he must stand above them, with the help of his faithful government that is."
NFE_merticertic_empire:0 "The Glory of Meritocracy"
NFE_merticertic_empire_desc:0 "Years go by and eras change yet the corrupt higher class remains, stifling any progress by their incompetent nepotism. The Empire of Napoléon the Great was built upon a strongly meritocratic model which allowed it to excel above ancient regimes of Europe. Such a system must be implemented into our nation immediately if our hopes of becoming a premier world power are to become true.""
NFE_guided_market:0 "Colbertism for a Modern Market"
NFE_guided_market_desc:0 "Colbertism was one if not the greatest invention of the Sun King's era. An economic system created to serve France and the nation's goals alone by the use of strongly centralized mercantilism.

Now, sitting In Paris, Joseph Darnand has near unlimited potential. His many enemies are cowed or dead and the degenerates and sub-humans who deign to call themselves ‘Syndicalists’ cower in their hovels and pray to their Gods Marx and Engles that they may survive.

After many heated arguments with himself and with his trusted advisors Darnand has come up with three options to pick from. The first and most simplest is to simply continue on as he is now and rule as La Maitre. There is no reason to change something that has worked so well until now. Some of the remnant Monarchists within his circle have suggested Joseph crown himself Emperor. This, they claim, would make him on par with the Germans who play at Emperorship. They also feel that the notion of a new French emperor could help Darnand link his regime to the glorious heights of Napoléon I. The third option is probably the most fanciful. They want Darnand to name Pius XII, the rightful Bishop of Rome elected durning the Exile, as the sole ruler of France. Of course this would be in name only, as Darnand would retain total control over the nation. However, rule by a pope would light a fire under the deeply religious French nation. After much agonizing thought, Darnand must come to a decision."

With the True Church now with her True Pontiff, nothing shall stop us from reclaiming and restoring the Church's glory of old. This being the case, the nation has been riled into a religious fervor.

He declared his intention to restore the greatness of France, to achieve the Natural Borders of the French State and to surpass ‘my hallowed predecessor’ Napoléon I. This was met with mixed reactions from the French people. The remnant democrats and Syndicalists rioted soon after the ceremony and were dispersed with live rounds by soldiers. The Monarchists of course celebrated along with, albeit less enthusiastically, Darnands previous supporters. For most Frenchmen however it was a welcome sight.

Many suggestions to fix things envision a Pre-War state of living within two years or less. We know this is frankly unlikely.

NFA_new_peace_desc:0 "Against all odds, Germany has accepted our proposal of a non-interference treaty, and the document has now been signed, stipulating spheres of influence and enshrining a promise of non-aggression. [NFA.GetLeader] has declared that the developments indicate "peace in our time", a sentiment with which much of the world seems to agree, as war and all its horrors are truly averted."
NFA_crush_boches:0 "Crush the Boches"
NFA_crush_boches_desc:0 "Finally, the French nation will have its revenge. Every noble Frenchman who fought and died, seemingly in vain, in 1870 and in 1914 will be avenged by the conquering armies of France, as we march East to destroy the Hunnic filth for good. All for one, and one for all!"

###Post-lib Junta###
NFA_triomphe_du_marechal:0 "Triomphe du Maréchal"
NFA_triomphe_du_marechal_desc:0 "After many long years of exile, Maréchal Pétain has finally won the day, and triumphed over the Red traitors. Some years ago, it seemed inevitable that the military junta would wither away, but without its impressive survival we would never have gotten to this triumphant point."
NFA_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
NFA_martial_law_desc:0 "Although the Martial Law declared in 1936 was never formally lifted, it came to be all too lightly enforced, particularly among white Frenchmen and the more trusted natives. With the situation still unstable and chaotic across the newly-liberated Metropolitan territories, we must restore our commitment to national security, and ensure that traitors are correctly dealt with."
NFA_eliminate_socialists:0 "Eliminate Socialists"
NFA_eliminate_socialists_desc:0 "Socialist resistance and subversion remains rife in spite of our victory. Not only are the frequent terror attacks and ambushes on our troops the doing of Communard remnants, but the regrettable difficulties encountered by our administration are likely also the doing of socialist inflitrators and sympathisers. Waves of arrests of those whose loyalty is suspect, and greater investment in the police and security services, will guard against the red menace."
NFA_protect_veterans:0 "Reward Veterans"
NFA_protect_veterans_desc:0 "There is no section of society more deserving of the nation's respect and gratitude than the heroes who risked their lives for France to be set free. The veterans of the Liberation campaign, especially career soldiers, are among Pétain's most loyal supporters, and extolling the heroism of common soldiers will inevitably legitimize our military government. An extended program of military benefits, and propaganda to portray veterans as the greatest heroes of France, will go a long way to strengthening our hand."
NFA_cdg_govt:0 "The de Gaulle Government"
NFA_cdg_govt_desc:0 "Following the retirement of our leader, Philippe Pétain, his protégé and Premier, Charles de Gaulle has succeeded him as President and leader of the military junta. The young general must now deal with the remaining resistance, including his rivals within the military, and settle the renewed question of monarchism, a cause with which he has been known to sympathise."
NFA_break_parliamentarism:0 "Break Parliamentary Weakness"
NFA_break_parliamentarism_desc:0 "For too long, the lingering influence of civilian politicians and the parliamentary establishment has divided the nation and undermined its true leaders, the military. Only a President given free reign to defend the nation's interests, as Pétain should have been years ago, can truly serve the people. As such, we must eliminate the influence of liberal politicians and push through new legislation to give de Gaulle greater prerogatives to lead the French nation onwards."
NFA_central_economic_planning:0 "Central Economic Planning"
NFA_central_economic_planning_desc:0 "A central executive is necessary not just to ensure stability and order, but also to defend the interests of the people, not least in financial affairs. A planned economy, regulated from [NFA.Capital.GetName] for the collective good, is necessary, with the market held in check and forced to serve the interests of the public, to ensure collaboration between classes."
NFA_taste_of_equality:0 "A Taste of Equality"
NFA_taste_of_equality_desc:0 "If we are to avoid future class conflicts and defuse red subversion, we must make the people feel that their needs will be served and defended under our own government, which can improve their life and promote their interests. Greater provision for employment programs and social security will ensure the contentment and loyalty of the common man."
NFA_strike_at_dissident_officers:0 "Strike at Dissident Officers"
NFA_strike_at_dissident_officers_desc:0 "There are many military leaders still lurking in the background whose loyalty to de Gaulle is far from assured, such as Maxime Weygand, with whom he has often clashed on military doctrine, and François Darlan, his long standing rival within the junta. These men are imminent threats to our hold on power, and must be dealt with, whatever the cost."
NFA_purity_of_joan_of_arc:0 "The Purity of Jeanne d'Arc"
NFA_purity_of_joan_of_arc_desc:0 "Saint Jeanne d'Arc, the peasant girl who nobly came to the defence of the nation in the Hundred Years' War, is the perfect ideal for the French people to aspire to. Pious, patriotic, and valiant, every citizen should aspire to emulate her virtues. New education and cultural programmes will ensure that these principles are central to our culture."
NFA_presidential_state:0 "Presidential State"
NFA_presidential_state_desc:0 "Monarchy may be as good a means of ensuring strong and central power as any other, but due to French monarchism's association with the Maurrassians, who advocate for a reckless loosening of central authority, and the potential of a separate head of state to undermine de Gaulle's leadership, we should instead structure our new constitution around a strong Presidency."
NFA_restore_the_monarchy:0 "Restore the Monarchy"
NFA_restore_the_monarchy_desc:0 "General de Gaulle, having grown up in a devoutly Catholic family and been influenced to some extent by the writings of Maurras, has never hidden his monarchist sympathies. Although the General's vision of a monarchy, as a central unifying force, diverges heavily from the Maurrassian ideal of a localist state, de Gaulle has resolved to put Henri d'Orléans, Count of Paris, on the throne, in order to legitimise the continued Junta and serve as a centralising figurehead."
NFA_concentrated_power:0 "Concentrated Power"
NFA_concentrated_power_desc:0 "Only if executive power is concentrated in the person of de Gaulle can the executive fulfill its duty to defend and uplift the people. Just as de Gaulle's military theories have seen large numbers of tanks concentrated in hard-hitting offensives, his rule over France will see power concentrated in his office, with nothing but benefits for the common man."
NFA_deal_with_maurrasians:0 "The Maurrassian Question"
NFA_deal_with_maurrasians_desc:0 "With Henri on the throne, de Gaulle's government has won some admiration among the integral nationalists of the Action Française, while de Gaulle has long harboured some admiration for Maurras himself. Nevertheless, the Maurrassians diverge significantly from our government's own centralist policies, and are distrusted by many within the junta. We must tread carefully as we decide our policy towards them."
NFA_croix_de_feu_absorption:0 "Croix-de-Feu Absorption"
NFA_croix_de_feu_absorption_desc:0 "With de Gaulle having chosen to establish a strong Presidency, the Catholic Corporatist Croix-de-Feu party, which has long used its influence within the junta to advocate for such a system, has doubled down on its support for us, and it would be wise to consolidate our ties with them. Nevertheless, some believe that de Gaulle should be wary of its leaders' ambitions."
NFA_guarantor_of_independence:0 "Guarantor of Independence"
NFA_guarantor_of_independence_desc:0 "It is essential that the empowered President is seen by the nation as its protector and the guarantor of its independence from foreign threats, and that he receives sufficient control over foreign policy to make these claims a reasonable one. De Gaulle's greater involvement in foreign affairs will ensure that France can sufficiently pull its weight on the world stage."
NFA_guide_growth:0 "Guide Growth"
NFA_guide_growth_desc:0 "As the economy recovers from the devastation of the Liberation, and begins to grow once more, it is vital that the state intervenes sufficiently to guide this growth that it might truly benefit the common Frenchman. New corporate taxes and increased public spending will ensure that a strong economy can be enjoyed by every citizen."
NFA_splendour_of_the_strong:0 "The Splendour of the Strong"
NFA_splendour_of_the_strong_desc:0 "Charles de Gaulle has consolidated his grip on power within the junta and within France itself, and shrewd political alliances alongside a reformist economic policy have won him the admiration of much of the population. The necessary strong government of the military will be able to continue for years, and we can breathe a sigh of relief as we know that, under deGaulle’s Leadership, France will not come to harm."
NFA_darlan_govt:0 "The Darlan Government"
NFA_darlan_govt_desc:0 "Following the retirement of our leader, Philippe Pétain, his protégé and Premier, François Darlan, has succeeded him as President and leader of the military junta. The successful Admiral must now deal with the remaining resistance, including his rivals within the military, and establish a foreign policy more in line with his naval interests, and rabid Anglophobia."
NFA_break_with_british:0 "Break With the British"
NFA_break_with_british_desc:0 "All his life, Darlan's has subscribed to Anglophobia, and the past several years have only deepened his distaste for the opportunism and perfidy of our supposed allies. Now that France has been liberated, we no longer have any need for English meddling in our affairs, or for the pretence of friendship. It is time for France to show the world what it's made of, and go it alone."
NFA_gather_allies:0 "Gather Allies"
NFA_gather_allies_desc:0 "Now that we have broken off the Entente Cordiale, we will need new friends. As such, Darlan has called for the creation of a new system of Paris Protocols, for mutual defence and co-operation among nations neither in the British nor German spheres. Only time will tell whether or not this initiative is a success."
NFA_naval_supremacy:0 "Naval Supremacy"
NFA_naval_supremacy_desc:0 "It was the heroism of the Navy which made the Liberation possible, and they were the only section of the military that was never defeated in the Great War. It thus only follows that the Navy should be given special powers over the other sections of the Armed Forces, and that they should dominate the French government."
NFA_eliminate_disloyal_generals:0 "Eliminate Disloyal Generals"
NFA_eliminate_disloyal_generals_desc:0 "There are still those within the armed forces who are opposed to Darlan's government and his vision of a France guided by the Navy, not least his long-time rival within the junta, Charles de Gaulle. These individuals will only undermine us more and more as time goes by, and we must deal with them swiftly and mercilessly."
NFA_bolster_merchant_marine:0 "Bolster the Merchant Marine"
NFA_bolster_merchant_marine_desc:0 "As we come to dominate the seas, we will have far greater potential to trade around the world, growing our own economy and gaining influence in other countries. In order to do this, however, we will need a strong Merchant Marine, with sufficient ships and sufficient protection from our navy to support an emerging trading empire."
NFA_empower_officer_corps:0 "Empower the Naval Officer Corps"
NFA_empower_officer_corps_desc:0 "As the Navy was the only undefeated part of the military in 1919, and went on to be absolutely crucial to the Liberation campaign, it has shown beyond any doubt that it is the superior branch of the Armed Forces, and indeed the only branch with the credibility to lead the nation onwards. A further effort to fill government posts with naval officers will ensure our dominance."
NFA_control_mediterranean:0 "Control the Mediterranean"
NFA_control_mediterranean_desc:0 "Nothing is as vital to our security as control over the Mediterranean Sea, through which much of our commerce must flow, and which connects us to the colonial empire. As such, we must look to secure our grip over strategic points through the Sea. Only then can our safety on land and sea be assured."
NFA_goods_for_the_masses:0 "Goods for the Masses"
NFA_goods_for_the_masses_desc:0 "Our stronger grip over world trade now allows us to give the ordinary Frenchman access to what were once luxury goods, and in no short supply. By making goods from across the world available, and also ensuring a good supply of more essential products, we can bolster the economy and ensure the contentment and loyalty of the people."
NFA_improve_the_constitution:0 "An Improved Constitution"
NFA_improve_the_constitution_desc:0 "The old constitution of the Third Republic, suspended for years now, is thoroughly inadequate for our military government and its duty to serve and defend the people, and the legal paralysis of its ongoing suspension is sure to cause more crises. As such, Darlan has ordered the drafting of a new Constitution entirely for the French nation."
NFA_national_propaganda_machine:0 "National Propaganda Machine"
NFA_national_propaganda_machine_desc:0 "Admiral Darlan understands that it is essential to maintain the people's loyalty, by maintaining control over the information that they consume. It is crucial that the narratives within the media are consistent, coherent, and above all favourable towards the government and President. A more direct state involvement in propaganda, and greater intervention in the media, will ward off subversion for good."
NFA_the_unchallenged_fleet:0 "The Unchallenged Fleet"
NFA_the_unchallenged_fleet_desc:0 "At last, Admiral Darlan has secured his grip on power within the military and the government, within France as a whole, and most crucially on the world stage. No nation dares to stand in the way of the French Navy, and our dominance of the Seas and of world trade has ensured prosperity for the French people, and influence across the globe. Vive Admiral Darlan, et Vive la France!"
NFA_constitutional_restoration:0 "Constitutional Restoration"
NFA_constitutional_restoration_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain has given in to the pressure from his allies in civilian politics, who continued to support his government following his consolidation of power, and formally restored the constitution of the Third Republic, suspended years earlier. Although many celebrate this as a step towards democracy, Pétain has made clear that he intends to remain in power, and the junta, for now at least, remains in place."
NFA_rapid_decollectivisation:0 "Rapid Decollectivisation"
NFA_rapid_decollectivisation_desc:0 "One of the greatest evils of the Commune was its collectivisation of agriculture and industry, which required the theft of farms and factories from their rightful owners and almost invariably led to horrendous inefficiency. Whatever the short-ter consequences, reversing these disastrous policies is vital for the future of France."
NFA_entrench_business_ties:0 "Entrench Business Ties"
NFA_entrench_business_ties_desc:0 "In order to prevent the restoration of the Constitution from spiraling out of control and ending the Junta, we must consolidate our alliances with influential businessmen and ensure that the reduction in the junta's authoritarianism goes hand-in-hand with a reduction in economic intervention, thus ensuring that the business community will prop up our government."
NFA_correct_state_intervention:0 "Minimise State Intervention"
NFA_correct_state_intervention_desc:0 "In exchange for their continued support and loyalty, we should ensure that our allies in business have a freer hand to innovate and create wealth for the nation, cutting back the red tape that constrains businesses and slashing taxes in order to remove pointless checks on the market's ability to bring prosperity to the nation."
NFA_review_our_rhetoric:0 "Review Our Rhetoric"
NFA_review_our_rhetoric_desc:0 "Before the Liberation, the junta came to use radically anti-parliamentarian and deeply traditionalist rhetoric, promising an arch-conservative 'Révolution Nationale' that would end the Republic for good and restore a traditional ideal of France. This is of course at odds with our new policies, and we must find a way to end the Révolution Nationale without too much controversy."
NFA_delegate_to_civilians:0 "Delegate to Civilians"
NFA_delegate_to_civilians_desc:0 "With our recent moves having won back the loyalty of civilian politicians and the more liberal part of the population, we should put this new-found support to good use and restore civilian involvement in government, with capable politicians and industrialists taking over important government posts while the military remains in control, guiding the nation to ensure stability."
NFA_constitutional_ideal:0 "Safe Elections"
NFA_constitutional_ideal_desc:0 "The restored Constitution forces us to accept frequent elections for all manner of government positions, which if left unchecked could be a major liability to the stability of our rule. Of course, we cannot let the situation deteriorate to that point, and thus we must now look into means of ensuring that these elections are won by good, trustworthy men who will serve France, and its leader, to the best of their capability."
NFA_president_for_life:0 "Lifetime Presidency"
NFA_president_for_life_desc:0 "Currently, the Constitution forces term limits on the Presidency, meaning that one day Pétain would be legally obliged to retire from his office. Of course, such a prospect is thoroughly unacceptable, and among other amendments needed to ensure stability, we can remove all term limits from the constitution, to prolong the Maréchal's benign leadership as far as possible."
NFA_revolving_door:0 "The Revolving Door"
NFA_revolving_door_desc:0 "As we further cement our ties with civilian politics and industry, we should secure the existence of a "Revolving Door" between the military, business, and politics, with loyal and capable men going between these three areas of public life, to ensure uniform competence and loyalty between all three, and further cement our influence through society."
NFA_patriotism_and_productivity:0 "Patriotism and Productivity"
NFA_patriotism_and_productivity_desc:0 "With our alliance with business secure, we should look to remind the people that socialistic demands for heavy-handed state intervention will only weaken the economy and promote Communard revivals, and are thus immensely unpatriotic and seditious. Meanwhile, we should further encourage our friends in industry to do their very best to drive uup growth and productivity, ensuring that the people are content with the results of our policies."
NFA_republican_caesarism:0 "Republican Caesarism"
NFA_republican_caesarism_desc:0 "Just as Caesar's strong leadership and fearless charisma was the last hope of the Roman Republic, until his tragic assassination, Maréchal Pétain's leadership and charisma is the only thing that has allowed the values and ideals of the French Republic to live on, triumphing over stale reactionaries and socialist traitors alike. A new propaganda campaign will ensure that the people know this, and continue to be inspired by Pétain's heroism."
NFA_freedom_under_the_marechal:0 "Freedom Under the Maréchal"
NFA_freedom_under_the_marechal_desc:0 "With our reforms secured, we have managed to both secure the position of the military government and Pétain's loyalists, but also to give the French people genuine freedom, both financial and political, as Republican life slowly returns under the benign presidency of Philippe Pétain, the saviour of the French Republic."
NFA_continue_revolution_nationale:0 "The Révolution Nationale Continues"
NFA_continue_revolution_nationale_desc:0 "Maréchal Pétain, the hero and saviour of France, has inevitably seen off the subversive demands of ambitious officers and corrupt liberals alike. Pétain now stands truly triumphant over the French nation, with a free hand to continue the National Revolution and restore traditional ideals of France."
NFA_military_supremacy:0 "Military Supremacy"
NFA_military_supremacy_desc:0 "It was the military, and only the military, that freed this nation from the red tyrants. Their strategies, their commitment, their sacrifices, and crucially their leadership of the French nation through the Junta was what made the Liberation at all possible. Neither ourselves or the French people must ever forget that, and it is essential that the military continues to form the backbone of the government."
NFA_un_ordre_moral:0 "Un Ordre Moral"
NFA_un_ordre_moral_desc:0 "Central to the ideology of the National Revolution is a traditionalist ideal of French Catholoc culture, based around ruralism and a moral society. It is this ideal which Pétain's government must now implement in the freed métropole, with the Junta having committed itself to a restoration of traditional moral values. New education and cultural programmes will make this ideal a reality."
NFA_rewrite_the_constitution:0 "Rewrite the Constitution"
NFA_rewrite_the_constitution_desc:0 "The ongoing suspension of the Constitution of the Third Republic is only an issue for us in the long term, creating needless legal paralysis and likely to cause future government crises. As such, Pétain has commissioned the drafting of a new constitution, one which will enshrine the principles of the Révolution Nationale and provide for strong, secure leadership."
NFA_break_republican_modernism:0 "End Republican Modernism"
NFA_break_republican_modernism_desc:0 "Under weak parliamentary rule in the Third Republic, the moral values and traditional ideals which generations of Frenchmen held dear were degraded and attacked by rootless elites. With our government secure, however, we can work to mend this damage, and restore the true Christian values of France: work, family, and fatherland."
NFA_sole_leadership:0 "Sole Leadership"
NFA_sole_leadership_desc:0 "Maréchal Pétain, a hero of the French nation for decades now and a highly astute politician, has no need for his strong leadership to be meddled with or lessened by any over-ambitious crony or subversive politician. New laws concentrating executive and legislative power in the Presidency will guarantee that Pétain can lead France on to glory."
NFA_social_duty_of_army:0 "The Social Duty of the Army"
NFA_social_duty_of_army_desc:0 "Although the military as an institution has achieved supreme power within France, it nevertheless has a duty to the people. It is that duty that causes the military to fight at all, that duty which inspired the military to liberate France, and that duty which lies at the heart of the Révolution Nationale. Under the paternal guidance of its army, France will prosper like never before."
NFA_subordinate_capitalists:0 "Subordinate the Capitalists"
NFA_subordinate_capitalists_desc:0 "Although we are deeply grateful for the support that the Junta received from those in business before the liberation, we must not get ahead of ourselves in restoring unchecked capitalism or irresponsible business practices. The market must know its place, and be held to account in its social duty to provide for the common man, by a new programme of responsible state intervention."
NFA_return_to_the_earth:0 "Return to the Earth"
NFA_return_to_the_earth_desc:0 "As we seek to promote a revived moral order, we must also promote a revival of the conditions from which that moral order arose: a stable and pious countryside, dedicated to hard work and faith, and confident in its trust in the government. A new state programme will do its best to encourage good Frenchmen to move to the countryside, and return to their ancestors' agrarian lifestyle."
NFA_yeoman_idealism:0 "Yeoman Idealism"
NFA_yeoman_idealism_desc:0 "With a growing rural population, which is increasingly loyal to the government due to our agrarian policies and ideological admiration of the countryside, we can now foster among these citizens a revived ideal of the Yeoman farmer, a pious and brave citizen called from the fields to defend France and its government when the time comes. The countryside is sure to produce our most loyal soldiers, and thus a future generation of leaders."
NFA_marechal_nous_voila:0 "Maréchal, Nous Voila!"
NFA_marechal_nous_voila_desc:0 "Having vanquished all threats to his government time and again, and succeeded in rebuilding the métropole into a prosperous agrarian nation, Philippe Pétain has at last triumphed in his mission to liberate and restore the true France. With the entire nation united under God and disciplined by their Marshal, Pétain is ready to lead France into a new age of glory!"

NFA_return_of_the_king:0 "Return of the King"
NFA_return_of_the_king_desc:0 "After every trial and tribulation, whether under Bonapartist usurpers, Republican demagogues, or Socialist tyrants, France has at last been freed, and in the truest sense of the word.For the first time since 1848, it has a rightful and legitimate King at its head, embodying the sole institution capable of balancing the eternal liberties of the French people with the need for order: the monarchy."
NFA_maurrasians_hold_on:0 "Maurrassians Hold On"
NFA_maurrasians_hold_on_desc:0 "The move from Paris to Algiers, combined with the shock of rapid decentralisation at the same time as a larger political shift, came close to undermining Maurras's government. However, the loyalty of the AF's allies in the military, particularly General de Hauteclocq, and the determined courage of our supporters, has ensured that the just and valiant leadership offered by the AF will continue, and restore France to the great nation that it was always meant to be."
NFA_enfore_integralist_consistency:0 "Enforce Integralist Consistency"
NFA_enfore_integralist_consistency_desc:0 "The recent crisis proved that our government has still failed to sufficiently assert itself, and prove to the French people that its vision is the only right one for the nation. By popularising Maurrassian principles in speeches and propaganda, we can end the popular ignorance of our political doctrines, and it is imperative that we make sure our narrative and rhetoric remains consistent, if we are to appear a strong and dynamic government."
NFA_local_reconstruction_committees:0 "Local Reconstruction Committees"
NFA_local_reconstruction_committees_desc:0 "With the shock of our initial measures towards decentralising governance having subsided, we can now further solidify local power by allowing loyal regional governments, formed by local Maurrassian supporters and with the full backing of the Crown, to manage the post-war recovery, both social and economic, on their own terms. This measure will ensure that our long standing principles are put into practice, and will guarantee that each region of France can rebuild itself in a manner that suits itself."
NFA_cleanse_socialist_decadence:0 "Cleanse Socialist Decadence"
NFA_cleanse_socialist_decadence_desc:0 "The socialism that overtook France in the last two decades was merely an acceleration of the rapid decline of the Civilised World, into a state of materialistic and anarchic decadence, which has been ongoing since the French Revolution. Now that Socialism, the most hideous by-product of this degeneration, lies defeated, its causes and influence must be weeded out throughout French society, whatever the cost, setting a model to the whole world."
NFA_restore_the_pays_reel:0 "Supremacy of the Pays Réel"
NFA_restore_the_pays_reel_desc:0 "Maurras has long observed that there are two Frances, which exist largely apart from the other. There is the Pays Légal, a soulless mess of documents and officials in [NFA.Capital.GetName], powerless before global finance and social degeneration. And then there is the true France, the Pays Réel, the loyal and devoted people of this nation, who have remained loyal to their traditions and the national cause in spite of all. By greatly diminishing the ability of the central bureaucracy to interfere with regional governments, we can ensure that the Real Country asserts itself."
NFA_restore_provincial_parliaments:0 "Power to the Provinces"
NFA_restore_provincial_parliaments_desc:0 "What generations of decadent Republicans termed the "Ancien Regime" in truth held the key to reliable governance: each province of the Kingdom, within its own boundaries, could enjoy the protection and guidance of the Crown, while governing itself with a high degree of autonomy through its own Parliament, conscious of local needs while also devoted to the Crown and national interest. By restoring these Parliaments, we shall come far closer to restoring the old, true France."
NFA_eliminate_traitors:0 "Eliminate Traitors"
NFA_eliminate_traitors_desc:0 "The issues that we faced in the immediate aftermath of the defeat of the Commune made it all too clear that the enemy within, from the remaining agents of Masonic Jewry to mere petty opportunists, continues to lurk in the shadows, poised to strike at the Kingdom. As such, we must once again conduct a thorough sweep of our government, the civil service, and the military, to hunt down all who are disloyal to our ideals."
NFA_party_dominance:0 "Party Dominance"
NFA_party_dominance_desc:0 "The Action Française has existed as a political movement, in one form or another, since the Dreyfus Affair, and throughout its long life it has inspired many both in France and around the world to stand up for values that they know to be true. However, if our own government is to last and prosper, we must work to make the Party a social institution, incentivising membership and ensuring that ordinary people can use the Party and its internal institutions to push for their goals, granting true freedom to the Pays Réels under the guidance of the King and his cabinet."
NFA_compulsory_camelot_membership:0 "Compulsory Camelot Membership"
NFA_compulsory_camelot_membership_desc:0 "The Camelots du Roi, an institution serving as both a party youth movement and political paramilitary, was granted sweeping powers not long after we first assumed power. However, now that France has been liberated, the Camelots will play a vital role in our efforts to make the Party a major social institution, through which true patriots can exercise political power within their local regions. Mandatory enrollment in the organisation for young men will guarantee that they learn loyalty to the King, and find a place in our new social hierarchy."
NFA_protect_regional_culture:0 "Regional Cultural Revivals"
NFA_protect_regional_culture_desc:0 "No longer can hedonistic socialist internationalism, or the cosmopolitan spirit of a Republic centralised in Paris, threaten and degrade the cultures of each distinct part of France. With the local AF Branches now dominant in each region, alongside the Aristocracy and loyal clergymen, we can focus on restoring the distinct and beautiful cultures and identities of the regions of France, each one integral to the nation as a whole."
NFA_responsible_christian_unions:0 "Union Royale du Travail"
NFA_responsible_christian_unions_desc:0 "The working class of France will always have its grievances, as does every other element of a hierarchical society. However, it is imperative that these grievances are never again allowed to be subverted by Judeo-Masonic Socialists, and our social hierarchy must be built around trust and co-operation. As such, a new national trade union, the Royal Union of Labour, will function within the Party, with its leadership decentralised between the Kingdom's provinces, allowing workers to legitimately improve their lot in harmony with the Crown."
NFA_af_newspaper_circulation:0 "Push the AF Newspaper"
NFA_af_newspaper_circulation_desc:0 "Since the Action Française's founding, our eponymous newspaper has been instrumental in disseminating Maurrassian doctrine, providing commentary on current affairs, and rallying support for the Party. As we consolidate the position of the Party as a universal institution upon which Latin social hierarchies can be built, it is essential that we pour maximum effort into increasing the circulation of this newspaper, ensuring that every Frenchman understands our narrative."
NFA_nationalist_intellectual_rebirth:0 "Nationalist Intellectual Rebirth"
NFA_nationalist_intellectual_rebirth_desc:0 "Maurrasisme, and the AF as a whole, was born out of the many different strands of rightist nationalism that took hold among French intellectuals towards the end of the 19th Century, and were accentuated by the Dreyfus Affair. However, Maurras and most of his old comrades are now old men, and to truly secure the longevity of our ideals we must ensure that the younger generation is ready to carry the flame of integral nationalism, by promoting nationalist movements among students, and ensuring that Maurrassian politics is dominant within the universities."
NFA_agrarian_investments:0 "Agrarian Investments"
NFA_agrarian_investments_desc:0 "The epitome of Maurras's ideal of a good Frenchmen, the embodiment of the Pays Réel, is a humble and patriotic yeoman farmer, living a simple and moral life out in the field, and always ready to answer the call of his nation. While we disseminate propaganda urging a return to the fields and encouraging Frenchmen to take up an agrarian way of life, we must also invest heavily in the countryside, to uplift and reward the loyal farmers and artisans of France."
NFA_organic_state_realised:0 "The Organic State Realised"
NFA_organic_state_realised_desc:0 "After every struggle which we have necessarily endured over the AF's long history, and after all the hellish bloodshed of the Liberation, France is at last truly free. Maurras has realised his dream of an orderly, organic nation, built around a natural social hierarchy, and loyal to the values of the Latin race, all united under a valiant and wise King. With the place of the AF Party fully secure and the people's loyalty assured, we truly have succeeded. Vive le Roi, et Vive la France!"
NFA_the_cowled_men:0 "The Cowled Men"
NFA_the_cowled_men_desc:0 "Maurras was, in truth, too old and hesitant to give France the strong leadership that it truly needs. His government's weakness and inaction gave way to social chaos amidst suicidal policies of decentralisation, making it absolutely imperative for Eugène Deloncle to step in, alongside his longstanding allies in business and the intelligence services. Now at the helm of the Kingdom, Deloncle promises a new revolutionary outlook, and unwavering determination to build a bold new vision of France."
NFA_dynamic_heroism:0 "Heroic Dynamism"
NFA_dynamic_heroism_desc:0 "Only a government dedicated to action and idealism, under principled and dynamic leadership, can be a righteous government, and such a righteous government is what we can now build. For Deloncle and his inner circle to rebuild France and its society, they must assume absolute power throughout the nation, sweeping aside both the King's prerogatives, and Maurras's feeble attempts to create a balance powers through decentralisation. France will be one nation, strong and united under its Chief."
NFA_revolutionary_action:0 "Revolutionary Action"
NFA_revolutionary_action_desc:0 "Although the AF's traditionalist principles were admirable, Maurras never went far enough in his assessment of the causes of today's decadence, accepting rationalism and enlightenment philosophy. Only a true Revolution in France, a nationalist and popular Revolution against all the corrupting principles of Enlightenment thought and degenerate culture, can restore France to genuine traditionalism. All barriers to such a Revolution must be swept away by Deloncle's government."
NFA_legionary_rehabillitation:0 "Rule By the Shadows"
NFA_legionary_rehabillitation_desc:0 "Deloncle has always led a secretive clique, rather than a political party, and although he now finds himself at the head of the French nation, and building a new mass movement, the sanctity of his inner circle must be preserved. The upper levels of power will be fully concentrated in the hands of trustworthy Cagoulards, initiated into our order and trusted by the Chief. Only thus can we be certain of the security of our power."

NFA_social_revolution_desc:0 "It is time for the French people to finally stand up for their ideals, and throw off every false and degenerate assertion of the last 300 years, which has been forced upon them by insidious foreign forces, acting to destroy all that is good in France. A true Social Revolution, led on by Deloncle and enforced by his supporters, will use mass political force to topple all these vile ideas, and rebuild the true France."
NFA_consolidate_intelligence_alliance:0 "Intelligence Alliances"
NFA_consolidate_intelligence_alliance_desc:0 "Many of those within Deloncle's inner circle, and many of his allies outside of it, come from the intelligence services, an institution more than used to shadowy plots, and devoted to anti-socialism. Thus, it is crucial that we further entrench these alliances, giving Deloncle allies such as Loustanau-Lacau top jobs within the intelligence services and initiating as many operatives into La Cagoule as we can."
NFA_ensure_market_loyalty:0 "Win Over the Capitalists"
NFA_ensure_market_loyalty_desc:0 "Some within the business community in France, such as Eugène Schueller and Louis Renault, have long been trustworthy supporters of Deloncle, with Schueller giving Cagoulard groups access to his property and funds while being a valued associate of Deloncle. We should expand on these alliances, relaxing Maurrassian corporatist policies and giving business leaders more free reign to innovate, in exchange for pledges of loyalty, and also initiate the most loyal into La Cagoule."
NFA_new_chivalric_elite:0 "A New Chivalric Elite"
NFA_new_chivalric_elite_desc:0 "With the order of La Cagoule expanding and coming to dominate most aspects of French society, we should further consolidate its internal structures and hierarchies, with Deloncle and his closest allies at the top, and demanding full support, while the most loyal and capable can work their way through the ranks of the Order. Like the Knightly Orders of old, we have a clear mission, to be the vanguards of France's Counter-Revolution, and the dynamic leadership needed to succeed."
NFA_destroy_outside_subversion:0 "Expunge Subversion"
NFA_destroy_outside_subversion_desc:0 "Our Order is still, in spite of all our efforts, threatened by a multitude of unscrupulous forces. From Maurrassian remnants, to socialist partisans, to the remaining liberals, many still stand in opposition to our Revolution. This can persist for no longer, and it is time that the full wrath of La Cagoule is directed at these scum who would subjugate France once more. There can be no mercy for a traitor, for he has abandoned all principles."

NFA_le_chef_et_le_roi_desc:0 "With Deloncle now wielding absolute power, both through the regular apparatus of state and through his place at the top of La Cagoule, it is time for him to be shown the respect deserved by the Chief of the French. Every citizen, from His Majesty to the lowliest workers and peasants, will show undying loyalty to the Saviour of France, and the popular fury of the ongoing Social Revolution will be unleashed on those who stand in Deloncle's way."
NFA_ritualistic_nationalism:0 "Cagoulard Rituals"
NFA_ritualistic_nationalism_desc:0 "La Cagoule's secretive and elitist structure has long functioned through a strictly observed and highly intricate system of rites and rituals, partly modelled on those present in Freemasonry, and also with an over ultranationalist slant. With the Order and its internal hierarchies now being steadily bolstered, we should expand this system of rituals to become a staple of every Cagoulard's life, and a demonstration of loyalty to the Chief."

NFA_absolute_loyalty_desc:0 "Every Frenchman must value one word, one principle, above all else: loyalty. It is crucial for our Revolution to succeed that all show the respect they must towards their King, their Chief, their superiors within society, and, should they be members of our Order, to senior Cagoulards. Only this absolute and unquestioning fealty can revive the best of the French spirit, with total devotion to authority stimulating the awakening of the nation."

NFA_national_social_ideal_desc:0 "Finally, French society is showing the results of our Revolution, with radical nationalism, discipline, and loyalty becoming deeply valued among every good Frenchman. With France at last corresponding to his vision, Deloncle can now proclaim that his ideal of a nation that is both National - ethnically pure and determined to retain its nationhood - and Social - built around simultaneous values of solidarity and hierarchy - has been realised."

NFA_de_gaulle_putsch_desc:0 "Although he felt that the Restoration of the Monarchy was to be welcomed as a unifying force and opportunity for political change, and had to cooperate with the Maurrassians in order to gain the military strength to save France, Charles de Gaulle never believed in the Maurrassian dream of an arch-traditionalist and decentralised state. Following the chaos caused by Maurras's rushed attempts to realise such a state, de Gaulle has intervened to restore order, returning military rule to France."
NFA_disarm_camelots:0 "Disarm the Camelots"
NFA_disarm_camelots_desc:0 "The Camelots du Roi were the longstanding paramilitary force of the Action Française, supporting the party line in street fights while also serving as a youth movement for the sons of Maurrassian supporters. During Maurras's time in power they, and their leader Maurice Pujo, gained immense influence in the government, and are now doing their best to resist de Gaulle's seizure of power. Formally banning the organisation, and disarming those who resist, should remove this obstacle."

NFA_crackdown_on_radicals_desc:0 "France is simply too civilised, too great a nation to allow the madness of political radicalism to threaten it, as was shown by the twin failures of Socialism and Integralism. Instead, a responsible and capable centralised state, held in check by the Crown and the military, will justly exercise power over the nation, to defend France from any future challenges. How, after all, can you awaken radical fanaticism in a country that has two hundred and forty-six varieties of cheese?"
NFA_secure_our_grip:0 "Cement Our Grip"
NFA_secure_our_grip_desc:0 "With [NFA.Capital.GetName] firmly in our hands, we must ensure the uniform loyalty of all areas of France, a task made harder by the autonomy that each region came to enjoy in the dying days of the AF. Military units will be deployed across the country, to quell the unrest awakened by de Gaulle's coup, and to guarantee that resistance is quashed and each region of the nation is loyal to the government."

NFA_fate_of_old_regime_desc:0 "We have put an end to the localist and decentralist madness of the Action Francaise which was destroying France from the inside when we took power, however a question remains, what to do with the leaders of the Action Francaise?  These, including Charles Maurra, will be brought before the state tribunals that will decide their fate."
NFA_end_localist_madness:0 "Reverse Localist Madness"
NFA_end_localist_madness_desc:0 "The fanatical regionalism of Maurras and his sycophants would have doomed France to eternal inertia and instability, had it ever been genuinely realised. Thankfully, the new government under de Gaulle knows perfectly well that only strong central power, exercised both through the Crown and the Premiership, can preserve stability and unite the nation. With [NFA.Capital.GetName] firmly at the centre of the political process, France will be safe from all radical threats."

NFA_veteran_support_desc:0 "De Gaulle, a deeply charismatic general who was instrumental in the Liberation campaign, and himself fought heroically in the Great War, can be sure of the loyalty of the French veterans who fought under him.

NFA_into_the_future_desc:0 "With de Gaulle's emergency government having finally stabilised France, the respected General is now preparing to announce free elections in France, after which a new Constitution can be drafted for the Kingdom. As the Orléans Monarchy was historically noted for its liberal tendencies, many within the Royal Family have responded enthusiastically, as have many nations on the world stage. However, it is unclear whether or not any organised opposition will appear, due to the extent of Maurras's purges of liberals."
NFA_liberal_success:0 "The Liberal Bloc"
NFA_liberal_success_desc:0 "Despite the persecution that French liberalism endured under the AF for so long, the remnants of the Parti Radical, Alliance Démocratique, and others besides, have been rallied by Bertrand de Jouvenel, a liberal thinker from an old aristocratic family, who has long sympathised with royalism, into a new French Liberal Front, which has astonished many by defeating de Gaulle in the elections. De Jouvenel promises a new liberalisation of the economy, and a system of checks and balances in what he sees as France's long tradition of liberalism."
NFA_new_political_configuration:0 "New Political Configuration"
NFA_new_political_configuration_desc:0 "De Jouvenel, despite being fundamentally a liberal, has always been attracted to "new" and radical elements of political thought, fuelling his interest in futurism, and he also makes no secret of the influence which both leftist and rightist radicals have had on his thought. De Jouvenel now promises to bring the French people into a bold new future. With a representative democracy and liberal economy, every citizen can secure the space needed to innovate and rise to the top. At the same time, some ideas from the left and right will be incorporated to ensure that individuals of all ideologies are having their concerns addressed."
NFA_balance_of_powers:0 "A Balance of Powers"
NFA_balance_of_powers_desc:0 "We cannot allow another inept strongman, such as Pétain, Maurras, or any of the Commune's assorted petty tyrants, to take hold of France again. The new Constitutional Monarchy must function on a basis of consensus, in which no branch of the state can hold sufficient power to establish a tyranny. The separate institutions of Monarchy, Parliament, Military, and Judiciary will all play their role in the State, and will all hold each other in place."
NFA_correct_statist_errors:0 "Economic Deregulation"
NFA_correct_statist_errors_desc:0 "For all too long, any number of disastrous economic policies, whether socialist or corporatist, have stifled the best talent that France can offer, and strangled ordinary citizens' ability to innovate and enrich both themselves and society as a whole. The various industries nationalised over the past years will be broken up and sold off, and red tape slashed, in order to stimulate a new innovative capitalist spirit in France."
NFA_market_responsibility:0 "Responsible Capitalism"
NFA_market_responsibility_desc:0 "Whatever the beliefs of the most radical members of the emerging free-market school of thought in France, we must not get swept away in our programme of economic liberalisation, and cannot forget where an overly lax attitude to economics leads. The state must keep closely in touch with the direction of the economy, even if it rarely intervenes, and it is essential to make sure that ordinary people are still sufficiently provided for."

NFA_legacy_of_july_monarchy_desc:0 "The main part of de Jouvenel's reforms are now completed, with economic prosperity reaching France through the free market, and the new liberal government having greatly succeeded in restoring France's trust among the global community. The nation can now rest easy, for under the sane and responsible guidance of its new democratic institutions, and under the unifying leadership of His Majesty, a new and glorious liberal era has dawned."
NFA_gaullists_hold_on:0 "Gaullist Continuity"
NFA_gaullists_hold_on_desc:0 "Few were surprised by the election results, which showed a clear victory for Charles de Gaulle and his National Royal Rally. De Gaulle now has genuine legitimacy for the first time since his coup, and has received a clear mandate from the people to steadily correct the errors of the Maurrassian government while stabilising the Kingdom and working towards economic prosperity for all."
NFA_centralise_power_in_the_crown:0 "Centralise Power in the Crown"
NFA_centralise_power_in_the_crown_desc:0 "The King still, at least nominally, retains the sweeping powers which he gained under the Maurrassian government, even if Maurras only gave him such powers to legitimize his own actions. Nonetheless, it would be a grave mistake to strip the Crown of these prerogatives too hastily, when de Gaulle can use these special powers, exercised through the institution of the Crown, to strengthen the French state, and further centralise it around his own rule."
NFA_control_local_governments:0 "Dominate Local Governments"
NFA_control_local_governments_desc:0 "It would be going too far to entirely abolish the Provincial governments set up by the AF, or to fully strip them of their powers, but we can ensure that they are loyal. By stepping in to promote friendly candidates in new local elections, and in extreme cases ensuring that elections go their way, we can guarantee that these governments toe de Gaulle's line, and steadily give up more powers to the central government."
NFA_necessity_of_intervention:0 "The Necessity of Intervention"
NFA_necessity_of_intervention_desc:0 "The AF was right in recognising that state intervention in the economy is needed to build harmony and cooperation between social classes, and de Gaulle can now expand upon earlier corporatist policies to ensure class solidarity. Meanwhile, we can also use this new increased state intervention to further centralise government power, by centrally managing the Corporate State from the Capital."
NFA_centralise_financial_planning:0 "Centralise Economic Planning"
NFA_centralise_financial_planning_desc:0 "Not only will a centrally controlled system of economic planning better preserve financial stability and class harmony, but it will also further correct the suicidal decentralisation of Maurras's government. As such, new sweeping powers will be granted to the national financial institutions in [NFA.Capital.GetName], to ensure that the economy is in safe hands."

At long last, de Gaulle's "certain idea" of this great nation is becoming a reality."
NFA_new_constitution:0 "Legacy of the July Monarchy"
NFA_new_constitution_desc:0 "From 1830 to 1848, France was a genuine Constitutional Monarchy, under the same House of Orléans that leads us today. Under the first Orléanist Kingdom, the economy was liberalised and industry advanced greatly, brilliant statesmen worked all too hard to build a secure place for France on the world stage, and the nation prospered in unity. That spirit must now be revived, with the government directly reminding people of its political predecessor, the July Monarchy."

NFA_dlr_victory_desc:0 "Today a new dawn rises over France. The Croix-de-Feu, once a minor militia with a few thousand members, now has total control over the French government. Seen as a rather moderate far right movement, its emphasis on Catholicism, corporatism, social harmony and more recently anti-semitism has made it more easy to stomach than other more severe far right parties like the AF. Now in charge of France, and with its leader closing in on his grave, the CdF must act fast if they are to leave a lasting legacy."

NFA_behead_the_red_snake_desc:0 "While we have reclaimed the Metropole, Syndicalists still harass our forces across the nation. If we are to secure ourselves in our homes once more, we must expunge this Red filth at the root. The Army will begin to aggressively chase the Syndicalist franc-tireur back to their holes and burn them out. It will be a long process, if not an excruciating one, but it must be done if stability is to last."
NFA_mass_membership_programme:0 "Mass Membership Programme"
NFA_mass_membership_programme_desc:0 "The CdF, for all its popularity, is rather small with just a few thousand actual members. This has left our regime particularly vulnerable to sabotage as we lack the cadres of loyal supporters enjoyed by most other parties. So to combat this we shall begin a massive recruitment drive to draw all those who want France free into our ranks. All across the nation posters, radio ads and pamphlets encouraging people to join the CdF are being put up, handed out or listened to. Already we have noticed recruitment going up by at least 90% compared to last year. De la Rocque is sure that that number will only grow."
NFA_immaculate_heart:0 "The Immaculate Heart"
NFA_immaculate_heart_desc:0 "Today the Head of State of the Papal States has landed in Paris to oversee a most ambitious ceremony. It's no secret that the CdF is a primarily and some would say zealously Catholic organization. As a Catholic organization overseeing a nation full of non-Catholics, what is to come may be seen by some as tasteless, out of touch or even offensive. Yet by consecrating all of France, both the Metropole and our former North African base, in the Immaculate Heart of Mary we not only pledge ourselves as Catholics to spread Jesus’s good word across the world, but we open the door to the rest of France to return to His light. As we gain in popularity those of little faith or no faith at all have turned more and more to the Catholic Church, swelling the numbers of Catholics and granting us God and His Son’s favor in our holy mission."
NFA_catholic_populist_ethos:0 "Catholic Populist Ethos"
NFA_catholic_populist_ethos_desc:0 "To many, Catholiscm and Populism are two sides of a coin. Populism usually entails grand reforms, earth quaking changes and an upending of the status quo while the Catholic Church usually wants none of that. However de la Rocque is one of a rare breed. He is a Catholic Populist. He sees God's love of humanity and interprets it as his want for us to strive to better ourselves and our situation. Even if that means that to do so we must go against His Church in some minor ways."
NFA_towards_social_harmony:0 "Towards Social Harmony"
NFA_towards_social_harmony_desc:0 "Whites, Blacks, Arabs, Jews, Christians of all kinds and Muslims call France home. Such diversity in a lesser nation would be a pressure cooker set to explode. However France, de la Rocque’s France, is not a pressure cooker. It is a special nation, ordained by God to further his vision. To do so however ethnic and religious tension cannot be abided by. That is why de la Rocque has begun to smooth out these potential conflict points. Some have criticized this move as he has routinely done so in favor of Christians when possible, and whites in general but their voices are in the minority. The people want peace and the CdF has given it to them."
NFA_find_dlr_successor:0 "Find a President Worthy of De La Rocque"
NFA_find_dlr_successor_desc:0 "Président François de la Rocque is dead. He had apparently been sickly for a long time but had kept it hidden from us. The added stress of the Presidency exacerbated his condition and now he is gone. Now the leaderless CdF is vulnerable, resistance to our rule has begun to crop up like weeds. We must find a strong leader if we are to survive the coming storm. Three men have thrown their hat in the ring to take over the Party. There is the nationalist Francois Mitterand, the populist Charles Vallin and the propagandist Francois Coty. Each one has wildly different views for how France should proceed and only one can see their dream come true."
NFA_coty:0 "François Coty"
NFA_coty_desc:0 "After much jostling and many underhanded moves Francois Coty has emerged as the undisputed leader of the Party and, by extension, of France. Demanding a rigid adherence to ideology and a devotion to the state along with a nationalist zeal he has been sometimes compared to Napoléon Bonaparte. This is probably helped by the fact that he comes from Corsica, just like Bonaparte. And just like Bonaparte Coty has a grand and illustrious vision for France. One that will last for a thousand years."
NFA_confront_masonic_influence:0 "Confront Masonic Influence"
NFA_confront_masonic_influence_desc:0 "While the Syndicalists are a known and present danger, an even worse danger lurks under the surface. The Masons, a nigh omnipotent organization seeks to pull strings in the shadows to further their nefarious aims. At least according to Coty. Coty seeks to cut those strings pulling at France and has issued Administrative Directive 12: On the Treatment of Masons. The Directive orders all governmental and judicial agencies to focus what efforts they can on weeding out the pervasive Masonic influence in France. Already dozens of raids are planned on Masonic lodges across the country and a whole list of Masonic leaders are under close and intense scrutiny. Some Masons have gotten the hint and have fled, the rest however will suffer the fate of all tyrants."
NFA_subordinate_the_party:0 "Subordinate the Party"
NFA_subordinate_the_party_desc:0 "While Coty is President of France and leader of the CdF Mitterand and Vallin’s cliques still present a danger to his continued rule. If France is to enjoy true stability then Vallin and Mitterand will be compelled to come out publicly and support Coty, something they have suspiciously refused to do. Meanwhile their seditious allies will be rounded up and jailed, unless they to swear allegiance to Coty of course. Some would decry this as a narcissistic grab for power but Coty knows better. France needs a strong leader if it is to survive. It needs one leader. It needs a Dictateur."
NFA_social_obligations_of_elite:0 "Social Obligations of the Elites"
NFA_social_obligations_of_elite_desc:0 "For too long the French upper crust has remained aloof and detached from the nation as a whole. When things went bad on the Metropole they were some of the first to flee to North Africa. If things went bad there too, no doubt they would be the first to flee to Canada. They have forgotten their raison d'être, to serve as an example. The upper classes will be taught that they are allowed to exist to be paragons of virtue, shining beacons of morality and devoted servants of the state, With the lower classes looking up to these model citizens, they too will be encouraged to fall in line."
NFA_republican_national_corporatism:0 "Republican National-Corporatism"
NFA_republican_national_corporatism_desc:0 "To many our new ideology of Republican National Coporatism is just a word soup. A confusing jumble of words with little to no actual meaning. However to Coty that ‘word soup’ contains the soul of a strong nation. Coty intends to use his connections he forged as the founder of L’Oreal to help wield corporations as they should be wielded. Not geared solely to enrich their owners, but to better the cause of the nation. They will work for the betterment of us all or, if they prove reluctant or refuse to conform, they will necessarily be nationalized. However, as a compromise the nation will also act in these corporations interests. With generous tax incentives and financial payouts, these businesses will be incentivized by more than just force to adhere to our national needs."
NFA_dominate_media:0 "Dominate Media"
NFA_dominate_media_desc:0 "In the past Coty bankrolled multiple newspapers like La Figaro and L’Ami du pepul. Both those newspapers are long gone, but the experience taught him valuable lessons in the power of a good newspaper. Now that he is in power he has decided that an independent media is too much of a threat. Should they turn against him then all of the CdF’s progress until now would be lost. So he has begun to nationalize and consolidate the various major newspapers into the Ministry of Current Affairs which acts as a holding company and censor to be sure that the media is kept on a short leash and only prints what Coty wants them to print."
NFA_modern_bonapartism:0 "Modern Bonapartism"
NFA_modern_bonapartism_desc:0 "Bonapartism is a term with many definitions but to Francois it has just one. While he does not support the enthroning of some petty exiled Prince, at least not anymore, he still believes in the use of a popular leader, confirmed by election and above party politics and partisan bickering who can use the full power of the State and religion to force through progress and change. Prince Louis is a relic of a bygone era, France has a new Bonaparte now and his name is Francois Coty."
NFA_corsican_favouritism:0 "Corsican Favoritism"
NFA_corsican_favouritism_desc:0 "During the retreat from the Metropole Coty was able to use the CdF on Corsica to crush the Syndicalist rising on the Island and secure it for the Republic. It was his home after all and he would be devastated to see the Syndicalists pollute it. Now that he is in charge and France is rising to higher heights, Coty sees no reason he can't use some extra funds to splurge a little bit on the homeland. Sure it's blatantly nepotistic but Coty has come up with a retroactive reason for his actions. Corsica is just 150 miles from Nice and served as an absolutely critical jumping off point for the Reclamation. All of this investment is just a repayment for diligent and faithful service to the nation as a whole. At least that’s what the press will say."
NFA_national_projects:0 "Projets Nationaux"
NFA_national_projects_desc:0 "The Projects Nationaux are a series of grand projects to rebuild our shattered homeland that would serve two uses. One would be the job creation aspect, such massive projects require men to do the work. Many factory workers still remain out of a job, or in a field they may not be explicitly trained for like service. By funding these massive projects we can stimulate industrial demand and create thousands of new construction jobs. Secondly these projects all have practical uses that are more self explanatory. However Coty sees them as a reason to be proud to be a Frenchman. Sure, pride in all of France’s historical accomplishments are good, but something concrete, like a building, serves as an anchor for nationalists to rally around. We can prove that as a Frenchman, we are capable of anything as long as we put our minds to it."
NFA_order_authority_hierarchy:0 "Order, Authority, Hierarchy"
NFA_order_authority_hierarchy_desc:0 "Ordre, autorité, hiérarchie, this is the phrase that has become the unofficial motto of Coty’s new France. Everybody knows their place and everybody knows their job. They work diligently and faithfully because they know that in the end, their hard work will be rewarded when the French Army, the true French Army, defeats its enemies both foreign and domestic. Meanwhile and at the same time they also maintain a vigilant watch for saboteurs, seditionists and Syndicalists who seek to export their poison and division to our new shores. All of this in the pursuit of that ultimate yet continually elusive goal, the perfect nation."
NFA_vallin:0 "Charles Vallin"
NFA_vallin_desc:0 "Today Charles Vallin, a friend of de la Rocque and the establishment candidate to succeed him, has edged out his rivals. He has used his long standing connections and already broad power base to sideline Mitterand and Coty and has assumed unquestioned control over the CdF and France as a whole.Seeking to make the CdF a mass movement, his lower class appeal helped him gain edge out over his opponents. Some allege that he will repay his working class supporters with a drive to lessen the restrictions on them. This has been brushed off as fanciful by Vallin. As the establishment candidate it seems more likely that he will continue France on the path set out for it by de la Rocque. A strong executive backed up by a subordinate industry and press seem to be his goals."
NFA_steady_continuity:0 "Steady Continuity"
NFA_steady_continuity_desc:0 "The battle for control between the triumvirate was a messy affair. Many poisonous remarks were uttered and the three factions are reluctant to trust one another. Vallin seeks to put this conflict behind him and restore the status quo as it was before. To do that he shall begin to emphasize the fact that de la Rocque actually preferred him over Coty or Mitterand. Whether he did or not is not entirely known but sufficient documentation has been created to present a convincing case. The Martyred President is still beloved by the rank and file of the Party. If they find out he wanted Vallin, they will want him too."
NFA_commit_to_mass_politics:0 "Commit to Mass Politics"
NFA_commit_to_mass_politics_desc:0 "Until now the CdF has not been a true mass movement. Sure we have a wide appeal and many members from all levels of society but we never tried to capture the power of The People as a political force. That is, until now. Under Vallin the CdF shall begin to hold rallies that are just as much advertisements as they are rallies. Flashy marches, grand ceremonies, illustrious parade grounds all will become staples of official party functions. With the people on our side we could do anything we put our mind to and the people will eagerly follow us into Hell if we direct them to."

Their passion can be stoked into a raging inferno and if taught the right things early enough, they will be lifelong Party members. Not only that but they are the next generation! We must care for them so the next generation of Frenchmen will be stronger than the last! So we shall encourage them to join the newly established Federation of French Scouting. There they will learn to appreciate the outdoors and be taught practicable skills related to hiking and camping. Through this newfound vitality they will grow into strong and loyal Frenchmen, ready to defend the land they love so dearly."

The Word of God has been used and twisted by demons since time began for their own nefarious aims. However, for all the demons twisting God's Word into poison, there are more angels using it to justify acts of kindness and charity as spelled out in the Bible. To make Christianity more palpable to those it has most affected, we will put these words of kindness into action. Government charity in the name of Christ will help to raise the standard of living for those most disenfranchised. At the same time it will rehabilitate God in the eyes of those who were chased away."

Villain is aware of this so he has decided that the best course of action is limited reform. We won't give up the reins of power entirely, but giving more freedoms to the people may calm them long enough for our state to smother the embers of rebellion.

Some of these, like limits to freedoms of press, assembly and speech, are incredibly controversial. Our more hardline members warn that relaxing these restrictions is the first step towards revolution. However they are just doomsayers. All of these protesters and rabble rousers are simply desperate people looking for a new way to live.

This charter serves as a new contract between business and labour to bring about a new age of social harmony between them and muffle any prospective Syndicalist taint from destabilizing our state at its foundations. For labour includes a pay ladder for just about every industry with regular, notably sized raises based on the quality and length of service at any given business. Not only that but workplace safety is also given a new government agency to enforce it. For businesses the government will give them tax breaks based on their compliance to government regulations and reward them in other ways for worker retention rates.

Labour and Management work together to iron out their differences, keeping industrial disruptions to an absolute minimum and keeping the economy chugging along better than ever before. Politically, at the top of the power pyramid, sits the Presidency. Sometimes now described as an ‘Imperial Presidency’ the office is now imbued with a power unseen in French history and arguably closer to that of a dictator than pre-War France. He has near total control of state policy with the legislative and judicial branches reduced to near irrelevancy, acting more as advisory boards rather than real checks on Presidential power. Some say this is a dictatorship in all but name and that French democracy is dead. Vallin however knows better. French democracy, fractious and precarious as it was, is now solidified. WIth a powerful President able to trump over any of the petty disagreements that once paralyzed the government so often the allure of dictatorship will no longer sway men’s hearts."

The temptations of power kept the kleptocrats from truly living up to their lofty ideals. That is not so in this new France. In this new France the people and the President work together to further the interests of France. The people call for change and they are confident that their President will implement that change. Meanwhile the President can be sure that the people will support him in his efforts, giving him the political weight to throw around and bend the rigid political system to his own will. Some fear this may lead to problems down the line, if the people’s will becomes more radical for instance. However Vallin is not worried. The people are well indoctrinated into the CdF’s ideals.

Promising a ‘Revolutionary New Movement’ Mitterand has a suitably ambitious agenda typical of his youth. He wants to bind the nation closer together, led by the zealous youth into a future of endless possibilities.

Leaders will be required to complete monthly tests of workplace competency where they will have to do the jobs they oversee for some amount of time. If at any time they are deemed unable to complete their jobs they will be replaced. Not only will this end the threat of workplace complacency it will keep bosses involved in the actual function of the workplace and keep the bosses and workers on the same level.

We must remedy this if France is to survive any trials that may lay ahead. To do this the Government will establish a series of fraternal brotherhoods across the nation. This will serve not only as a social opportunity for people to meet people and grow closer to their community, it will also close the growing chasm between those who fled with us to North Africa and those who stayed under the Syndicalist yoke.

We shall lionize the men of yesteryear and remind all of France of just what the state will require of them in the future. By giving the men and children of today a new ideal to live up to they will surely strive to meet it. This new ideal, being a soldier, would also reasonably lead more men into the military.

That is why Mitterrand has instructed all government institutions to begin stoking nationalist fires in the hearts of everybody through a thorough propaganda campaign not seen since the starting days of the CdF’s rule. Everywhere people will see posters lionizing the illustrious history of France, hear Party men giving speeches on the superiority of French civilization and have various French scientific organizations publish their new findings discovering the racial superiority of the French as well. That last one is the most tenuous and Mitterrand himself is hesitant on pushing it too much. We just have to see how well the French public take it."

By demanding legally binding public oaths of loyalty from every citizen if they wish to have any dealings with or work with the government we will ensure that all Frenchmen are loyal to the state.

Its all Mitterrand can do to keep them from starting a second People's Crusade against them, with more than likely similar results.

NFA_end_the_parlementary_republic_desc:0 "De La Rocque is a man of history. He has seen the fruits of our parliamentary democracy. He knows of the endless cycle of revolution, corruption and revolution that our nation has been stuck in since the beginning of this farce the politicians insist on calling democracy. However, there is a better way. Examples have shown that a nation with a strong executive will be stable. America and Russia, despite recent instability, have had long histories of stability due to their powerful executives. By emulating it here in France we will finally know peace. Since the President and Parliament are on a tight leash, its just a matter of writing the bill."

NFA_bring_WW2_veterans_to_our_side_desc:0 "The CdF is made up of mostly men from the First Weltkrieg and the Revolution, along with their sons and proteges. These men, forged in the fires of the most horrendous war our species has ever seen, proved to be a good foundation. However, after the Second Weltkrieg France is now full of angry men of action. Veterans, once hailed as heroes, now lurk in alleys and bars, feeling forgotten and disgraced. However, by drawing them into our organization we can give them purpose once more. Besides, their often violent hatred of Syndicalism and military training will make them able attack dogs to keep the Red Menace at bay."

As far as we know he hasn’t said anything much about us. However, if we are to cement our rule we must gain his support.

NFA_reaffirm_church_place_desc:0 "France has always had a close relationship with the Church, ever since the days of Charlemagne. We shall reaffirm this closeness and give the Church more privileges.

People will know their place, like women who will take up their natural jobs as homemakers and men who will go out and work hard for their pay and children who will act as the bricks raising our state ever higher. However, we will not be needlessly cruel. Hard times come for us all, its a simple fact of life. That is why every patriotic citizen who, for one reason or another, may fall on hard times will be allowed government support. Of course there will be restrictions. We cannot have anybody living their lives on the government’s dime with no want to earn for themselves."

NFA_people_corporatism:0 "People's Corporatism"
NFA_people_corporatism_desc:0 "The Free Market is a fickle thing. One wrong move by some idiot in Marseilles could cause a hundred businesses in Calais to go under. We cannot hedge our bets on something left so much to chance. That is why we shall reform the economy along corporatist lines. By having the economy be controlled by groups of businesses they can make what decisions must be made for the prosperity of us all without having to worry about how that would affect the chain seven links down."
NFA_fourth_republic:0 "La Quatrième République"
NFA_fourth_republic_desc:0 "In the ashes of the Third Republic, a new and stronger Republic, the Fourth Republic, has risen. Led by a powerful and righteous executive this Republic will not fall prey to the fickle whims of the people. He will have the power to do what must be done to save the nation, popular opinion be damned. Some still mourn the death of Parliamentarism but these short-sighted fools will come around to the greatness of cause when our men, unburdened by the conflicting ideas of Parliament and united behind their President, march through Berlin and hang the Kaiser from a lamp post!"

NFA_AF_Victory:0 "L'Impossible Restauration..."
NFA_AF_Victory_desc:0 "In a lightning bolt of a political development Charles Maurras and his Restorationist Action Francaise have been elected to lead the nation. Espousing a vehement hatred of democracy and a love of King, God and Country, few expected him to get anywhere. Yet, Maurras is now Prime Minister of France. However there is little real danger of him restoring the King, the Army and Nation are too far into Democracy to allow it. Yet he can do a lot to change the Republic without restoring the Monarch."
NFA_royal_presidency:0 "A Royal Presidency"
NFA_royal_presidency_desc:0 "The Presidency is already rather powerless and we must strip him of his powers further. However, as a compromise his term shall be extended to seven years.

NFA_from_syndicalism_to_corporatism_desc:0 "While liberals may stress the importance of individual rights in an economy we shall stress the importance of seeing the whole effect of your actions before you make them. We cannot allow for one many fickle wills to be the downfall of us all. So, we shall make sure that the economy will work as a whole to better itself."
NFA_thiers_mistake:0 "The Mistakes of Thiers"
NFA_thiers_mistake_desc:0 "In 1872 loyal friend of the King Adolphe Theirs gave a speech where he betrayed the one and true King of France and threw his lot in with the Republicans. This brought down the July Monarchy and plunged France into nearly a century of turmoil. This betrayal however was not shocking. We knew from the start that only we know what is best for France. We cannot compromise with traitorous rabble, even those who deign to call themselves ‘Conservative’."
NFA_town_down_rhetoric:0 "Temper our Rhetoric"
NFA_town_down_rhetoric_desc:0 "Of course to throw out Republicanism entirely is out of the question. The Army is Republican to the core unfortunately and if they see us as trying to restore a Monarch then they would remove us from power without a second thought. So, unfortunately compromise shall become our chosen King. We will pull back on some of the harshest rhetoric and reign in the more zealous among us to keep the Army happy and our heads on our shoulders."
NFA_moderate_camelots:0 "The Moderates Camelots"
NFA_moderate_camelots_desc:0 "The Camelots are our paramilitary. Until now they have acted, of course totally without orders, as you might expect a paramilitary for an anti-semitic monarchist organization would. Beatings of Republicans and of Jews fill the daily newspapers and anger is rising in turn. Nobody believes our insistence that they are acting of their own accord and lay all these instances at our feet. To keep the people from revolting we must reign in the Camelots and moderate their stances. It might just kill the organization, but it's better than the organization killing us."
NFA_mcmahon_legacy:0 "MacMahon's Legacy"
NFA_mcmahon_legacy_desc:0 "Patrice de Mac-Mahon was a true French patriot. Serving with Napoléon at Sedan in 1870 he was captured but released just in time to crush the First Commune that rose soon after in Paris. Afterwards, as President, he served as a traditionalist and neutral guardian of the Constitution who rightly despised Republican idiocy, but recognized the impossibility of restoring a King. He did at least, until the Republicans forced him from office. We act in his giant shadow and we must honor him as we do any of the many patriots from French history."
NFA_decentralise_the_republic:0 "Decentralise the Republic"
NFA_decentralise_the_republic_desc:0 "Centralizing all power in Paris is a recipe for disaster. Doing so would only beg for some demagogue to come to power just like the Commune did. Not to mention we are stronger in the Provinces. Cities are hives of liberal ideals and Republican fervor. By giving power to the provinces we reward our base and win over more provincials to our side. All of France shall rise behind us and the cities shall learn that the borders of France do not end at the borders of Paris."
NFA_end_to_secularism:0 "An End to Secularism"
NFA_end_to_secularism_desc:0 "The Church is a keystone to any successful French state. With god on our side, anything can be accomplished. While in exile the borders between church and state grew very thin, yet they still exist. Any wannabe Revolutionary could solidify them with the flick of a pen. We must act now to tear down these artificial barriers and bring the men of God into lock step with the Government. Marching in time with the Church nobody could stand against us!"
NFA_reaffirm_local_cultures:0 "Reaffirm Local Cultures"
NFA_reaffirm_local_cultures_desc:0 "We are all Frenchmen yes, but we are not all only Frenchmen. France is a large nation and as such there are dozens of unique and special regional differences. A man from Brittany is very much unlike his brothers from Corsica. We shall enshrine protections for these local cultures into the Constitutional Law of the Land and protect the rich and vibrant cultural heritage of France, the greatest nation in the World!"
NFA_republique_organique:0 "La République Organique"
NFA_republique_organique_desc:0 "Against all odds, in the midst of Republican treachery and Army dissension, we have made an Integralist Republic. While we still cannot restore the King like we want, we are well on our way to changing minds. The prosperity and peace we have brought swell our ranks like a mighty tsunami. It may not be in our lifetime, or in our children's lifetime, but eventually this wave shall crash down on the rickety structure of this so-called Republic and bring it down, letting God's true Chosen lead us to a golden age without end! That however is for the future. Now, however, there is work to be done."

Exiled with all the other former reigning families by French law passed in 1886, his family fled to England shortly after his birth, before fleeing further to Switzerland after the British revolution. Since 1926, Louis has been the head of the Bonaparte family, though he only assumed full authority over the Bonapartists in 1935. This allowed him to join the French army, where he quickly rose through the ranks during the war thanks to his heroic deeds. Since 1926, Louis has been the head of the Bonaparte family, though he only assumed full authority over the Bonapartists in 1935. Close to Fédération Républicaine, with whom he shares a conception of democratic rule with a conservative outlook, he has nonetheless been elected president as a neutral war hero. Some committed Republicans scoff at the idea of a new militarist, and moreover a Bonaparte, as head of state.\n\nLouis Bonaparte has nonetheless been a popular President thus far. Having assured the public that he would not repeat the modus operandi of his ancestors, he asserts himself as a proud and convinced Republican."
POLITICS_FRANCOIS_DE_LA_ROCQUE_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, François de La Rocque, commonly referred to as simply “the Colonel”, has accomplished a brilliant military and political career. An alumnus of Saint-Cyr, he was grievously wounded during the Great War, was mentioned in dispatches nine times and became at thirty-three one of the youngest commanding officers in the French armed forces, receiving the Légion d'Honneur for military valour in 1916. A patriot and pious Catholic, he remained loyal to the government as the revolution broke out. After the exile he joined the Croix-de-Feu, a veterans group that quickly attracted tens of thousands of veterans who hoped to revive the spirit of comradeship of the trenches and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming its president in 1931. Roque is a supporter of democracy and the Republic, though he prefers a strong rule, scarred by the infamous parliamentary instability of the Third Republic. Having taken the lead of the Croix-de-Feu in the early 1930s, the party quickly grew exponentially, becoming the first mass party in French politics, all devoted to the Colonel and his hope of a reformed Republic.\n\nAfter having been Prime Minister under the old Marshal, De la Rocque finally succeeded in ascending to the Presidency himself, a position that was once devoid of power, but now all-powerful thanks to De la Rocque's vision."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_IV_DESC:0 "Born in 1914 in exile, along with his entire family since the fall of the Second Empire, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte had known nothing but flight since his earliest days. Born in Belgium his family fled to England shortly after he was born, then fled to Switzerland after England fell to the fires of Syndicalist tyranny. When he was old enough, inspired to a devoted love of a home country he had not even seen much less lived in, Louis Napoléon joined the Foreign Legion under the false identity of Louis Blanchard. However, being the head of the Bonaparte family since 1926 had brought him a certain degree of notoriety so it was not long before many within National France recognized this new Blanchard for who he really was. While the French government initially intended to drum him out of the Legion and into exile, with some ministers even wanting to classify him an enemy of the state, he quickly gained fame as a war hero. His unit was involved with many dangerous missions against native rebels in the Sahara and Louis distinguished himself multiple times through his actions taking no less than five wounds. With a few more medals pinned to his chest and having bled for France more readily than most others, the government soon found their hands tied.\n\nAfterwards he began to, according to him unintentionally, inflame the seemingly dead Bonapartist movement in the French Right. While the AF wanted a stuffy aristocrat to be a stuffy aristocratic King, the Bonapartists championed Louis as a true heir to Napoléon The Great, a war hero and man of the people.\n\nHowever, now Emperor, his outspoken support of democracy and open alliance with the Republican-Socialists and notably Paul Painlevé has made the Jeunesse Patriotes of Pierre Taittinger, his main backers, and other Nationalist and Bonapartist factions, wary of him. Now, through hook or by crook, Louis Napoléon finds himself as the leader of France surrounded by enemies on all sides. Many are already drawing parallels with Napoléon I’s situation and Louis-Napoléon's. It remains to be seen if Louis can live up to the magnificent example set by his ancestor, or even surpass it, albeit with his own, democratic, ways."

In exile, a  man of the moderate left, he was seen with suspicion despite his opposition to revolutionary socialism, especially as he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical, so recently divided as its left-wing joined the socialists in revolt. He fiercely defended the primacy of parliament against Marshal Pétain’s creeping encroachment, which earned him the praise of the few remaining committed democrats and the nickname “the Bull of Vaucluse” for his pugnacity.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, the new Union Sacrée.

POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, a lawyer by trade, Paul Reynaud was young enough to be mobilised in 1914 and fight in every major engagement of the Great War, even being dispatched to Russia to assist the White forces in 1918. After the defeat, a man of the moderate right, thoroughly committed to economic liberalism, he joined the ranks of the Alliance Démocratique, revealing himself to be a captivating orator and fierce political animal in the chaos of exile. When Marshal Pétain and his supporters formed an emergency government, he begrudgingly accepted the new status quo, but never wavered in his commitment to his ideals of liberal, democratic Republic. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives.\n\nWith democracy restored, Reynaud is hard at work to restore the spirit of the Republic, deeply damaged by the defeat and the junta. Very active in his Prime Minister role, he hopes to implement his unorthodox economic ideas, shying away from the free-market economics previously embraced in favour of light dirigisme, making him somewhat more amenable to the PSF."

Born into a bourgeois family of Radical politicians, a lawyer by trade, a prominent Freemason, committed to economic and political liberalism as well parliamentary supremacy, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical following the exile, appreciated for his fierce denunciations of the breakaway left-wing of the party, and willingness to compromise with his opponents. He was among those who actively defended a return to normal democratic life following the bid of Marshal Pétain for power but quickly found himself somewhat isolated. Indeed, his Freemason links worked against him, as he was given the nickname of “Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret” by right-wing newspapers, accused of working in concert with the left-wing of the Radical party still active in the Commune.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain, though he was not called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, he remained active in the party. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as Prime Minister. He hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1889, Pierre-Étienne Flandin is a lawyer by trade, but as the son of a politician, he was naturally predisposed to following in his footsteps. Elected to parliament at only 25, his burgeoning career was cut short by the Great War during which he served with distinction as a balloon observer. There was born his speciality: advocacy for aeronautical development, and precise technical knowledge. Indeed, Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British. A man of the moderate right, he joined the Alliance Démocratique. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives. His skills as a knowledgeable technician have made him indispensable in parliamentary commissions, his advice sought after by the government and across political lines.\n\nIn short, he is an unassuming but unifying figure within Parliament, and as such he was asked to be part of the Government of National Unity after the fall of Marshal Pétain. With the coalition surviving, to the surprise of many, he was the natural compromise between the right and the left. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed regime, parliamentary and liberal."
POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1856, by 1914 Philippe Pétain was on his way towards retirement after a discreet and honourable career as innovative military theorist and professor at the École de Guerre. The Great War destroyed any hope of a quiet retirement, however: from the early days of the war, he distinguished himself as a capable and charismatic leader of men, appreciated by his troops to whom he showed paternal care and quickly shot up the ranks, replacing officers who had failed in Belgium and northern France. Then came Verdun, where he issued his iconic order: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, granting him national fame. His care for proper logistics and morale contributed heavily to the victory, and from then on he was “the Lion of Verdun”. Emboldened by his successes and having earned the respect of the many men that served under him, he was able to restore order during the mutinous mood of 1916, and when the front broke between British and French armies at Amiens in 1918, he was the one who succeeded Supreme Commander Foch and stabilised the front. It was his ideas that permitted the successful counter-attacks, his presence that prevented wider mutiny from occurring. This sadly was not enough to prevent defeat.\n\nAmidst the chaos of the civil war and exile, Pétain held on to his career, and his role in the successful evacuation of the loyalist forces to Algiers earned him much admiration. Nonetheless, it would be his old superior Ferdinand Foch, not him, who would assume control some months later in a bloodless putsch. Undaunted, Pétain came to be a firm supporter of the new junta, sharing many of his countrymen's belief that a responsible military government would prove to be a unifying force, and get the nation into shape for a future liberation.\nThen, when Foch passed away in 1929, it was Pétain who was destined to fill his shoes, assuming control of the junta largely unchallenged. Since then, he has worked tirelessly to build alliances with both the Croix de Feu and centre-right parties, and has been happy to delegate responsibilities to the Assembly and to civilian politicians when necessary. Nevertheless, he has no intention of doing away with the junta entirely, something which is sure to create tension as time goes by.\nFor now, however, it is Pétain and Pétain alone who is at the helm of France, and the Lion of Verdun bravely roars from the sands of Africa, with but one hope: that one day, he might be laid to rest in the soil of Verdun, alongside the valiant men who he is proud to have led."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle, a staunch Catholic would enter the military academy of Saint-Cyr in 1910 and would prove a capable student, graduating 13th in his class in 1912, joining the 33rd infantry regiment of infantry under the orders of then Colonel Pétain. De Gaulle would enter the Great War as a first lieutenant, and the 33rd regiment would see action very early on at Dinant. At Dinant he would be thrown right into the fire and was one of the first to be wounded, taking a bullet to the knee. While recovering he wrote about the shortcomings of the French officer staff and how slow he felt the British troops were. He would rejoin his regiment and by December he became a regimental adjutant. His unit became well known for sneaking through No Man’s Land to listen in on enemy conversations, and for this de Gaulle would be awarded the Croix de Guerre in January of 1915. Another injury in March would take him out of the fighting for four months, and by September he became captain of the 10th company. In the Battle of Verdun, de Gaulle would take a bayonet in the thigh and be captured as a result.\n\nHe would spend the next few months in German captivity. During this time, he read German newspapers, wrote his first book, and eventually escaped. De Gaulle was granted a hero’s welcome when he returned, becoming a symbol of French defiance against the Germans. He would go home to his family but would not be at peace due to the Revolution. De Gaulle and his family would follow the government in exile to Algiers, where he would join loyalist officers.\n\nHe has become famous in exile as a military lecturer and theorist and is a close associate of Marshal Pétain. After having been his right hand man, De Gaulle now leads France following the withdrawal of his mentor, he now intends to lead a new France with a strong executive, and does not hide his monarchist tendencies."
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Born in 1874, Jean d’Orléans was for long a picture of aristocratic aloofness. He was, after all, far down the line of succession of the House of France. Barred from service in the French army, he joined the Danish army for some time, as the king Valdemar was his brother-in-law, before eventually settling in Morocco hoping to promote French interests in the region. The Great War would, however, transform him: once again barred from joining the armies of the Republic, he joined the Medical Service of the Red Cross, transforming his French chateau into a hospital and personally taking care of the wounded. Though initially hardly interested in politics, the defeat and break out of the revolution would further convince him of the need for deep reform, bringing him closer to the Action Française. In 1924, following the death of his cousin Philippe d’Orléans without an heir, he was acclaimed by royalists as the rightful pretender to the throne of France. In exile in now German Morocco, he would continue the cooperation with the Integralists started by his predecessors. Royalist efforts were now entirely concentrated around the AF, particularly as the Catholic hierarchy went past their issues with the movement, deeply shocked by the anticlerical violence of the syndicalist revolution. In 1933, he issued a manifesto calling for a “royal government” to save France, instead of a “government of parties”, a clear shot at Pétain’s regime: this would further enhance his political profile in a France-in-exile where the prestige of the Republic was at its lowest and the Marshal’s junta was rapidly losing support.\n\nWith the triumph of Charles Maurras against democratic and reformist forces, few were surprised that the new head of state called for a restoration of the monarchy. King Jean III now leads France as it struggles to purge the remnants of the Republic from the nation, and prepares her, the Eldest Daughter of the Church, to the holiest of struggles, a crusade to reconquer the métropole from the Reds."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Born in 1908, young Henri d’Orléans has known exile his whole life. He lived a carefree early childhood on his father’s property in Morocco, where he was found to be a particularly bright child, curious and caring of the various workers of the vast plantation, quickly becoming fluent in French, Arabic, English, German, Italian and Spanish. Soon, however, he would be with his father in his chateau-hospital, being exposed to the horrors of war, before having to flee from the wrath of the revolutionaries. This incident would prove deeply traumatic for Henri, sowing the seeds of a later political awakening. Back in Morocco, he was tutored by the best European tutors, who would introduce him to Integralist thought, which resonated deeply with the youth: not just in its deeply reactionary rhetoric, but most particularly in its advocacy of strict adherence to the Social Doctrine of the Church and economic reform along with corporatist thought. Furthering his studies in Belgium, he discovered for the first time the crowded housing, poor working conditions and terrible anonymity of the lives of the European working poor, as he was attending to their needs as part of Catholic charity efforts. When his father became the head of the House of France in 1924, he became its Dauphin, immediately surrounded by advisors who sought to shape the young man into a worthy King of France. As heir presumptive, now banned from France, the dashing Dauphin nevertheless fully dedicated himself to the royalist cause, working closely with the Action Française despite his personal enmity towards Charles Maurras, as he could recognise that the growing movement was the best chance for restoration of the monarchy. His marriage to his cousin Isabelle de Orléans e Bragança in 1931, and the birth of their son Henri in 1933 created further enthusiasm among royalists: the future of the House of France secured.\n\nOften making discreet trips across the border from Morocco to meet with royalist leaders such as Charles Maurras, Henri was instrumental in the struggle that led to the restoration of the monarchy. In the early years of the renewed kingdom, he assisted his ageing father in every way and was often seen as the real power behind the throne, attempting to outmanoeuvre the Action Française about as often as he worked with them. Now in power, King Henri hopes to continue the rebirth of France, to build a monarchy that will last for another thousand years."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_DARNAND_DESC:0 "Joseph Darnand is seemingly a natural leader. He was born into a middle class family in Coligny, near the Swiss border. In 1916 he joined the French Army to fight the Boche. In April of 1917 he was made a corporal and by the end of the war he would be an adjutant warrant officer. However, along with his rank Darnand also gained fame for his bravery and daring. He would lead his small squad of men in daring but extremely dangerous infiltration missions. As the French Army began to disintegrate Darnand gained the attention of the government, sorely lacking in propaganda opportunities, who would give him many medals and make him a war hero.\n\nHowever, when the War ended and France descended into Civil  War, Darnand lost the spotlight. This irked him but he still fought with the tenacity and bravery he showed against the Germans, just against his own countrymen. It was during this time he began to show a rabid hatred of Syndicalism. He took to shooting any prisoners he took and, according to testimony from former squadmates, seemed to enjoy it. For all his efforts the Syndicalists still won the War, and Darnand was one of the last men to leave France after volunteering to serve in the rear guard fighting around Nice. When in North Africa he was demobilized, along with hundreds of thousands of bitter veterans, and fell into the veteran dominated Right Clubs.\n\nHe bounced between Action Francaise, La Cagoule and the Croix-de-Feu before coming to the realization that they were not radical enough. Darnand came to realize that it wasn't just Syndicalism that was a poison, but foreigners, Jews, Masons and Muslims were also, as he called them, sous-homme, sub-human. He left the Croix-de-Feu in the early 1930s and founded his own militia, the Chevaliers du Glaive. As a rabidly anti-everything militant he initially attracted little attention and few followers. However a clever mind and steely determination led to Darnand crawling his way into power. Now at the zenith of his rise he has all of France before him and he has some particularly radical ideas on what to do with it."
POLITICS_MARCEL_LEFEBVRE_DESC:0 "Not all men can be priests, very few can be bishops and almost none can be Pope, yet some men are seemingly born to be just that. On November 29th, 1905, Pius XII, or as the world knew him, Marcel Lefebvre, was born to René and Gabrielle Lefebvre. An industrialist and devoted Monarchist, Lefebvre's father was convinced that the only way that France would once more turn to Christendom was if her monarchy was restored. In November of 1919, with the war lost, the French Revolution began, the Lefebvre were able to sneak past the lines, and began making their way towards Marseille. It was during their travels in secret that the young Marcel saw the destruction and demonic waste that follows in Revolution's footsteps, helping him forge the basis of his ardent antisocialist stances. Upon arriving in Marseille, the Lefebvres would find themselves as one of many families that were fleeing Revolutionary terror.\n\nA few years after arriving in exile, Marcel began his studies for Priesthood. Pressured by his father, the future Pius XII studied in Rome, eventually being ordained to the Priesthood by Achille Liénart in 1929. Upon becoming a priest, Marcel would join the Holy Ghost Fathers, eventually coming to lead the CSSp's missionary activities within Gabon. In his albeit brief tenure, Father Lefebvre displaced a radical traditionalism that would make even the most conservative of Bishops blush. Claiming his traditionalism stemmed from his seminary teacher Henri Le Floch, eventually he would be recalled to Algiers, after he called a seminarian who belonged to a prominent family. Calling the seminarian a modernist, his family pulled some strings and had Lefebvre placed on 'temporary leave of absence.' Upon returning to Algiers, the young priest found the city ablaze with religious fervor, as Grandmaster Joseph Darnand had just condemned the Papacy as run by Freemasons, and declared the opening of new Conclave to elect a true successor to the late Pius XI. Due to being a somewhat prominent figure within French cleric circles, most especially within traditionalist ones, Father Lefebvre was invited to take part in the Conclave. After a highly secretive process, Marcel Lefebvre, against all expectations, was elected as the Bishop of Rome, the first non cardinal to be elected in almost 800 years. As pope, Pius XII, a name he took to honor the late Pius XI, has seemingly been the most traditionalist pope in perhaps the entire history of the Church. With him finally elevated to a position of power after years of exile, the Church will never be the same, as Freemasonic Modernism is replaced by Legionary Traditionalism. May God forgive those who stood against him, for no one else will."

#Initial Ideas
NFA_anti_communard:0 "Anti-Communard"
NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "After our defeat in the Weltkrieg of 1919, the communards rose up again and abolished our cherished Republic. Luckily, some of the most important figures of the Republic have immigrated to Algeria where they plan to organise the counter-revolution. Now that the syndicalist traitors have taken full control of the mainland, we must crush them! We must ensure that our Eternal France will always be free!"

NFA_native_unrest_2:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_native_unrest_2_desc:0 "The Code of the Indiginate remains in place since its creation in 1887. A diverse set of laws and regulations imposed on the native populations of the empire, they enshrine their inferior legal status despite them being technically French citizens. Collective punishment, a parallel justice system, forced labour and service in the armed forces, enforced by native elites under the guise of modernisation and spread of civilisation: to say that the Indigénat has created resentment would be an understatement. However it has proved to be a sure source of labour for the colonial effort and is supported by many prominent voices in government who argue that maintaining this status quo is necessary to prepare for the Reconquest."

NFA_internal_unrest:0 "Simmering Discontent"
NFA_internal_unrest_desc:0 "Years of inaction and political stagnation have caused many elements within the army and the population to become dissatisfied with the current regime, something hardly helped by Maurice Janin's repeated blunders. This has extensively played into the hands of both resurgent liberal parties and the far-right Leagues. Although it is suppressed, contestation is slowly but surely growing within the French Republic."

#protests and Petain ideas 
NFA_protests:0 "Widespread Protests"
NFA_protests_desc:0 "The exposure of Janin's corruption has provoked widespread protests against the regime. Almost every Frenchman has some grievance with the junta, whether he opposes the Republic, the dictatorship, or indeed Pétain's failure to fully assert his power, and this bottled-up resentment has now spilled over. Something will need to change if the regime is to live on."
NFA_prestige_of_verdun:0 "Prestige of Verdun"
NFA_prestige_of_verdun_desc:0 "It was the Battle of Verdun in 1916 which first made Pétain a hero to the nation, and the French people have never forgotten his defence of the nation. By reviving and encouraging these memories, the junta is seeking to revive its popularity."
NFA_liberation_priority:0 "Liberation Priority"

NFA_chantiers_de_la_jeunesse_desc:0 "In order to bolster its popularity, the military junta has instituted a system of "workshops", or camps, at which young men approaching adulthood will stay for a few months, to learn physical fitness and moral values. "
NFA_dictatorship_of_morals:0 "Dictatorship of Morals"
NFA_dictatorship_of_morals_desc:0 "By deepening its ties with the Catholic Church and distancing itself from the old liberal secularism of the Republic, the junta has managed to portray itself as a mora, and conservative government, rallying much of the French right behind it."
NFA_revolution_nationale:0 "Révolution Nationale"
NFA_revolution_nationale_desc:0 "Pétain has doubled down on his traditionalist policies, proclaiming a "national revolution" against the old liberal-democratic institutions of the Republic, and against the Communards. Supported by conservatives and more radical rightwingers, this counter-revolutionary ideology will likely dominate French politics for years."
NFA_crusade_for_the_metropole:0 "Crusade for the Métropole"
NFA_crusade_for_the_metropole_desc:0 "Pétain's regime has expanded further on its determination to liberate France, seeking to mass-mobilise French society and the economy, and to deepen citizens' enthusiasm for militarism and the liberation, and reminding them of their compatriots' struggle under socialist tyranny."
NFA_strengthened_intelligence:0 "Expanded Deuxieme Bureau"
NFA_strengthened_intelligence_desc:0 "In order to further infiltrate the Commune in anticipation of the liberation, and in order to monitor and combat dissent at home, Pétain has granted sweeping powers and extensive funds to the nation's intelligence service, the Deuxieme Bureau."

NFA_the_roar_of_the_lion_desc:0 "With Republican liberalism swept away, and French society militarised and mobilised towards the liberation effort, Pétain has finally secured power at home, and now gazes abroad.

NFA_localist_laws:0 "Localist Legal System"
NFA_localist_laws_desc:0 "Although the exile makes it hard to truly implement Maurras's principles of local autonomy, we have nonetheless laid the legal framework for a decentralised state, in anticipation of the liberation. Meanwhile, Maurras has taken the opportunity to extend localist policies to the natives in Africa, to bolster their acceptance of French rule and loyalty to the King."
NFA_traditionalist_culture:0 "Traditionalist Culture"
NFA_traditionalist_culture_desc:0 "Seeking to uphold Maurras's traditionalist ideal of Latin civilisation and classicism, the AF government is seeking to remould French culture, rejecting modernity and romanticism."
NFA_liberty_under_the_king:0 "Liberty Under the Crown"
NFA_liberty_under_the_king_desc:0 "The AF regime, despite being a dictatorship by all accounts, sees itself as rejecting totalitarianism and tyranny, with which it associates the Commune, and instead sees its regionalism and traditionalism as guaranteeing true freedom for the French people."
NFA_cult_of_jeanne_darc:0 "The Cult of Jeanne d'Arc"
NFA_cult_of_jeanne_darc_desc:0 "In the place of Marianne, decadent icon of the corrupt republic, the AF has sought to celebrate and encourage the popularity of Jeanne d'Arc, medieval heroine of the Hundred Years' War, and a Catholic saint, seeing her as embodying the true French spirit of valour and piety."

NFA_business_alliance:0 "Business Alliance"
NFA_business_alliance_desc:0 "De la Rocque's party owes a lot to patriotic businessmen, whose support has been essential to the movement from its beginning. Now that the Croix-de-Feu is in power, these ties have been further consolidated, with many loyal businessmen brought into the government, as part of de la Rocque's corporatist policies."
NFA_class_cooperation:0 "Class Co-Operation"

NFA_dispos_desc:0 "The Dispos are the longstanding paramilitary and security service of the Croix-de-Feu, enforcing the party's presence and protecting its members without resorting to the same petty violence as groups like the Camelots du Roi. With de la Rocque in power, the Dispos have been given increased powers to protect state security."
NFA_french_corporatism:0 "French Corporatism"
NFA_french_corporatism_desc:0 "The Croix-de-Feu government has consolidated its corporatist economic policies, firmly entrenching a corporatist state in which social classes co-operate and are fairly represented under the oversight of the state, which intervenes when necessary to protect the interests of each social group, and to prevent class conflict."

NFA_legion_capitalism_idea:0 "Legion Capitalism"
NFA_legion_capitalism_idea_desc:0 "The industrial class, especially socially conscious right-wing businessmen, have long been influential in National France, bankrolling a range of nationalist movements. Now that Darnand is at the helm, he has further consolidated this, strengthening ties with businessmen who will accept his government, and seeking to more thoroughly use the market for the benefit of France."
NFA_legion_idealism_idea:0 "Legionary Idealism"
NFA_legion_idealism_idea_desc:0 "The many far-right movements that have coalesced into the Darnand government all share the same celebration of heroic idealism, and of a noble struggle to the end. Some say that ours is a lost cause, out here in the sands of a foreign land, but ours is the right cause, and it will triumph so long as a single one of us is left alive!"
NFA_underworld_connections_idea:0 "Underworld Connections"
NFA_underworld_connections_idea_desc:0 "Many of those who stayed in the Commune to form the resistance there were radical rightists similar to ourselves, who saw little hope in the Republican government in Algiers. Meanwhile, many more see us as a simple lesser evil compared to the Godless tyrants that are the Communards. Either way, Darnand will need the loyalty of the Métropole's anti-socialist underground more than ever in the coming years."

NFA_native_autonomy_idea_desc:0 "The Action Française has never been attached to jingoistic colonialism, viewing it as a waste of resources better spent on confronting France's real foes. With Maurras in power, the French government has granted traditional native elites, and, in the case of Algeria, native integralists, greater autonomy, in line with the AF's localist values. Although colonial rule remains intact, it is hoped that this will reduce expenditure and dampen native opposition."
NFA_colonial_status_quo:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_colonial_status_quo_desc:0 "The National French government has seen little reason to drastically reform colonial policies, in light of the immense benefits of cheap native labour and of prevailing acceptance of the civilising mission and colonial methods within white society.

NFA_french_friendship:0 "Friendship With France"
NFA_french_friendship_desc:0 "Our allies in France have tightened their bonds with us, striking new trade deals and military agreements."
NFA_diplomatic_prestige:0 "France on the World Stage"
NFA_diplomatic_prestige_desc:0 "Having experienced an economy, and tightened its bonds with its allies, France is once more a great power, respected by its friends and enemies alike and a force to be reckoned with."
NFA_army_of_liberation:0 "The Army of the Liberation"
NFA_army_of_liberation_desc:0 "The triumph of the Liberation of France, alongside our more recent military reforms, makes the French army one of the most prestigious and admired militaries of the world."
NFA_boom_years:0 "The Boom Years"
NFA_boom_years_desc:0 "With the war and reconstruction now truly behind us, the economy is very much back on its feet, and the sustained efforts of the government have created a new economic boom, as France becomes an immensely lucrative country for trade and business."
NFA_global_trade_deals:0 "Global Trade Deals"
NFA_global_trade_deals_desc:0 "The French government has begun striking trade deals across the world, in order to rejuvenate its economy and make new friends on the world stage."
NFA_urban_resurgence:0 "Urban Resurgence"
NFA_urban_resurgence_desc:0 "New efforts to rebuild urban industry and improve the quality of life in urban areas are paying off, as productivity increases and the market picks up."
NFA_german_garrison:0 "German Garrisons"
NFA_german_garrison_desc:0 "In exchange for the return of French territories seized after the war, we have had to allow Germany to maintain garrisons around France, in strategic locations. These are a symbol of the continued major concessions which we have to make to foreign powers, and could pose a major threat to us if hostilities develop with Germany."
NFA_german_concessions:0 "German Economic Concessions"
NFA_german_concessions_desc:0 "In exchange for the return of French territories seized after the war, we have had to allow Germany to  maintain various economic concessions across France, through ownership of French businesses, access to French resources, and favourable trade deals. Of course, this is deeply resented by the French people, who see it as evidence of foreign control."
NFA_property_committees:0 "Local Property Committees"
NFA_property_committees_desc:0 "In an effort to fairly settle the property disputes that have arisen between locals and returning exiles, the French government has established local committees with representation from both sides that can rule on property rights."
NFA_postwar_devastation_1:0 "Post-War Devastation"
NFA_postwar_devastation_1_desc:0 "The war to liberate France was long and brutal, and its aftermath sees the country in ruins, with food shortages, starvation, crime, and squalor having become facts of life for millions. A major effort will be required to resolve this."
NFA_postwar_devastation_3:0 "Slow Recovery"
NFA_postwar_devastation_3_desc:0 "Slowly but surely, the economy is beginning to stabilise, with work gradually returning and the worst of the food shortages put behind us. However, it will take far more continued effort to ensure that the horrendous poverty truly recedes."
NFA_postwar_devastation_4:0 "Economic Stabilisation"
NFA_postwar_devastation_4_desc:0 "Due to continued government efforts and constant relief programs, alongside greater investment from France's allies, the horrors of the devastation that immediately followed the liberation are at last a thing of the past, with the rebuilding of the nation having created a great many jobs and energised the economy."
NFA_administrative_chaos_1:0 "Administrative Chaos"
NFA_administrative_chaos_1_desc:0 "The move of the central government from Algiers to [NFA.Capital.GetName] has caused chaos in the administration, with the government having to rebuild the apparatus of state. Meanwhile, we are faced with a great deal of social disorder, which is increasingly being exploited by socialist remnants. Stabilising the political scene will be no easy task."
NFA_administrative_chaos_2:0 "Overstretched Administration"
NFA_administrative_chaos_2_desc:0 "Gradually, the administration has started to adapt to its new circumstances, with the worst inefficiency and political chaos put behind us. At the same time, however, much work remains to be done in order to ensure the political stability of the nation, and its acceptance by the people."
NFA_administrative_chaos_3:0 "Political Stabilisation"
NFA_administrative_chaos_3_desc:0 "Continued efforts, and the passing of time, have caused the bureaucracy to largely grow used to the administration of the métropole, and continued policing efforts have seen social disorder largely fade away, as our government is, if at times reluctantly, accepted by its people."

FRP_Arms_Treaty_idea:0 "German Supervision"
FRP_Arms_Treaty_idea_desc:0 "For the third time in 70 years, we have seen defeat in the face of German arms. Victorious over us, they have placed large restrictions over our industrialization and the size of the military that we can field."
GER_FRP_occupation_cost_idea:0 "Occupation of France"
GER_FRP_occupation_cost_idea_desc:0 "Without any agreement being reached with the Nationalists at Lyon, we must maintain our garrisons in the parts of France that we occupy. While it may not be popular at home for our troops to stay in France, they must not be allowed to rise up again!"

NFA_nationwide_martial_law:0 "Nationwide Martial Law"
NFA_nationwide_martial_law_desc:0 "Although the Martial Law declared in 1936 was never formally lifted, it came to be all too lightly enforced, particularly among white Frenchmen and the more trusted natives. With the situation still unstable and chaotic across the newly-liberated Metropolitan territories, we must restore our commitment to national security, and ensure that traitors are correctly dealt with."
NFA_veteran_favouritism:0 "Veteran Favouritism"
NFA_veteran_favouritism_desc:0 "There is no section of society more deserving of the nation's respect and gratitude than the heroes who risked their lives for France to be set free. The veterans of the Liberation campaign, especially career soldiers, are among Pétain's most loyal supporters, and extolling the heroism of common soldiers will inevitably legitimise our military government. An extended program of military benefits, and propaganda to portray veterans as the greatest heroes of France, will go a long way to strengthening our hand."
NFA_empowered_executive:0 "Empowered Executive"
NFA_empowered_executive_desc:0 "For too long, the lingering influence of civilian politicians and the parliamentary establishment has divided the nation and undermined its true leaders, the military. Only a President given free reign to defend the nation's interests, as Pétain should have been years ago, can truly serve the people. As such, we must eliminate the influence of liberal politicians and push through new legislation to give de Gaulle greater prerogatives to lead the French nation onwards."
NFA_centralised_economy:0 "Centralised Economy"
NFA_centralised_economy_desc:0 "A central executive is necessary not just to ensure stability and order, but also to defend the interests of the people, not least in financial affairs. A planned economy, regulated from [NFA.Capital.GetName] for the collective good, is necessary, with the market held in check and forced to serve the interests of the public, to ensure collaboration between classes."
NFA_ideal_of_joan_of_arc:0 "Cultural Ideals"
NFA_ideal_of_joan_of_arc_desc:0 "Saint Jeanne d'Arc, the peasant girl who nobly came to the defence of the nation in the Hundred Years' War, is the perfect ideal for the French people to aspire. Pious, patriotic, and valiant, every citizen should aspire to emulate her virtues. New education and cultural programmes will ensure that these principles are central to our culture."
NFA_naval_dominance:0 "Naval Dominance"
NFA_naval_dominance_desc:0 "It was the heroism of the Navy which made the Liberation possible, and they were the only section of the military that was never defeated in the Great War. It thus only follows that the Navy should be given special powers over the other sections of the Armed Forces, and that they should dominate the French government."
NFA_naval_propaganda:0 "National Bureau of Propaganda"
NFA_naval_propaganda_desc:0 "Admiral Darlan understands that it is essential to maintain the people's loyalty, by maintaining control over the information that they consume. It is crucial that the narratives within the media are consistent, coherent, and above all favourable towards the government and President. A more direct state involvement in propaganda, and greater intervention in the media, will ward off subversion for good."
NFA_market_relations:0 "Free Market Economy"
NFA_market_relations_desc:0 "One of the greatest evils of the Commune was its collectivisation of agriculture and industry, which required the theft of farms and factories from their rightful owners and almost invariably led to horrendous inefficiency. Whatever the short-term consequences, reversing these disastrous policies is vital for the future of France."
NFA_civilianisation:0 "Civilianisation"
NFA_civilianisation_desc:0 "With our recent moves having won back the loyalty of civilian politicians and the more liberal part of the population, we should put this new-found support to good use and restore civilian involvement in government, with capable politicians and industrialists taking over important government posts while the military remains in control, guiding the nation to ensure stability."
NFA_revolving_door:0 "The Revolving Door"
NFA_revolving_door_desc:0 "As we further cement our ties with civilian politics and industry, we should secure the existence of a "Revolving Door" between the military, business, and politics, with loyal and capable men going between these three areas of public life, to ensure uniform competence and loyalty between all three, and further cement our influence through society."
NFA_republican_caesar:0 "Republican Caesar"
NFA_republican_caesar_desc:0 "Just as Caesar's strong leadership and fearless charisma was the last hope of the Roman Republic, until his tragic assassination, Maréchal Pétain's leadership and charisma is the only thing that has allowed the values and ideals of the French Republic to live on, triumphing over stale reactionaries and socialist traitors alike. A new propaganda campaign will ensure that the people know this, and continue to be inspired by Pétain's heroism."
NFA_military_state:0 "Military State"
NFA_military_state_desc:0 "It was the military, and only the military, that freed this nation from the red tyrants. Their strategies, their commitment, their sacrifices, and crucially their leadership of the French nation through the Junta was what made the Liberation at all possible. Neither ourselves or the French people must ever forget that, and it is essential that the military continues to form the backbone of the government."
NFA_moral_order:0 "Moral Order"
NFA_moral_order_desc:0 "Central to the ideology of the National Revolution is a traditionalist ideal of French Catholoc culture, based around ruralism and a moral society. It is this ideal which Pétain's government must now implement in the freed métropole, with the Junta having committed itself to a restoration of traditional moral values. New education and cultural programmes will make this ideal a reality."
NFA_new_intervention:0 "New Economic Interventionism"
NFA_new_intervention_desc:0 "Although we are deeply grateful for the support that the Junta received from those in business before the liberation, we must not get ahead of ourselves in restoring unchecked capitalism or irresponsible business practices. The market must know its place, and be held to account in its social duty to provide for the common man, by a new programme of responsible state intervention."
NFA_agrarian_paternalism:0 "Agrarian Paternalism"
NFA_agrarian_paternalism_desc:0 "As we seek to promote a revived moral order, we must also promote a revival of the conditions from which that moral order arose: a stable and pious countryside, dedicated to hard work and faith, and confident in its trust in the government. A new state programme will do its best to encourage good Frenchmen to move to the countryside, and return to their ancestors' agrarian lifestyle."

NFA_maurrasian_doctrinal_cohesion:0 "Maurrassian Doctrinal Cohesion"
NFA_maurrasian_doctrinal_cohesion_desc:0 "The move from Paris to Algiers, combined with the shock of rapid decentralisation at the same time as a larger political shift, came close to undermining Maurras's government. However, the loyalty of the AF's allies in the military, particularly General de Hauteclocq, and the determined courage of our supporters, has ensured that the just and valiant leadership offered by the AF will continue, and restore France to the great nation that it was always meant to be."
NFA_decentralised_reconstruction:0 "Decentralised Reconstruction"
NFA_decentralised_reconstruction_desc:0 "With the shock of our initial measures towards decentralising governance having subsided, we can now further solidify local power by allowing loyal regional governments, formed by local Maurrassian supporters and with the full backing of the Crown, to manage the post-war recovery, both social and economic, on their own terms. This measure will ensure that our long standing principles are put into practice, and will guarantee that each region of France can rebuild itself in a manner that suits itself."
NFA_regional_autonomy:0 "Localist State"
NFA_regional_autonomy_desc:0 "What generations of decadent Republicans termed the "Ancien Regime" in truth held the key to reliable governance: each province of the Kingdom, within its own boundaries, could enjoy the protection and guidance of the Crown, while governing itself with a high degree of autonomy through its own Parliament, conscious of local needs while also devoted to the Crown and national interest. By restoring these Parliaments, we shall come far closer to restoring the old, true France."
NFA_heroic_idealism:0 "Heroic Idealism"
NFA_heroic_idealism_desc:0 "Only a government dedicated to action and idealism, under principled and dynamic leadership, can be a righteous government, and such a righteous government is what we can now build. For Deloncle and his inner circle to rebuild France and its society, they must assume absolute power throughout the nation, sweeping aside both the King's prerogatives, and Maurras's feeble attempts to create a balance powers through decentralisation. France will be one nation, strong and united under its Chief.."
NFA_revolutionary_nationalism:0 "Revolutionary Nationalism"
NFA_revolutionary_nationalism_desc:0 "Although the AF's traditionalist principles were admirable, Maurras never went far enough in his assessment of the causes of today's decadence, accepting rationalism and enlightenment philosophy. Only a true Revolution in France, a nationalist and popular Revolution against all the corrupting principles of Enlightenment thought and degenerate culture, can restore France to genuine traditionalism. All barriers to such a Revolution must be swept away by Deloncle's government."
NFA_cagoulard_intelligence:0 "Loyal Intelligence"
NFA_cagoulard_intelligence_desc:0 "Many of those within Deloncle's inner circle, and many of his allies outside of it, come from the intelligence services, an institution more than used to shadowy plots, and devoted to anti-socialism. Thus, it is crucial that we further entrench these alliances, giving Deloncle allies such as Loustanau-Lacau top jobs within the intelligence services and initiating as many operatives into La Cagoule as we can."
NFA_cagoulard_capitalism:0 "Cagoulard Capitalism"
NFA_cagoulard_capitalism_desc:0 "Those capitalists who can be brought over to our cause now have been, with many now initiated into the Order and those who proved more resistant dealt with as they deserve. As such, our loyal industrialists and innovators can now be given a free hand to lead the French economy into the future, with La Cagoule ready to protect them from seditious workers' movements and their talents put to the use of the nation."
NFA_new_centralisation:0 "New Centralisation"
NFA_new_centralisation_desc:0 "The King still, at least nominally, retains the sweeping powers which he gained under the Maurrassian government, even if Maurras only gave him such powers to legitimise his own actions. Nonetheless, it would be a grave mistake to strip the Crown of these prerogatives too hastily, when de Gaulle can use these special powers, exercised through the institution of the Crown, to strengthen the French state, and further centralise it around his own rule."
NFA_new_liberal_government:0 "Liberal Awakening"
NFA_new_liberal_government_desc:0 "De Jouvenel, despite being fundamentally a liberal, has always been attracted to "new" and radical elements of political thought, fuelling his interest in futurism, and he also makes no secret of the influence which both leftist and rightist radicals have had on his thought. De Jouvenel now promises a genuinely new politics to the French people, in which society can function in harmony, through a genuinely representative democracy and liberal economy, giving every citizen the space needed to innovate and rise to the top."
NFA_a_responsible_market:0 "Responsible Capitalism"
NFA_a_responsible_market_desc:0 "Whatever the beliefs of the most radical members of the emerging free-market school of thought in France, we must not get swept away in our programme of economic liberalisation, and cannot forget where an overly lax attitude to economics leads. The state must keep closely in touch with the direction of the economy, even if it rarely intervenes, and it is essential to make sure that ordinary people are still sufficiently provided for."
NFA_gaullist_dominance:0 "Gaullist Dominance"
NFA_gaullist_dominance_desc:0 "Few were surprised by the election results, which showed a clear victory for Charles de Gaulle and his National Royal Rally. De Gaulle now has genuine legitimacy for the first time since his coup, and has received a clear mandate from the people to steadily correct the errors of the Maurrassian government while stabilising the Kingdom and working towards economic prosperity for all."

Already poverty and misery are taking hold of our country and more and more people are turning to radical parties, often Communist, Totalist or Volkisch whose rhetoric has become largely anti-French. With poverty, rising radicalism, hatred towards the collaborating political elites and many other factors, the future of Germany, once a great power, seems unclear and uncertain..."

# Intro and starting politics

nfa.1.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - History"
nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic fell in the same way it came to be: in defeat by German arms and facing socialist unrest. As the civil war that followed the Communard revolution of 1920 eventually came to a close, the government chose exile instead of surrender. Having retreated to Marseilles, they embarked with the French navy towards Algiers, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the Boches. Neither happened and instead, a peace treaty was concluded between the German Empire and the Commune, with little to no regard towards the exiled government. The Commune was recognised as the successor of the French Republic by most of the newly German-aligned world, while the exiles remained seen as the legitimate government by those who had fought beside them in the Weltkrieg. But the refugees refused to be cowed: they renewed their claim as the legitimate government of all of France and her empire and their commitment to the Entente, preparing for any opportunity to strike.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the exile proved highly unstable. With the remnants of the Parliament and mainstream parties thrown into chaos by the defeat and exile, the great commander Ferdinand Foch seized control in a bloodless putsch, ruling at the head of a thinly-veiled junta until his death in 1929. His shoes were filled with ease by his fellow war hero, Phillipe Pétain, the Lion of Verdun. Pétain's rule has, so far, been perceived as less autocratic than his predecessor's, with the Maréchal willing to delegate to the Assembly and civilian politicians when needs be, and choosing to cooperate with the parties of the centre-right, as well as the corporatist Croix de Feu. Nevertheless, he alone is the leader of France, and the constitution remains suspended and ignored, with the military continuing to dominate both politics and the economy, and parliament often sidelined. However, Pétain’s premier, General Maurice Janin, has a less than admirable record of incompetence, and his many blunders may soon catch up with him and his government..."
nfa.1.a:0 "Those Accursed Communards!"

nfa.2.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - Political Situation"
nfa.2.d:0 "The circumstances of the revolution and exile have convinced Maréchal Pétain, and a large proportion of the population, that only a dynamic and authoritarian rule can save France, at least until the métropole is liberated. However, both far-right royalists and liberals are increasingly dissatisfied with the regime, and are slowly becoming restless for change. This is not helped by the percieved incompetence of the Premier, Maurice Janin, who has already endangered the government with his blunders before, and may well do so again. Even Pétain's allies in the Croix de Feu and FR are starting to grow impatient with the political stagnation, and de la Rocque's corporatists are increasingly hindered by internal factionalism, making them hardly the ally they once were.\n\nTo put it simply, the junta is slowly but surely losing political credibility and is now mainly held together by the prestige of Pétain. The Junta did, however, make several attempts to reassert its power, such as temporarily renaming the French Republic the 'French National State', the notion of 'State' affirming the temporary suspension of full democracy, and that of 'National' asserting itself as the only state truly representing the French people, as opposed to the universalist and internationalist character of the Communard government."
nfa.2.a:0 "We can trust the Lion!"

nfa.3.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - Growing Concerns"
nfa.3.d:0 "As if this lack of civilian support wasn’t enough, trust in the Marshal is starting to erode within the army, the backbone of the regime. Pétain’s favouritism towards his protégés has put many in key positions, and though they certainly are competent, many officers are left behind while others worry that this could encourage doctrinal rot, that Pétain is surrounding himself with yesmen. Increasingly, debate is flaring up within his clique, between General de Gaulle and  Admiral Darlan, whose proposals for the Libération are starkly different, over how the military should prepare to free the métropole.\n\nThe most important problem facing the nation, however, is simply its situation, in exile. Though in Algeria, officially annexed as part of France as an overseas department in the late 19th century, exiles and pieds-noirs settlers make up a significant part of the population, in some major cities even making up a majority, overall Europeans are still a small minority ruling over millions of indigènes, who despite being considered Frenchmen are essentially second-class citizens, subject to heavy taxes and forced labour, with rule from Algiers enforced by native elites and the army. Since the defeat in the Weltkrieg, the colonial situation is precarious: unrest is ruthlessly put down, recent famines were badly managed, syndicalist and pan-Arab agents spread propaganda against colonial authorities. However, most traditional indigenous elites are still loyal to France, and there exists a growing class of French-educated natives and native war veterans who despite wanting reform remain loyal. But one thing is clear: if the government is careless, further unrest and perhaps even revolts are bound to happen.\n\n§RBe careful! A failure to keep the resistance in non-core African states under 60 will result in revolts.§!"
nfa.3.a:0 "I’m sure it’s going to be fine!"

nfa.4.t:0 "Death of a Friend"
nfa.4.d:0 "His Majesty George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India, friend of France, our great ally during the Great War and since our exile, as well as a personal friend of Marshal Pétain since the two met on the battlefields two decades ago has died today at 70 years old. Though the situation is unfortunately tense at home, given the magnitude of the event it is important for the Entente that the Lion attends the funeral of George V and the coronation of his son Edward, and more personally for Pétain it is important to mourn a friend and ally, who like him oversaw the exile of his people after bloody revolutions in their homelands, and like him was wholeheartedly dedicated to one day come back and retake what is rightfully theirs. And so Marshal Pétain embarked on a special Trans-Atlantic flight, ready to honour the memory of a friend but celebrate a new era of Anglo-French friendship."
nfa.4.a:0 "The King is dead, long live the King!"

nfa.5.t:0 "The Lion in Canada"
nfa.5.d:0 "After a sixty-hour transatlantic flight, Marshal Pétain arrived in Ottawa, greeted by Prime Minister Mackenzie King and a large crowd of Canadians, mostly Québécois who see this state visit as a renewal of Anglo-French cooperation. They then drove to Windsor, where late King-Emperor George had asked to be buried. After a grandiose and emotional ceremony where Pétain was finally able to say farewell to a personal friend and ally, he took a tour of Ontario and Québec, greeted all along the way as a friend of the Empire, before meeting with King Edward VIII. In a pre-planned move, the two men shook hands in front of the media of the world, and the new king declared that no matter the struggles the future holds, the French and British nations would always fight side by side in this great crusade against the syndicalist threat. Later on, the two men held a private talk, discussing current issues facing the Entente, the policies that both men were planning on undertaking, as well as the inevitable prospect of war. The mutual undying commitment of both nations to each other was, of course, renewed, announcing even stronger bonds within the Entente."
nfa.5.a:0 "Time to return home"

committed_to_return_home:0 "Committed to return home"

natfra.6.t:0 "A Murder in the Casbah"
natfra.6.d:0 "Shocking news has reached the nation today. Last night, the retired General Henri Mordacq was found dead in the Casbah, having been stabbed repeatedly and left to bleed out in the gutter. Mordacq had a glittering career in the Great War, successfully holding the town of Arras against the Germans in 1914, and becoming deeply influential in the Clemenceau government. However, he became far too indebted to the Tiger for his own good, and with the fall of the Clemenceau government amidst the revolution and Foch's coup, his political career collapsed. His military career soon followed, with the general staff increasingly wary of his unorthodox theories. Nonetheless, by the time of his death he had become a prolific writer, and his fierce defence of Clemenceau had made him a prominent figure among liberals.\nAlready, the right-wing press, notably the Croix-de-Feu aligned paper ‘Le Flambeau’ and of course the Action Française, are pointing the finger at natives, Jews, socialists, and everything in between. Notably, this cause has been taken up by Joseph Darnand. This is the first major scandal to have broken out since he split from the Croix-de-Feu, and he clearly wants to make a success of it, calling in harsh and clear terms for a crackdown on Algerian nationalists.\nMany in the Pétain government, even if they lack the same hysteria, are also now calling for an investigation focused on Arab organisations in the Casbah and possible socialist infiltration, arguing simply and persuasively that these groups were likely behind the old general's death. However, some are arguing that we can't point the finger at any specific group yet, and a much broader investigation is needed. Janin's cabinet has so far been unable to reach a decision, and the premier himself seems dangerously indifferent. As such, the matter has reached Pétain himself, who must now come to a decision."
natfra.6.a:0 "The Arabs were obviously behind this, let's clean up the Casbah."
natfra.6.b:0 "We can't know for sure: maybe we should dig deeper..."

natfra.7.t:0 "The Culprits"
natfra.7.d:0 "After weeks of investigation, loyally aided by numerous white citizens who were present in the Casbah at the time, it has been made clear beyond much doubt that Algerian nationalists were at fault for Mordacq's murder. Although a specific murderer has not yet been found, and those we have rounded up have proved notably resilient under interrogation, it is quite clear to all involved that cells of the socialist and Algerian nationalist ENA, and its associated groups, were responsible.\nAs such, the government has resolved to order a new crackdown on nationalism and native groups across Algeria and the West African colonies, lest this happen again. Meanwhile Joseph Darnand, whose own nephew aided the police during the investigation, has emerged from his first major political test stronger than ever."
natfra.7.a:0 "I want all these Arabs behind bars before sunset!"

natfra.8.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrest"
natfra.8.d:0 "Today, the news splashed across the front pages has astonished most. The murderers of Henri Mordacq have been clearly proven as guilty and rounded up. They are, however, a far cry from the Arabs, Jews, or leftists whom Maurras and Darnand had accused. Rather, the guilty men are outwardly respectable white citizens - and among them, crucially, is Henry Charbonneau, Joseph Darnand's own nephew and a former member of the Action Française, who drifted further to the right and joined more fringe leagues. This connection to the murder has greatly embarassed Darnand, and aroused a great deal of suspicion. Clearly, the circumstances and motives behind Mordacq's death will have to be looked into even further."
natfra.8.a:0 "This doesn't seem right..."

natfra.9.t:0 "La Cagoule"
natfra.9.d:0 "After much investigation and infiltration by the police, the full shocking truth of Mordacq's death has now become clear.\nThe naval veteran and engineer Eugène Deloncle, who had initially supported the AF before leaving it due to his frustration with Maurras's unwillingness to violently seize power, has formed a deep-running and extemsive terrorist organisation, up to now in total secrecy. Deloncle's organisation, dubbed "La Cagoule" by the AF writer Maurice Pujo, due to the cowls they wear in their initiation rituals, seemingly sought to inspire harsher crackdowns against liberals and Arab nationalists, as well as further radicalise the French right, by framing leftist or Arab groups for terror attacks, as happened in the case of Mordacq.\nThe group, it is clear, has enjoyed the support of several notable industrialists, most notably the founder of L'Oréal, Eugène Schueller, and countless previously respected figures have been implicated in the scandal. Most prominently among these is Joseph Darnand himself, now revealed to be an active member of the organisation, and directly complicit in the death of the general. Although an attempt was made to bring him to justice, his home was found abandoned, and it is believed that he has fled across the sea to Romania."
natfra.9.a:0 "Terrorist scum!"

natfra.10.t:0 "Janin's Plan"
natfra.10.d:0 "Pétain's premier, Maurice Janin, has few redeeming features. He is uncharismatic, unmotivated, incompetent, and prone to political blunders. He is, however, loyal, and it is that loyalty that has inspired him to come to the Maréchal today with an undesirable, if necessary, proposal.\nIn order to ensure that he has the political capital to push through the military spending that is needed to get the army into a fit state for the Liberation, Janin intends to pay off a large number of deputies in the Assembly.\nAlthough he knows that such corrupt measures are far from ideal, and could cause significant problems if leaked, Janin is certain that it is the only way forward, in light of growing frustration with his government and abilities. Reluctantly, Pétain can only agree."
natfra.10.a:0 "Let's at least hope this can be kept quiet..."

natfra.11.t:0 "The Scandal Breaks"
natfra.11.d:0 "In news that surprised few in the know, Janin's corruption has today been exposed, in all its sordid detail. Elaborate bribes, disturbing threats, even promises to turn a blind eye to blatantly illegal activity in exchange for support: all have been common practices of the Janin government, and all have intensified recently as Janin makes a belated effort to strengthen his hand. Everyone from the staunch liberal Camille Chautemps to Charles Maurras and Joseph Darnand have harshly rebuked not only Janin but Pétain himself, and although Janin's own fall from power is now a certainty, some even speculate that the Junta itself is on the way out."
natfra.11.a:0 "Ah, merde..."

natfra.12.t:0 "Janin's Resignation"
natfra.12.d:0 "Today, the inevitable came to pass, and, after two days spent locked away in his office, Maurice Janin gave a short, regretful speech to a jeering assembly, announcing his immediate resignation. It is clear that Pétain himself had forced him out, threatening that if he didn't go quietly he would lose not only his rank in the army but his liberty as well. And thus fell the Janin regime, ineffectual and shambolic to the end. Pétain's next move as he attempts to stabilise the situation is for now unknown, but members of the Croix-de-Feu, FR, and even AF have all been seen meeting with representatives of the junta."
natfra.12.a:0 "What lies next?"

natfra.13.t:0 "Our Next Move"
natfra.13.d:0 "Ever since Janin resigned, the Republic has been without any Prime Minister, and the junta has been in chaos, with Pétain forced to take on the daily administrative responsibilities that he has grown used to delegating. Meanwhile, protests supported by everyone from liberals to legionnaires are continuing in the streets, and we are running out of time to stabilise the situation. As such, two possibilities lie before Pétain.\nFirst, as is suggested by many, he could seek to gain the support of civilian politicians, through more... legitimate means than Janin had used. This would entail entering into discussions with either François de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu and darling of the far right, or Louis Marin, leader of the centre-right Fédération Républicain. Either man would be able to use his political prestige and support base to restore confidence in the regime, but would also demand extensive concessions in exchange for doing so: something which has inspired some Pétain loyalists to urge the Maréchal not to bother talking to any politicians. Civilian politics, they argue, is responsible for dragging France into the chaos it currently faces, and it is time for Pétain to fully secure the junta's position and bend the Assembly to his will.\nThe old marshal must choose a course of action, but he has little time..."
natfra.13.a:0 "Arrange a meeting with de la Rocque, we need nationalist backing."
natfra.13.b:0 "We have to maintain the basis of the Republic: reach out to Marin."
natfra.13.c:0 "Enough is enough. Declare martial law in Algiers!"

natfra.14.t:0 "A Meeting with the Colonel"
natfra.14.d:0 "As faithfully arranged by Pétain's supporters, the Lion of Verdun, the respected commander of the Great War, has met with François de la Rocque, a heroic common soldier from the same conflict. While Pétain rose first to the position of Foch's right-hand man, de la Rocque became active in veterans' groups, joining the right-wing Croix-de-Feu in 1927 and taking it over two years later, the same year that Pétain succeeded the late Foch as President. Since them, de la Rocque has greatly expanded his organisation from a vaguely nationalistic group for disgruntled old soldiers to a formidabble political movement, advocating for corporatist economics, French nationalism, and a strong Presidency. Perhaps predictably, the Croix-de-Feu has so far been glad to support the Junta, gaining the votes of many of Pétain's sympathisers among the public and has been vital in maintaining parliamentary support for the junta.\nAlthough de la Rocque now promises that he will continue to stand by Pétain no matter what, he today suggested to the Marshal that appointing a new cabinet, dominated by members of the Croix-de-Feu, with himself as Premier, would go a long way to resolving the crisis. He is, indeed, correct. With open backing from de la Rocque's newspaper, Le Flambeau, his paramilitary "dispos", and from his extensive support base, the junta will surely be able to move on from the crisis. Nonetheless, some allies are cautioning Pétain that granting de la Rocque such influence may well lead to the end of the junta, with de la Rocque slowly displacing the Maréchal."
natfra.14.a:0 "We must be sure of his backing, we have to accept."
natfra.14.b:0 "He'll stay loyal anyway: we don't need to give him so much power."

natfra.15.t:0 "The de la Rocque Cabinet"
natfra.15.d:0 "Today, Pétain appeared before the assembly to give an extensive speech, broadcast to the nation over radio, admitting the failings of the junta and acknowledging the need for reform. With that in mind, he went on to announce that the popular right-wing nationalist, Colonel François de la Rocque, would be appointed as his new premier, with a cabinet dominated by the Colonel's allies in his party and in business. This is a significant change in direction for the junta, as de la Rocque, despite his military past, left the army shortly after the war, and is thus the first civilian Premier since Foch's coup. Such a major step has astonished many around the world, and, although the nature of de la Rocque's policies hardly makes this a sign of liberalisation, the sun may be setting on the Junta."
natfra.15.a:0 "Good luck, Premier de la Rocque!"

natfra.16.t:0 "Martial Law"
natfra.16.d:0 "With the crisis dragging on, and his opportunities to form political alliances either exhausted or refused, Maréchal Pétain today took the drastic step of declaring martial law in Algiers, citing "the ongoing struggle against syndicalism" as his formal reason. Of course, this has confused few, and it is obvious that he intends simply to consolidate his own power. Later in the day, a large number of soldiers, led by General de Gaulle entered the Assembly. Reluctantly unchallenged by the liberals and greeted with cheers by the delegates of the Croix-de-Feu, they presented a simple bill, declaring full support for Phillipe Pétain and recognising him as both President and Prime Minister. The motion was adopted near-unanimously, and the handful that voted against it were promptly placed under arrest.\nNow, young soldiers patrol the streets of Algiers, rounding up Arab nationalists in the Casbah and liberal dissidents in the European quarter. Opposition to Pétain will doubtless fast evaporate, as politicians scramble to save their careers and freedom. Although it has taken brute force to secure the junta, and some condemnation may come our way, this alone could have saved France."
natfra.16.a:0 "Vive le Maréchal!"

natfra.17.t:0 "A Meeting with Marin"
natfra.17.d:0 "As faithfully arranged by Pétain's supporters, the Lion of Verdun, the respected commander of the Great War, has met with Louis Marin, a conservative politician and staunch republican. When Foch assumed control of the government, Marin was one of many centrist politicians who reluctantly accepted the junta as a stabilising force. Over the 1920s, he came to staunchly defend the Foch regime from both its opponents and his own party, and with the tacit backing of the Junta, took charge of the Fédération Républicain, a Catholic conservative party nonetheless committed to the Republic. When Pétain succeeded Foch in 1929, Marin aided in the smooth transition of power, and has since been a prominent, if reluctant, supporter of the regime in the assembly. Pétain for his part has been willing to delegate policymaking and day-to-day administration to the FR, among other parliamentary allies.\nHowever, Marin is now suggesting that only reforms can restore the people's confidence in Pétain's government. As such, he is urging the Maréchal to appoint him as the new Premier, with a cabinet made up of liberals and republicans, to slowly prepare the French nation for a return to democratic life, once the Métropole is liberated. However, many in Pétain's clique argue that we cannot risk allowing liberals too much influence, and that parliamentary chaos must be avoided."
natfra.17.a:0 "Reform is the way forward, accept his proposals."
natfra.17.b:0 "Politicians' bickering got us into this mess in the first place!"

natfra.18.t:0 "The Marin Cabinet"
natfra.18.d:0 "Today, Pétain appeared before the assembly to give an extensive speech, broadcast to the nation over radio, admitting the failings of the junta and acknowledging the need for reform. With that in mind, he went on to announce that the veteran conservative and republican, Louis Marin, would be appointed as his new premier, with a cabinet dominated by republican politicians and liberal-minded businessmen. This is a significant change in direction for the junta, Marin, a longstanding deputy and leader of the Fédération Républicain, is the first civilian Premier since Foch's coup. Such a major step has astonished many around the world, and, although Marin would certainly have had to accept the continuation of the Pétain presidency to get this far, this may well be a sign of steps towards democratisation."
natfra.18.a:0 "Good luck, Premier Marin!"

natfra.19.t:0 "Time's Running Out" 
natfra.19.d:0 "Having turned down his allies' overtures, and with the protests ongoing, Pétain is in an increasingly difficult position. Although both de la Rocque and Marin have promised that they will continue to stand by the junta, our refusal to make meaningful concessions to either man has certainly ensured that their support will be hardly vigorous in the coming weeks. And, with the protesters going nowhere, this won't be enough.\nWith this in mind, multiple allies of Pétain, including both General de Gaulle and Admiral Darlan, are now once again urging the Maréchal to declare martial law, arguing that civilian politics has lead to this chaos, and that it is time for us to move on from it for good, if the junta is to live on and the métropole is to be retaken. However, others are urging us to make discreet overtures to various far-right leagues, to see if their support will bolster our image."
natfra.19.a:0 "Enough is enough: martial law it is."
natfra.19.b:0 "We can do this legitimately if we gain the leagues' support."

natfra.20.t:0 "Maurras's Gambit"
natfra.20.d:0 "Having been quietly contacted by associates of the President looking for backing, Charles Maurras, the political philosopher and dominant politician of the Orléanist monarchist and integral-nationalist Action Française, has seemingly formed a clear impression that the junta has become desperate for support. It is with this in mind, it appears, that he and his allies in the AF today announced a new motion in the assembly, to formally lift the law of exile against royal pretenders, allowing them back into France. Although this is not an outright effort at restoring the monarchy, it is the crucial first step to doing so, and thus an extremely ambitious move on the part of Maurras.\nEspecially telling was Maurras's humble request, repeated in later speeches by Maurice Pujo and Henri Massis, for the support of President Pétain in his efforts. Of course, such an endorsement of Maurras's move would allow the act to pass with ease, and lead on to a restoration of the monarchy. But, it would seem, Maurras won't take anything less in exchange for his support."
natfra.20.a:0 "We need allies, give him our backing."
natfra.20.b:0 "This is too far: we can't allow the republic itself to be destroyed!"

natfra.21.t:0 "The Unlikely Alliance"
natfra.21.d:0 "With the law of exile having been repealed with Pétain's backing, Jean d'Orléans, the Duc de Guise and Orléanist claimant to the throne, has arrived amidst royalist celebrations in Algiers. He was also greeted by General de Gaulle, a clear sign of the junta's growing willingness to back monarchism, as well as a reminder of de Gaulle's own royalist instincts. Many now predict a restoration of the Orléans monarchy within the near future, claims that the junta has been hesitant to deny.\nMeanwhile, the newspaper and supporters of the Action Française have taken a firmly pro-junta stance recently, rallying around Pétain as the presumed saviour of their hopes of a restoration, and encouraged in this by Maurras and Pujo. Confronted in the streets by the AF's paramilitary Camelots du Roi, the protests have also begun to fade away. A new mood of optimism has set in around the Presidential palace, and Pétain is glad that the tide has finally turned in his favour." 
natfra.21.a:0 "All as planned!"

natfra.22.t:0 "A Spanner in the Works"
natfra.22.d:0 "Until today, all has been going well and smoothly in our collaboration with Maurras and the AF. Most have come to believe that the junta will live on, even if the monarchy will return. However, things became notably more complicated today.\nWith the repeal of the law of exile having allowed every royal claimant to return, Louis Bonaparte, claimant to the throne of the French Empire, arrived in Tunis today. This has considerably disrupted our plans for a smooth consolidation of power, with the roots of a resurgent Bonapartism now beginning to grow: having to choose between two royal houses is less than desirable. Many of Pétain's allies, including de Gaulle, simply argue that we should ignore Bonaparte. The Empire fell in 1870, and there is no organised political movement equivalent to the Action Française that can fight for its restoration.\nHowever, others, including François Darlan, are arguing that this is a good opportunity not to let Maurras's influence grow too out of hand, and that we should tacitly support the more-easily controlled Bonaparte."
natfra.22.a:0 "We owe Maurras our loyalty: ignore him."
natfra.22.b:0 "We should be wary of the AF's power, endorse Bonaparte."

natfra.23.t:0 "Pétain's Speech"
natfra.23.d:0 "Today in Algiers, President Pétain, flanked by military loyalists and Action Française politicians alike, gave an extensive and charismatic speech, detailing the failures of the Republic. Blaming the inherent weakness and infighting of parliamentary rule for the defeat in both the Great War and revolution, and in the short term for the corruption that brought down Marin, Pétain declared that only a return to monarchical rule, under the House of Orléans, could save France, and that preparations would be made for a restoration. The old marshal also proceeded to announce a new cabinet, dominated by prominent members of the AF.\nWith monarchists celebrating in the streets, and both Maurras and the Duc de Guise having declared their happiness at this turn of events, it is clear that the future if France is a future under its King."
natfra.23.a:0 "Vive le Roi de demain!"

natfra.24.t:0 "Maurras's Anger"
natfra.24.d:0 "With Pétain having publicly given his tacit support to the young Louis Bonaparte's claim to the throne, the Orléanist Action Française, which has so far been invaluable to our efforts to preserve the junta, has been thrown into a fury. Senior members of the AF have stormed out of meetings with Pétain loyalists, and Charles Maurras' own less than flattering remarks about the President have been eagerly picked up by sensationalists in the press.\nWith this new crisis threatening to undermine our continued control in power, many within Pétain's clique, notably General de Gaulle, are strongly urging the Maréchal to make a necessary U-turn and cut off his support for the Bonapartists, and thus seek to again placate the AF. However, many others insist that by distancing ourselves from the AF, we made the right choice, stopping our influence from growing unchecked. Turning around now, they argue, would be humiliating, and we should instead dig in our support of the Bonapartist claim, and weather the storm."
natfra.24.a:0 "We've come this far in support of Bonapartism; we can't backtrack now."
natfra.24.b:0 "We have to eat our words and try to find a settlement with Maurras."

natfra.25.t:0 "The Third Empire"
natfra.25.d:0 "With Pétain having doggedly supported young Louis Bonaparte for several weeks now, in the face of anger from liberals and the far right alike, few were surprised today, when President Pétain declared the Third Republic to be at an end. In a simple and brief act, obediently passed by Pétain's allies in the assembly in spite of the Orléanist AF delegates storming out, the French Empire, the great nation which once had stretched from Haiti to Moscow, was reborn. Louis Napoléon, having met repeatedly with Pétain over the past weeks, was declared Emperor and a formal coronation is said to be under preparation.\nAlthough many came to predict such a move, the restoration of a largely discredited monarchy, which has never had a political movement to continue its legacy like the Orléanists, has come as a profound shock to almost everyone. Nevertheless, most citizens have taken a positive attitude to the restoration, and have come to hope that the young Louis, with the loyal aid of the Lion of Verdun, can restore the greatness of his ancestor."
natfra.25.a:0 "Vive l'Empereur, et Vive la France!"

natfra.26.t:0 "An Offer from Darnand"
natfra.26.d:0 "With political instability ongoing, and the rift between the junta and far right only increasing, something must be done. And it seems, at last, that we have a solution. The minor but nonetheless increasingly popular far right leader, Joseph Darnand, who claims inspiration from the Romanian legionaries, has approached Pétain, Maurras, and de la Rocque with a proposal for a "meeting of national pacification" chaired by himself. Describing his goal as the unity of the French right behind Pétain, to strengthen and bring together the nation in preparation for the liberation, Darnand believes that his relatively fringe position to the other men will let him position himself as a compromise candidate and a mediator between them, in spite of his being significantly more radical than the others.\nEven if Darnand himself can find little goodwill among Pétain's clique, most of the Maréchal's advisors are urging that we take the opportunity to attempt to further unite the nation. Time, they insist, is running out to resolve the crisis, and we must take this opportunity to find allies."
natfra.26.a:0 "We need a united nation, arrange the meeting."
natfra.26.b:0 "How can a seditious radical restore unity where we have failed?"

natfra.27.t:0 "The Meeting of National Pacification"
natfra.27.d:0 "Charles Maurras and François de la Rocque, the two great rivals of the French right, faced each other uneasily from opposite sides of the table. Staring distractedly out of the window of the Presidential Palace, de la Rocque looked down on the sprawl of Algiers below. Maurras, meanwhile, gazed at the large Presidential Standard on the wall opposite, admiring the detail of Pétain's axe symbol. The impending arrival of President Pétain himself, not to mention that of the upstart Darnand, hardly reduced the tension. In spite of their many differences, neither man could understand what Pétain saw in this deluded legionnaire, or how Darnand could possibly think he could stabilise the nation. But they had both needed to appear committed to national unity, and so they had both obediently arrived at the palace an hour before.\nThe patter of footsteps began to resonate from the corridor outside, and Maurras and de la Rocque alike braced themselves for long hours of argument, both knowing it would be in vain. They heard the doors open, and what seemed to be the President commenting to an aide.\n\nAnd then, the bomb went off, and all the tension, all the rivalry, was swept away in fire and chaos."
natfra.27.a:0 "Quelle catastrophe!"

natfra.28.t:0 "The Saviour of France"
natfra.28.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Presidential Palace bombing, the entire nation and administration fell into chaos. With Charles Maurras and François de la Rocque both dead, their parties rapidly fell into chaos, amidst infighting and, more importantly, total shock and astonishment at what had happened. President Pétain, for his part, was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, leaving him unable to maintain order while his allies squabbled among themselves. \nIt was only Joseph Darnand who could offer the vision, determination, and strength needed to save France in its hour of need. With the bomb having gone off mere minutes before he arrived at the palace, he was at the centre of events from the start. His natural charisma soon allowed him to take charge of the efforts to maintain order, ensuring that the President could safely get to hospital. Shortly afterwards, understanding the gravity of the situation and how thoroughly France had been betrayed by its politicians, he ordered his loyal militiamen to storm the assembly. With the whole administration thrown into chaos, the brave men faced no resistance, and it was not long before Darnand addressed the nation over the radio.\nA nefarious plot, he declared, has unfolded. The communards, bankrolled and aided by the Jews and Freemasons not only of Algiers but of the entire world, and using Algerian nationalists as useful idiots, had conspired to kill Pétain. And just how close their plot had come to success, Darnand stated, only showed how complicit the political class was in this disgraceful plot against France itself. The liberals in the assembly, the Jews, the Masonic lodge of Algiers, the natives: every vile force opposed to the French Race had come together this day, and it was through his leadership and the glory of France alone that they had failed. Only a radical, indeed revolutionary, reorganisation of the French State, he announced, could save France from its foes. Shortly afterwards, having regained consciousness in hospital, a shaken Marshal Pétain confirmed Darnand as Premier."

As such, the Maréchal has appointed General Charles de Gaulle, a loyal member of Pétain's clique, as the new Premier of France. With his influence having been much strengthened by the adoption of his proposals for the liberation of the métropole, de Gaulle's appointment has come as a surprise to few, and many in the country have high hopes for his administration."

natfra.31.t:0 "Finding Parliamentary Backers"
natfra.31.d:0 "As we seek to ensure lasting loyalty within the Assembly, and eventually make the body fully subordinate to the military government, we must deepen our ties with right-wing parties who can assist us. So far, the parties most friendly towards the junta have been Louis Marin's Fédération Républicaine, and François de la Rocque's Croix-de-Feu.\nThe FR, in spite of its Catholic and conservative policies, is deeply committed to Republicanism and democratic ideals, with the result that the more authoritarian members of Pétain's clique distrust it as overly liberal. Nonetheless, Marin has always supported the Junta, arguing that it is impossible to seek full democracy in the current circumstances, so doubling down on his support may well lend us legitimacy.\nOn the other hand, de la Rocque's party is far less committed to Parliamentarism and the Republic, but de la Rocque has long sought to cultivate a cult of personality which some fear could challenge Pétain's own, alongside his party's mass membership, a new innovation in French politics which troubles some traditionalists.\Nevertheless, we need allies, and due to the rivalry between the two parties we must settle on one of the two as our primary ally."

De la Rocque also sought to round up support for the recent law, but with Pétain having chosen to cooperate with his rival Marin instead, he has lost a significant amount of influence."

De la Rocque now argues that government funds to further expand his party would further strengthen the Junta's hand, and garner more legitimacy."

However, others argue that the constitution is an opportunity for a more fundamental step away from civilian politics, and that we should formally give broad governmental powers to the institution of the Army itself."

Many of Pétain's more conservative allies want the camps to focus on teaching the youth traditional values and strong morality, while other members of the junta would prefer for young men to mainly be taught support for the junta, and devotion to the Maréchal, in order to ensure the loyalty of the next generation. Many in the army, however, instead want the camps to mainly provide basic training and physical fitness programs, to prepare young men for military service."

However, allegations are starting to surface in the less loyal elements of the press, and in simple rumours, of a blatant corruption that goes far beyond simply favouring the more supportive businessmen for contracts. Many within the government are urging Pétain to act quickly and crack down on any such behaviour, lest we see a repeat of the Janin scandal. However, others point out that times have changed since then, and that we are now in a better position to simply crush the rumours before they become embarrassing."

Many men who had previously given large funds to liberal parties, and in some cases had even publicly citicised the government, are now working on vital projects for the state. This could be deeply embarrassing for us if it gets out, and could leave the junta vulnerable: after all, who knows what contacts they still maintain with enemies of the government?

Notably, these books emphasise the competence and successes of France's officer corps, not least Pétain himself, and the bravery of common soldiers. Such a celebration of the French military thus leaves the blame for defeat with the civilian politicians of the war, who are accused of having doomed France through their infighting and weakness, an accusation that chimes well with Pétain's own rhetoric about the divisive and weak nature of parliamentary democracy. In all, this new historical trend is a triumph for the junta's image and prestige."

Many believe that it would be simplest to just repeal the legislation which has up to now repressed the Catholic Church.

natfra.47.d:0 "With Roman Catholicism having been enshrined some months ago as the state religion of France, President Pétain today made a state visit to Rome. After meeting with [ITA.GetLeader], and ensuring promises of further economic co-operation and friendship, Pétain made his way to the Vatican, where he met with the Pope. The two men, official reports state, discussed personal matters of faith, before Pétain assured His Holiness that National France would always be ready to protect the Holy See, and his government would do all it could to protect the Church and its followers, not only in France but arounf the world."
natfra.47.a:0 "With the support of His Holiness, nobody can stop us!"

natfra.48.t:0 "The Ideology of the Révolution Nationale"
natfra.48.d:0 "With Pétain having now announced a "national revolution" to sweep away all that has so far held France and its people back, and stating that this will be the ideological basis of his regime, we must now clarify what this ideology in fact promotes. Pétain's old friends within the army largely want us to centre it around militarism and French nationalism, while the Catholic conservatives whom Pétain has more recently aligned with would prefer a program of traditionalism and morality. Others, meanwhile, believe we should simply centre our "ideology" around Pétain himself, and use it as an extension of his cult of personality."
natfra.48.a:0 "Militarism and nationalism will restore glory to France!"
natfra.48.b:0 "Only a moral people under God stands a chance of liberating the patrie!"
natfra.48.c:0 "Pétain alone knows what is best for the nation!"

natfra.49.t:0 "Support from the Archbishop of Algiers"
natfra.49.d:0 "Today, in front of his large congregation, Auguste-Fernand Leynaud, Archbishop of Algiers, called on all French Catholics to strive for the liberation of their homeland and of their Catholic brothers and sisters, currently suffering under Communard tyranny. Although many Catholics were disappointed by Pétain's reluctance to fully restore Catholicism as the state religion, Leynaud's excellent sermon has gone a long way to helping Pétain build a support base among conservative Catholics."
natfra.49.a:0 "Excellent!"

natfra.50.t:0 "Darnand Breaks with the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.50.d:0 "François de la Rocque's Catholic corporatist Croix-de-Feu, a major ally of the junta in the Assembly, today suffered a significant setback. The party has long been a broad-tent coalition, united mainly by de la Rocque's own charisma and by a shared distrust for liberal democracy. However, the tensions caused by this have clearly reached a boiling point, with some of the party's hardliners under Joseph Darnand, splitting off entirely to form a new "Chevaliers du Glaive" party.\nClaiming inspiration from the legionaries in Romania, and seeking to defend French racial purity and restore French power in Europe, Darnand has notably proclaimed his absolute loyalty to the Pétain government, in what we can only assume is a ploy for influence in the junta. Nevertheless, Darnand's group remains on the extreme fringe, and his radicalism is regarded with suspicion by much of the population, while Pétain's allies in the junta have no interest in working with him. If anything, his split from the Croix-de-Feu has harmed de la Rocque through exposing the divisions in his own party, more than it has helped Darnand."
natfra.50.a:0 "We can safely ignore this lunatic."

natfra.51.t:0 "The End of the Republic"
natfra.51.d:0 "Over the past weeks, the junta has been greatly stabilised, buoyed by the backing of the Action Française both in its newspaper and on the streets. This has come, however, at a dear price, and it seems that the royalists have finally gotten their way.\nAs such, Philippe Pétain today announced, flanked by prominent members of the AF, that the Third Republic, having been proven by the defeat in the Great War, the revolution, and now the fall of Janin to be unworkable, was no more. In its place, to seek true unity and revive the genuine spirit of France, the Orléans monarchy would be restored under Jean, Duc de Guise.\nAlthough most commentators saw this coming when the junta and AF began collaborating, it has nevertheless came as a great shock to the nation, and most Frenchmen barely know what to make of such a seismic political shift. Nevertheless, the dominant mood appears to be relief that the crisis is over, and a hope that the monarchy will lead to the political stabilisation and deeper unity needed to free the métropole."
natfra.51.a:0 "A new dawn for the nation."

natfra.52.t:0 "The Coronation"
natfra.52.d:0 "Today in Algiers, all the dreams of the Action Française and of French royalism were at last realised. In a long and elaborate ceremony, Jean d'Orléans was crowned King of France, with as many ancient rites and rituals as the circumstances of exile made possible. Notably, however, the new King did not swear, as his ancestors did, to fight infidels, owing to the AF's alliance with Arab groups, and the need to maintain the loyalty of the largely Muslim native population.\nAfter the coronation was finished, Jean met in private with both Philippe Pétain and Charles Maurras, apparently discussing the future governance of France with the monarchy back in place."
natfra.52.a:0 "Vive le Roi!"

natfra.53.t:0 "The King's Cabinet"
natfra.53.d:0 "Today, after some days of political wrangling presided over by the King, a new government for the resurrected Kingdom was at last agreed. Philippe Pétain's previous role as Head of State has been made redundant by the monarchy, and he has instead accepted to become Minister of War, while Charles Maurras becomes Premier in his place, and prominent cabinet roles are filled by loyal AF men.\nIn practice, the message is clear: the military junta, which has dominated French politics since 1919, is no more. Although many saw this coming as Pétain became more and more dependent on Maurras to prop up his rule, such a sudden departure from power has nonetheless astonished many. However, by 1936 most Frenchmen had become disgruntled with military rule, not incorrectly seeing the junta as more and more corrupt and stagnant. Although Maurras is far from universally liked either, he has a strong and growing support base, and most of the country only hopes that he can do a better job than his predecessors."
natfra.53.a:0 "Maurras will lead the nation on to greatness!"

natfra.54.t:0 "The Purpose of the Camelots du Roi"
natfra.54.d:0 "Now that we have resolved to deepen the role of the Camelots du Roi within the government, we must settle on a clearer purpose for the movement. So far, under Maurice Pujo, the Camelots have formally been considered a youth group, but in practice have more closely resembled a political paramilitary, with young men in the organisation often engaging in street fights with members of opposing parties and protecting AF politicians. Many now believe that such an organisation is vital for the government to hold on to power, but others believe that reforming it into a genuine youth group would also be a successful policy."
natfra.54.a:0 "We need the loyalty of the next generation: reform it into a youth movement."
natfra.54.b:0 "The opposition is still a threat, keep it as it is."

natfra.55.t:0 "Controlling the Streets"
natfra.55.d:0 "Since we formalised the Camelots du Roi's position as a political paramilitary, the organisation has been indispensable in maintaining order around the country. In every major city, loyal Camelots can frequently be seen keeping watch on the streets, and have been vital in rounding up undesirables and dissidents, and impressing the strength of the new government on ordinary people. This assertion of government power has done much to stabilise our regime, greatly encouraging Pujo and the rest of the AF leadership."
natfra.55.a:0 "We salute their courage."

natfra.56.t:0 "Royalist Youth Camps"
natfra.56.d:0 "Over the past weeks, the Camelots du Roi have been reformed into a genuine youth movement, with their more paramilitary members re-assigned to the growing secret police, and boys around the country enrolled. Now, youth camps are opening around the country, funded and supported by the state. These institutions will teach the youth of the nation true moral values, alongside dedication to the King and respect for the hierarchies of society."
natfra.56.a:0 "An excellent initiative!"

natfra.57.t:0 "The Republican Intellectuals"
natfra.57.d:0 "As we consolidate power and restore the Orléans monarchy to its rightful place, we must deal with the philosophers, writers, political theorists, and other dubious "intellectuals" who were prominent supporters of the Republic. Although it goes without saying that their writings and theories must be suppressed, many in the government would also like to see these seditious figures locked up, while others argue that they can do no harm by themselves, and leaving them be would avoid controversy."
natfra.57.a:0 "I want these pseudo-intellectuals behind bars!"
natfra.57.b:0 "They're not a threat if we stamp out their literature."

natfra.58.t:0 "The Fate of the Politicians"
natfra.58.d:0 "The Third Republic was home to an extensive and burgeoning ruling class, and now, as we work to dismantle it, we must decide on its fate. Hardliners with the government rightly blame these men for the weakness and failings of the Republic, and for promoting horrific decadence, but some moderates believe that, with their political parties dissolved and influence no more, they can be no threat to us, and that taking more action against them would only lead to condemnation."
natfra.58.a:0 "They're all corrupt scum, we can't take any chances."
natfra.58.b:0 "They aren't able to challenge us any more, leave them alone."

natfra.59.t:0 "The Future of Parliament"
natfra.59.d:0 "Opposition to parliamentary power, and to the parliamentarian establishment, has always been integral to Maurras's ideology. Now that we are in power, however, we need a practical solution to the problem of parliament, for which Maurras has received two proposals. The orthodox view within the AF is that the Assembly should be abolished outright, though some believe that it would now be more politically expedient to reduce it to an advisory body, devoid of much power but useful to maintain confidence in the government."
natfra.59.a:0 "We have no need for such a worthless body."
natfra.59.b:0 "They'll do fine as an advisory institution."

natfra.60.t:0 "A Classical Curriculum"
natfra.60.d:0 "With Maurras's government having committed to promote a revival of classical culture and ideals, it is essential that the youth learn these principles. As such, a new education law has been passed, establishing a new curriculum for students in France. From now on, classical languages, philosophy, and history will be greatly elevated in the curriculum, and become compulsory for every child. By instilling in the youth the values of the ancient world, we will doubtless restore its greatness."
natfra.60.a:0 "There is nothing better to learn."

natfra.61.t:0 "The Future of Immigration"
natfra.61.d:0 "The Action Française has always staunchly opposed immigration, identifying unassimilated immigrants, or, in Athenian terminology, "metics" as one of the "four confederated estates" of the Anti-France. However, the party is now divided over how exactly to solve the problem of immigration. One proposal, inspired by Maurras's emphasis on Mediterranean civilisation, is to restrict immigration to those from Latin countries. On the other hand, some within the government believe we should ignore national origin, provided that all immigrants are made to assimilate into French culture and only small numbers are taken in. Others, meanwhile, want to end immigration outright"
natfra.61.a:0 "Limit it to Latin countries."
natfra.61.b:0 "Managed numbers and assimilation will do fine."
natfra.61.c:0 "End it entirely."

natfra.62.t:0 "The Fate of Protestant Missionaries"
natfra.62.d:0 "Protestantism, the religion of the German filth and an affront to the essentially Latin hierarchies of the Catholic Church, has long been identified as a key part of the Anti-France by Maurras. Thankfully, the African territories have no substantial Protestant population which could threaten our government, but there are nonetheless many Protestant missionaries, especially in the Sub-Saharan colonies. Although many want us to stamp out these seditious preachers lest they turn the natives against us, many of the missionaries are Anglicans supported by our English and Canadian allies, so some are urging us to pragmatically leave them be, lest the Entente Cordiale is strained unduly."
natfra.62.a:0 "Leave them alone, we should avoid upsetting the Canadians."
natfra.62.b:0 "The Canadians need our ships and troops more than a few Priests."

natfra.63.t:0 "Combatting Freemasonry"
natfra.63.d:0 "Freemasonry, as a highly secretive international network which stands opposed to the Classical ideals of the Action Française, has always drawn the party's ire, and is identified by Maurras as one of the four estates of the Anti-France. It goes without saying that the time has come to shut down the Masonic lodges around our territory, and to ban the practice.\nMany of course would like to go further still, and take this opportunity to round up known Freemasons, as well as uncovering those who have kept their affiliations hidden: many have associated with or supported liberal movements, and with Masonry banned none of them will sympathise with us now. Others, however, argue that such an operation would be extremely costly, and it's always possible that we could simply fail to find much evidence against them."
natfra.63.a:0 "Banning Masonic activity from now on will be enough."
natfra.63.b:0 "We can take no chances: round up known Masons and expose the others."

natfra.64.t:0 "The Crémieux Decree Repealed"
natfra.64.d:0 "Now that we have largely dealt with France's other enemies, we can turn to what many view as the most insidious of all her foes: the Jews. The Action Française came into being amidst the Dreyfus Affair, and Maurras's ideology has always criticised their influence over France. In Algeria, meanwhile, all Jews have been French citizens for decades now, something that has consistently drawn anger and resentment from the natives.\nBut no more: today, His Majesty formally repealed the Crémieux Decree, which first granted citizenship to the Jews of Algeria. Natives around the country have celebrated the news, and Maurras's allies in Ferhat Abbas's AF-inspired Action Algerienne have congratulated the government, and promised to redouble their efforts to improve cooperation between Arabs and Frenchmen."
natfra.64.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.65.t:0 "Aristocratic Restorations"
natfra.65.d:0 "The French aristocracy, in spite of its long and proud history, has long been humiliated and repressed by the Republic. However, this can go on no longer: the aristocracy has a vital role to play within Maurras's ideal of an orderly, hierarchical society, and French aristocrats are almost universally monarchist, and generally sympathetic to the AF. As such, the government has set about restoring legal recognition of aristocratic titles, and with it restoring the French peerage, to ensure a loyal and organic government."
natfra.65.a:0 "Let the nobility resume its good work for the nation!"

natfra.66.t:0 "Pogroms in Algiers"
natfra.66.d:0 "In the aftermath of the repeal of the Crémieux Decree, anti-Semitic sentiment has been galvanised in Algeria, both among Arab nationalists who have long resented the special treatment of Jews and Frenchmen sympathetic to Maurras's rhetoric.\nAlthough most Jews are now leaving the country, for Germany, Palestine, or even the Commune, those that are stayed are increasingly being attacked, with anti-Jewish demonstrations increasingly common. These are now descending into violence, something that most integralists have little objection to, and thus many believe the government should endorse the demonstrations. However, some in the government are worried about international condemnation, and thus urge us to reign in the demonstrators before it grows out of hand."
natfra.66.a:0 "Their complaints are justified: encourage them."
natfra.66.b:0 "Put a lid on it now before it becomes embarrassing."

natfra.67.t:0 "Breaking up High Finance"
natfra.67.d:0 "For too long, the rootless and corrupt agents of global finance have sought to enslave people around the world, separating them from faith, culture, and tradition. Now, however, we can begin to put a stop to this: today, by order of the King, the assets of countless prominent banks and non-French businessmen were seized.\nNow that the state is in control of their wealth and businesses, we must decide what to do with them. Some believe that we should redistribute it to loyal Frenchmen, while others argue that to prevent another spiral into corruption, the state must maintain control over these businesses, and can spend the money on new projects."
natfra.67.a:0 "Give it to patriotic Frenchmen."
natfra.67.b:0 "Maintain state control."

natfra.68.t:0 "Supporting Native Elites"
natfra.68.d:0 "In order to entrench acceptance of French rule, the government has moved to extend Maurras's ideals of localism and decentralised government to Africa, consolidating the longstanding alliance between French colonial rule and native monarchs and chiefs. As such, we must find a place for these native leaders.\nSome within the government believe that it would be fitting to make them Peers of the Realm, on an equal footing to French aristocrats, while others believe it would be better to give them nominal self-governance over their lands, on the condition of loyalty to the French Crown."
natfra.68.a:0 "Make them French noblemen within the Kingdom."
natfra.68.b:0 "Give them autonomy in exchange for loyalty to France."

natfra.69.t:0 "An Offer from de Gaulle"
natfra.69.d:0 "General Charles de Gaulle, despite not being an active supporter of the Action Française, has nevertheless had monarchist sympathies for some time, seeing a King as a positive figure for national unity, and has also had some admiration of Maurras. As such, he was notable in his enthusiasm at the Restoration, and has been instrumental in encouraging his colleagues in the army, particularly his mentor, Pétain, to accept the new state of affairs.\nNow, de Gaulle has reached out to the AF, asking that, in his capacity as Chief of Staff, he be given increased powers to control the Armed Forces, and be further included in government decisions on national defence, foreign policy, and military spending, in practice bringing him into the Cabinet.\nMost of the AF is pleased at his sympathies for the government, and is enthusiastic at the idea, though others argue that he deviates too far from the party's ideology to be trusted."
natfra.69.a:0 "Bring him into the government, we need allies."
natfra.69.b:0 "We can do without moderates in powerful positions."

natfra.70.t:0 "Winning Over the Church"
natfra.70.d:0 "With the Action Française having greatly consolidated its position as the French government, one last major obstacle remains: the Catholic Church. Although Catholic conservatives have historically been supportive of French monarchism, and the AF's rhetoric has favoured State Catholicism, relations with the Church have been regrettably strained by the fact that Maurras, and many other prominent figures in the AF, are agnostic. Maurras's support for State Catholicism, meanwhile, comes from his admiration for the Church's hierarchy, which he sees as embodying the hierarchies of Latin civilisation, and his belief that shared Catholicism would help hold France together.\nThis has always been perceived as opportunistic and cynical by the Church, and, although the anti-Clerical policies of the Commune have caused the Papacy to restrain itself from openly condemning the AF, the Church has little love for our government, and has been greatly reluctant to support us after our coming to power.\nOf course, this situation must be remedied, something for which we have received three proposals. Many believe that if Maurras and others could convert to Catholicism, and renounce their earlier disparaging comments about Christianity, the Church will be placated. On the other hand, many believe that an offer to defend the Church from the syndicalist menace would bring them around. Others, meanwhile, argue that we should simply remind the Church of the Commune's anti-clericalism, and of our support for State Catholicism, opportunistic or otherwise, to present ourselves as a lesser evil."
natfra.70.a:0 "If Maurras joins the Church, they'll have nothing to complain about."
natfra.70.b:0 "An offer to defend the Papacy can hardly be refused."
natfra.70.c:0 "Remind the Church that the Communards will be worse than us."

natfra.71.t:0 "Charles Maurras Joins the Church"
natfra.71.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, Maurras has converted to Roman Catholicism. This goes a long way to placating our prior worries about the AF, and many now believe that we should improve relations with the French exiles, and work towards signing a new Concordat."
natfra.71.a:0 "Very well, let's reach out to the French."
natfra.71.b:0 "Maurras's conversion is as opportunistic as his earlier writings."

natfra.72.t:0 "An Offer from the French"
natfra.72.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, French diplomats have contacted us with an offer to protect us from the Italian socialists, in exchange for the Church softening its relations with the AF and working towards a concordat. Although many believe that this would be a betrayal of our principles, the dominant view in the Church is that Maurras is by far a lesser evil compared to the Syndicalists, and that State Catholicism, even if the reasons for it are opportunistic, is far better than socialist anti-clericalism."
natfra.72.a:0 "Very well, let's reach out to the French."
natfra.72.b:0 "We can't sell out like this."

natfra.73.t:0 "An Message from the French"
natfra.73.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, French diplomats have contacted us, stating that they are aware of and understand the Church's concerns about the Maurras government, but that the blatant anti-clericalism of the Commune would be far worse, and it is in the interests of the Church and of French Catholics that we soften relations with the AF, and work towards signing a concordat. Although some are sympathetic to this message, many believe that accepting the AF's suggestions would be a betrayal of the Church's principles, especially given that the AF has not offered to do anything in exchange."
natfra.73.a:0 "They're a lesser evil compared to the Commune, we should reach out to them."
natfra.73.b:0 "We can't trust Maurras."

natfra.74.t:0 "The Church Accepts"
natfra.74.d:0 "Excellent news has reached Algiers today, as the Holy See has accepted our diplomatic advances, and announced its intention to sign a Concordat with the government of the Kingdom. It seems that what concessions we offered them have paid off, and that they have accepted the fact that we are far better for French Catholics than the Communards ever could be. This will greatly strengthen the hand of the government, as many conservative Catholics once skeptical about the AF will come around to us."
natfra.74.a:0 "Brilliant!"

natfra.75.t:0 "The Church Refuses"
natfra.75.d:0 "Disappointing news has reached Algiers today, as the Holy See has refused our diplomatic advances, seemingly unimpressed by the fact that we would be a better government for French Catholics than the atheistic Commune, and not interested in the concessions we offered. This may greatly weaken the AF government in the long term, as the support conservative Catholics will be even further out of reach, and many of our political allies in the military or other monarchist groups, and even the royal family themselves, may lose confidence in the government."
natfra.75.a:0 "A disaster!"

natfra.76.t:0 "An Offer From Deloncle"
natfra.76.d:0 "With more moderate royalist sympathisers such as de Gaulle increasingly sidelined, we have been approached with a new offer of collaboration from Eugène Deloncle, a former member of the Action Française who became disillusioned with Maurras's inaction in the years before we came to power, and who grew more sympathetic to newer nationalist ideals prevalent in Italy, Romania, Russia, and elsewhere.\nNow, however, Deloncle appears enthusiastic at the death of the republic and restoration of the monarchy, and, in spite of his differences, is willing to work with our government.\nHe does indeed appear to have a lot to offer us: he seemingly has contacts throughout the military and intelligence services, and many like minded loyalists willing to aid him. In exchange for some political influence and concessions, Deloncle claims, he will be able to use his connections to pacify what remains of the opposition, and even infiltrate the Commune."
natfra.76.a:0 "He could be a valuable ally, give him the go-ahead."
natfra.76.b:0 "We can't trust this terrorist."

natfra.77.t:0 "The Colonel's Coalition"
natfra.77.d:0 "Having been appointed Premier by Maréchal Pétain to restore confidence in the regime and rebuild popular support, François de la Rocque now needs to find political allies, if he is to have any chance of consolidating power. As such, he today announced on the steps of the Assembly that he and his cabinet would work towards forming a new government of national unity, intended to bridge political divides and reunite the nation, alongside an anti-corruption push.\nIt is expected that this initiative will be supported by Pétain's other allies in parliament, such as Louis Marin's Fédération Républicain, and many have pinned their hopes for a restoration of order and unity onto de la Rocque. President Pétain as well is said to have high hopes for his new premier, though some of his loyalists worry that de la Rocque's power and popularity is eclipsing Pétain's own, and that his political manoeuvrings lack presidential oversight."
natfra.77.a:0 "We'll need to find allies..."

natfra.78.t:0 "Marin Joins the Unity Government"
natfra.78.d:0 "After many smaller nationalist and conservative parties and independents pledged their support of de la Rocque's unity government, today Louis Marin, leader of the conservative and Catholic, but avwoedly republican, Fédération Républicain, did the same, assuring de la Rocque of the support of his party. Although Marin himself hopes to amass influence for himself and his party within de la Rocque's government, many predict that his alliance with the Croix-de-Feu will simply see his movement absorbed and eclipsed."
natfra.78.a:0 "Only time will tell."

natfra.79.t:0 "The Special Premieral Powers Act"
natfra.79.d:0 "With de la Rocque's unity government having absorbed the smaller rightwing parties, the Fédératon Républicain, and many delegates from the Alliance Démocratique, there was little opposition today when he passed through the Assemvly a new Special Premieral Powers Act. The Act expands on the State of Emergency declared by Foch in 1919, giving the Premier special powers to enforce the State of Emergency and to maintain order.\nIn practice, this has concentrated extraordinary power in de la Rocque, and it is clearly him, not Pétain or anybody else, who is in control. The nation only waits to see what he will do with his newfound control over the state."
natfra.79.a:0 "We can trust the Colonel."

natfra.80.t.degaulle:0 "A Meeting with de Gaulle"
natfra.80.t.darlan:0 "A Meeting with Darlan"
natfra.80.d.degaulle:0 "Over the past months, the acceptance of Charles de Gaulle's proposals for military reform has propelled him to a position of great influence within Pétain's clique, and, by extension, within the government. As such, it is vital to secure his loyalty.\nWith this in mind, de la Rocuqe today met with the General, his fellow Great War veteran, and a man who shares many of his Catholic and nationalistic beliefs, in spite of de Gaulle's past sympathies for monarchism.\nThe two men were able to find much common ground, and de Gaulle has agreed to support the civilianisation of the junta under the Croix-de-Feu, in exchange for greater investment in the army, and greater autonomy for the general staff."
natfra.80.d.darlan:0 "Over the past months, the acceptance of François Darlan's proposals for military reform has propelled him to a position of great influence within Pétain's clique, and, by extension, within the government. As such, it is vital to secure his loyalty.\nWith this in mind, de la Rocuqe today met with the Admiral, his fellow Great War veteran, whose rapid rise through the French navy during the 1920s and 1930s, and involvment with Pétain, has caused him to develop nationalistic and anti-parliamentarian ideas shared by de la Rocque.\nThe two men were able to find much common ground, and Darlan has agreed to support the civilianisation of the junta under the Croix-de-Feu, in exchange for greater investment in the army, and greater autonomy for the general staff."
natfra.80.a:0 "We would be nothing without the heroes of the military."

natfra.81.t:0 "Our Friends in Business"
natfra.81.d:0 "Throughout the Croix-de-Feu's history, the party has been supported by many patriotic and right-leaning businessmen, and in its early days the party depended entirely on financial support from the successful perfumer François Coty. De la Rocque has always maintained good relations with the business community since, and Coty for his part has already been rewarded with the post of Minister of Finance.\nHowever, de la Rocque has many backers beyond Coty himself, and they all want something in return for their donations and support. De la Rocque is of course grateful for their contributions, and is eager to repay them somehow, but many of his advisers, and the remaining military men in the government, believe that bringing loyal businessmen into the government en masse would likely be seen as corrupt."
natfra.81.a:0 "Their loyalty has been essential: reward them with government positions."
natfra.81.b:0 "We don't want to be seen as corrupt, just favour them for contracts."

natfra.82.t:0 "Allegations of Corruption"
natfra.82.d:0 "Over the past months, several wealthy businessmen have received notable government posts, something that has not gone unnoticed. The remaining newspapers that have submitted to neither us nor the old junta have printed embarrassing details of longstanding Croix-de-Feu supporters being given favourable contracts and government jobs, while other businessmen are overlooked.\nDe la Rocque's allies in the business community, whose reputations have been harmed even more than de la Rocque's, are urging the Colonel to stamp out the dissent now, before we have to deal with a repeat of the earlier protests.\nOn the other hand, many of the Colonel's allies in the party and military believe that it would be more effective and sustainable to launch anti-corruption campaigns, restoring public confidence in the regime, and  preventing us from growing too dependent on big business."
natfra.82.a:0 "Crush the rumours before this becomes an issue."
natfra.82.b:0 "Win them over with anti-corruption measures."

natfra.83.t:0 "Coty's Complaints"
natfra.83.d:0 "Over the past months, several wealthy businessmen have been greatly disappointed by the government's refusal to give them overtly favourable treatment, in spite of their past support for the Croix-de-Feu. Although François Coty has continued to do well, and remains influential in his post as Finance Minister, he has grown frustrated by the treatment of his fellow businessmen and political allies, and is now demanding greater concessions to big business.\nMany of de la Rocque's allies believe that we should accept Coty's demands without guaranteeing as many concessions as he might have wanted earlier, but others argue that by continuing to reject his and his allies' advances, we can finally break free from the influence of big business."
natfra.83.a:0 "Make some concessions to keep them happy."
natfra.83.b:0 "The state does not exist to serve only the wealthy!"

natfra.84.t:0 "The Enemy Within"
natfra.84.d:0 "For years now, the Croix-de-Feu has staunchly opposed the influence of "hidden socialism", claiming the existence of a vast socialist conspiracy against the French nation and its leaders, and arguing that the Maréchal's government has been infiltrated and betrayed by Communard sympathisers.\nNow, on the back of the Special Premieral Powers Act, Colonel de la Rocque today pushed through the Assembly, with the support of a clear majority, the Special Counter-Socialist Measures Act, giving the government and Deuxieme Bureau extensive powers to investigate and crush syndicalist infiltration.\nWith the valiant officers of the law already setting to work cracking down on socialist spies and their Arab nationalist puppets, the nation will be made secure in no time."
natfra.84.a:0 "Justice will be served."

natfra.85.t:0 "The Radicaux Exposed"
natfra.85.d:0 "Today, a shocking truth came to light, thanks to the determined work of the Deuxieme Bureau. The Parti Radical, supposedly a safe and well-intentioned Republican party, has been thoroughly infiltrated by Communard agents ever since the exile.\nIt has always been well-known that the Party splintered at the tie of the revolution, with its left wing staying on in the Commune, but what has been kept hidden up to now is that the party leadership has maintained contacts with their former colleagues in the métropole ever since. The security implications of this are, of course, horrendous, and the pa's leadership is being rounded up and questioned, with both Cammille Chautemps and Édouard Daladier already behind bars and their party soon to be dissolved.\nAs we seek to pick up the pieces of this shocking revelation, we can only hope that their co-conspirators are soon found and dealt with."
natfra.85.a:0 "Ban this insidious party!"

natfra.86.t:0 "Dealing with the Action Française"
natfra.86.d:0 "As we continue to investigate Communard infiltration, the plot has only thickened, and it appears that the right has been as thoroughly manipulated as the left.\nGeorges Valois and his Cercle Proudhon were close to the Action Française, and to Charles Maurras himself, before the revolution, and it appears that they never really fell out, with many AF men found to have maintained contacts with members of Valois's "Sorelian" movement in the Commune, allowing sensitive information to reach the reds in Paris.\nMaurras, Pujo, and several other prominent AF politicians have been rounded up by the police, and the party's membership is outraged at their leaders' treachery, and will likely now turn to the Croix-de-Feu itself as the true party of French nationalism."
natfra.86.a:0 "I want these traitors behind bars!"

natfra.87.t:0 "The Whole Truth"
natfra.87.d:0 "As politicians and parties across the political spectrum have been investigated and exposed for their connections to the Commune, it has become clear that some malicious individuals must have co-ordinated and covered up these efforts. Given how long this infiltration has gone on for, such individuals can only be exceptionally high-up in the government.\nAs such, countless long standing aides and advisors to Phillipe Pétain have been rounded up, and are currently under investigation as we seek to find the Communard agents among them.\nIn practice, this has left Pétain cut off from many of his nominal loyalists. The Maréchal's public appearances have lately declined anyway, and with de la Rocque having forged his own alliances with the army, and in control of the Assembly, many now wonder how much power Pétain really has."
natfra.87.a:0 "De la Rocque will save the nation from these saboteurs!"

natfra.88.t:0 "An Arab Wing"
natfra.88.d:0 "As we seek to further expand the mass party of the Croix-de-Feu, a proposal has reached de la Rocque that we create a new wing of the party, to represent the Arab population in Algeria. Especially as we attack the Action Française, which had some sympathy among the natives, and as we only tighten the taxation and conscription of Algerians in anticipation of the liberation, many believe it would be politically expedient to win their loyalty, though others argue that it would be a waste of funds, and in practice largely futile."
natfra.88.a:0 "We need the Algerians' support, go ahead."
natfra.88.b:0 "We can't spare the money for this endeavour."

natfra.89.t:0 "Incentivising Party Membership"
natfra.89.d:0 "As the government seeks to bolster membership of the Croix-de-Feu, it will be essential to ensure that party membership is common among civil servants, and other government employees. One proposal to encourage membership is to give party members subtle pay rises, and to make this practice an open secret, inspiring people to join. On the other hand, it has been suggested that party members could be favoured for promotions, and for government jobs in the first place. Meanwhile, we could also simply make membership a legal requirement, though this would likely cause some controversy."
natfra.89.a:0 "Increase the salary of known members."
natfra.89.b:0 "Give members better opportunities for promotions and employment."
natfra.89.c:0 "Make membership mandatory."

natfra.90.t:0 "Enshrining Corporatism"
natfra.90.d:0 "Colonel de la Rocque, with the backing of all that remains of the Assembly, and the acceptance of the increasingly isolated Maréchal, has now committed to creating a new constitution for the French nation, to better organise it for the liberation and beyond.\nThe first step in establishing the new legal framework for the Colonel's state has, to the surprise of few, been the official establishment of a Corporatist system of government.\nThe first part of the constitution to be agreed on and ratified by the government has established a system of collective management of businesses, with unions controlled by the state, and the representation of unions and government officials on company boards, to ensure fait and collective management of industry."
natfra.90.a:0 "This will ensure stability better than any market or revolution."

natfra.91.t:0 "The Presidential State"
natfra.91.d:0 "As the drafting of the constitution continues, the government has now agreed upon the system of government that it will enshrine: a Catholic and Presidential republic.\nEver since Foch took over the government in 1919, the Republic has seen governmental power concentrated in the Presidency, but so far Pétain has had to operate through unofficial or pseudo-legal means.\nHowever, some wonder if he will ever make use of these new and extensive powers: the old Maréchal's public appearances have grown more and more infrequent, and he seems to have little to no influence on the drafting of what is being widely called the "Colonel's Constitution"."
natfra.91.a:0 "Only strong leadership can save France."

natfra.92.t:0 "A Social Republic"
natfra.92.d:0 "Today, by a unanimous vote of the Assembly, the new Constitution of the newly-christened République Sociale Française was adopted, and signed into law by President Pétain. The constitution formally adopts the conservative, Catholic, and corporatist agenda of the Croix-de-Feu, creating a Presidential corporate state.\nHowever, far from strengthening the current President, this constitution has finally brought his political career to an end. After ratifying the constitution, Maréchal Pétain confirmed that he was retiring from political and military life, to the unanimous applause and gratitude of the Assembly.\nIt had been no secret that de la Rocque had gradually stripped away Pétain's influence since becoming Premier, but the retirement of the man who has dominated French politics since 1929 has still come as a surprise to many, though most of the population hopes that fresh leadership will strengthen the country.\nFrançois de la Rocque was soon declared Pétain's successor as President, and in a long and successful speech vowed to do his utmost to liberate France."
natfra.92.a:0 "Adieu Pétain, et Bienvenue de la Rocque!"

natfra.93.t:0 "The Old Union Officials"
natfra.93.d:0 "Now that the government has assumed control over the trade unions and re-organised them into the CSPF, we must decide what to do with the officials of the old independent trade unions. Although we cannot deny their organisational skill and experience, these men were largely aligned with the Parti Radical or Parti Républicain-Socialiste, both of which have long had poor relations with de la Rocque.\nAs such,we must decide what to do with these men. Some believe that they should be given jobs equivalent to their old positions in exchange for loyalty, while others believe that we should tightly vet them. Others, meanwhile, argue that we should simply get rid of them all."
natfra.93.a:0 "Let them stay on if they swear loyalty."
natfra.93.b:0 "Tightly vet them for socialist sympathies."
natfra.93.c:0 "We can't trust any of them."

natfra.94.t:0 "What to do with Pétain?"
natfra.94.d:0 "Over a month has passed since Pétain, having seen his political influence slowly swept away from under his feet, resigned the Presidency to make way for de la Rocque. The Maréchal has stayed on in his military post since then, but has now informed the government of his intention to also retire from military life, though he hopes to continue his career in some form. We could keep him busy by giving him a diplomatic posting, or make him a parliamentarian (a largely ceremonial role since the new constitution concentrated power in the presidency). On the other hand, some believe it would be more advantageous if Pétain fully retired."
natfra.94.a:0 "He'll do fine as a senator."
natfra.94.b:0 "Make him our ambassador in Ottawa."
natfra.94.c:0 "Pressure him to retire entirely."

natfra.95.t:0 "A New Concordat"
natfra.95.d:0 "Ever since 1789, France's relations with the Catholic Church have frequently been strained, with successive governments attacking Catholicism. This only grew worse in 1905, when the republican government broke all ties with the Church.\nToday, however, this was set right, and François de la Rocque, having arrived in Rome the day before, signed a new Concordat with the Catholic Church, restoring Roman Catholicism as the state religion of France. De la Rocque has been congratulated for this by the Pope, and the Croix-de-Feu, always the party of the Catholic right, will likely be greatly strengthened."
natfra.95.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.96.t:0 "Anti-Semitism in the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.96.d:0 "As the Croix-de-Feu expands, we must address the question of anti-semitism among the party membership. Although de la Rocque has condemned anti-semitism in the past, and has good relations with the Chief Rabbi Jakob Kaplan, he has also been known to condemn Jewish immigration into the African territories, and has opposed the settlement in Algeria of Jewish refugees.\nMeanwhile, the Croix-de-Feu, as a nationalist mass movement, has inevitably attracted many members with anti-semitic dispositions, and as such party members are growing increasingly divided on the matter of anti-semitism.\nDe la Rocque is thus being urged by many moderates to condemn anti-semitism again, though others believe that this would hinder our efforts to absorb former Action Française supporters."
natfra.96.a:0 "We can't risk angering the radical right."
natfra.96.b:0 "We need to take a stance against these un-French sentiments."

natfra.97.t:0 "Opposition to Female Suffrage"
natfra.97.d:0 "Our recent move towards implementing female suffrage fulfills a longstanding goal of the French right, which has long supported giving women the vote, as they are seen as modest and pious, making them ideal Catholic conservative voters.\nHowever, this has also garnered much opposition, with some claiming that we are doing it only to bolster our share of the vote, even though elections are no longer worth much, and many others arguing that women simply do not have the political experience and social responsibility needed to have equal political power to men."
natfra.97.a:0 "Their complaints mean nothing."

natfra.98.t:0 "Promoting Le Flambeau"
natfra.98.d:0 "Le Flambeau has been the official newspaper of the Croix-de-Feu for several years now, loyally supporting the message of Colonel de la Rocque. However, it is of course only read by our loyal supporters, so it currently serves little use as a propaganda outlet.\nWith this in mind, two different solutions have been proposed to bolster the paper's circulation. First, we could use government funding to drive down its price, making it too cheap for independent newspapers to compete with. On the other hand, we could subsidise shops that sell the paper and promote it in their own ways."
natfra.98.a:0 "Drive down its price with government money."
natfra.98.b:0 "Give shops subsidies for selling it."

natfra.99.t:0 "Leisure for the People"
natfra.99.d:0 "Providing for quality popular leisure activities has long been a key policy of the Croix-de-Feu, and it today became a reality, with Colonel de la Rocque signing into law the creation of a new National People's Board for Leisure, which will supervise and arrange holidays, fitness activities, youth camps, and more besides, to reward the great people of France for their loyal service."
natfra.99.a:0 "A brilliant initiative."

natfra.100.t:0 "Le Petit Journal Purchased"
natfra.100.d:0 "On the top of our efforts to further popularise Le Flambeau, the Croix-de-Feu today purchased the longstanding and prestigious conservative newspaper Le Petit Journal. The newspaper, which is over 60 years older than our party, has a wide audience and is broadly respected, making it an ideal mouthpiece for the government's agenda and its message to the public."
natfra.100.a:0 "The people will be better informed than ever!"

natfra.101.t:0 "Le Redressement Français"
natfra.101.d:0 "As we further solidify the corporate state, we have been approached by an organisation called the Redressement Français, or French Renewal. Founded by the successful businessman Ernest Mercier on the advice of President Foch during the 1920s, the Redressement seeks to operate as a combination of a think tank and social club for prominent businessmen, promoting a pro-business view of corporatism alongside a traditionalist social agenda. Mercier has assured de la Rocque of his loyalty, and, citing their many shared ideals, has promised to do his best to round up support for the government among his associates."
natfra.101.a:0 "A worthy ally."

natfra.102.t:0 "The CSPF Established"
natfra.102.d:0 "Today, a special act promulgated by the rump assembly confirmed by de la Rocque has been brought into being the Confédération des Syndicats Professionnels Français, or French Confederation of Professional Unions. This new government entity will absorb all currently existing trade unions, bringing them under government supervision, with each profession represented by a state union within the Confederation.Under Roger Vitrac, the organisation will surely strengthen our support among ordinary workers, and ensure the representation of the common man."
natfra.102.a:0 "A vital component of the corporate state."

natfra.103.t:0 "Marin Retires"
natfra.103.d:0 "Today, in a lengthy speech in the Assembly, Louis Marin, leader of the Fédération Républicain, announced his full retirement from public life. Marin has led a long and successful career, leading the conservative FR for many years, and loyally supporting both the junta and now de la Rocque.\nHowever, under de la Rocque's unity government, he has seen much of his influence taken away from him, and his support largely absorbed by the Croix-de-Feu, inspiring him to retire to reduce future tensions within the government.\nNevertheless, Marin announced his full confidence in Colonel de la Rocque, and thanked the government for all its service."
natfra.103.a:0 "We shall all miss his dedication to France."

natfra.104.t:0 "Marin Seeks to Form a Coalition"
natfra.104.d:0 "Louis Marin may be the first civilian premier in seventeen years, but the military junta remains very much in place. Now, however, it seems that the veteran republican is working to change this.\nToday, in a large speech before the Assembly, Marin announced his intention to form a unity government of parties committed to the Republic, and his willingness to negotiate with any politician who shared his ideals of a democratic state.\nPresident Pétain is yet to comment on this development, but many of his supporters have reacted with alarm at what they see as the beginning of the end of the junta, while others believe that only this can restore political unity. Meanwhile, Marin's own allies are known to be in talks with a range of different democratic parties."
natfra.104.a:0 "Good luck, Premier!"

natfra.105.t:0 "Flandin Joins the Government"
natfra.105.d:0 "Today, it was announced to the public that Pierre-Étienne Flandin, leader of the centre-right Alliance Démocratique had joined the Marin government, after intensive talks with the FR's representatives. The news has surprised many, as the AD is a longstanding rival of the FR, and the parties have clashed before over the AD's secularism and more hardline free market policies. Nevertheless, this has set a clear precedent for broad cooperation between republican parties, and many now hope that more will join Marin's coalition."
natfra.105.a:0 "Excellent news."

natfra.106.t:0 "Daladier Joins the Government"
natfra.106.d:0 "It was announced today that Édourad Daladier, leader of the left-wing Parti Radical, had joined the Marin government, after intensive talks with the FR's representatives. The news has surprised many, as the PR's left-of-centre policies, despite having been toned down significantly after the revolution, have so far made it something of a bogeyman for the right, something not helped by its frequent opposition to the junta.\nNevertheless, Daladier and Marin have compromised sufficiently for the PR to take its place in the government, meaning that combined with the AD, the coalition now has a narrow majority in the Assembly, bringing the country closer to a parliamentary system than at any other point since FOch's coup.\nBy now, any move against the government by Pétain would generate outrage and only intensify the protests which Marin is slowly defusing, and so the Maréchal has little choice but to go along with the government's moves towards republicanisation."
natfra.106.a:0 "Now, we can set to work!"

natfra.107.t:0 "Pétain's Speech"
natfra.107.d:0 "With the pressure to either fully support or move against the new coalition having steadily built up, and Marin haing energised enough support to make a move against the coalition now a deeply risky measure, President Pétain has been left with little choice but to give the government his blessing.\nIn a lengthy speech today, the Maréchal re-affirmed his full trust and confidence in Premier Marin, and in the government he had assembled. Although Marin has already energised much popular support, this endorsement has come as a major boost to his popularity, and popular trust in the coalition is soaring."
natfra.107.a:0 "He chose the right side."

natfra.108.t:0 "Restoring Public Trust"
natfra.108.d:0 "As we seek to reassert parliamentary power, we must set about restoring public faith in parliamentarism: something deeply eroded by the revolution and exile, with the Assembly seen as weak and inactive.\nMany believe that the best and simplest way to remedy this is to increase the public appearances of major politicians, and to invest more in propaganda. Others, however, argue that if we are to truly escape our reputation for sluggish inaction, we should begin pushing through legislation at a faster pace, ensuring that this gains sufficient media attention. Meanwhile, there are some who argue that our best bet is to press Pétain to give the government more open support."
natfra.108.a:0 "Marin should fill his schedule with tours and speeches."
natfra.108.b:0 "Push through some token legislation at a fast pace."
natfra.108.c:0 "Get Pétain to double down on his support."

natfra.109.t:0 "How to Appeal to Officers"
natfra.109.d:0 "If our government is to stabilise and last, we need the support, or at least acceptance, of the military. Winning this, however, will be no easy task: under the junta, the military did of course amass much political influence, something they will be loath to give up, particularly to liberal-minded civilians.\nHowever, we must still make an effort to gain their loyalty, something which some suggest we should do by greatly increasing military spending, while others argue that decreasing parliamentary oversight of the military, and giving them more autonomy on investment and strategy, would placate fears that they will lose their influence. On the other hand, we could take a harsher stance, and threaten to investigate possible abuses under the junta if they do not comply."
natfra.109.a:0 "An increased military budget will keep them happy."
natfra.109.b:0 "Give them the final say on military affairs."
natfra.109.c:0 "Threaten to investigate them for the junta's abuses."

natfra.110.t:0 "Keeping Pétain Under Control"
natfra.110.d:0 "Philippe Pétain has dominated French politics since the death of Foch in 1929, but his obviously dictatorial and strongly presidential rule cannot continue if the Republic is to be maintained. As such, it is vital to restrain Pétain's authority, and ideally make him little more than a convenient figurehead for our own government.\nAs such, Marin has heard a proposal that his prominent loyalists in the military can be quietly posted to foreign advisory roles or the Sahara, and his aides reassigned across the civil service, thus cutting him off from allies who will try to preserve the junta.\nAlthough this proposal has gained much enthusiasm among those with whom it has been discussed, many others believe that this could be risky, and could lead to accusations of corruption or pushback from military loyalists. Thus, they argue that we should instead push through new laws that impose greater checks on executive power."
natfra.110.a:0 "Reassign Pétain's allies: we won't have him under control until he's isolated."
natfra.110.b:0 "Do it more legitimately, in spite of the opposition's complaints."

natfra.111.t:0 "Keeping Pétain Busy"
natfra.111.d:0 "As we seek to restore the Presidency to the ceremonial function that it was before 1919, we must find ways to keep Pétain occupied, keeping him from having the time to meddle in daily politics. As such, many of Marin's advisors believe that we should fill Pétain's schedule with public appearances and speeches, something which the deeply charismatic Maréchal will hardly object to, and which will also round up support for the government. On the other hand, the officers who have reluctantly thrown in their lot with us argue that it would be better for Pétain to focus on military affairs."
natfra.111.a:0 "Constant public appearances will keep him busy and gain us support."
natfra.111.b:0 "We need his military talents more than ever."

natfra.112.t:0 "The Judges of the Junta"
natfra.112.d:0 "With the government trying to resolve the corruption and intimidation that has long plagued the judicial system, we must confront the matter of the numerous judges who rose to and held their current jobs through their support for Pétain, consistently ruling in the favour of the junta and those associated with it.\nMany believe that it is time to turn over a new leaf and either remove or demote these judges, but others argue that they clearly have some administrative talent, which is in short supply and should not go to waste."
natfra.112.a:0 "Get rid of these corrupt frauds."
natfra.112.b:0 "For better or worse, we need their competence."

natfra.113.t:0 "Worries About the Release of Prisoners"
natfra.113.d:0 "With the government releasing many of the Pétain junta's political prisoners, some worries are being voiced about the possibility that various unsavoury elements will also be released, such as socialists or Algerian nationalists. These rumours have been greatly seized on by de la Rocque and Maurras alike, with both Le Flambeau and the Action Française printing stories about syndicalists and native rebels being allowed back onto the streets. Many believe that we should respond to this by tightening the requirements for release, and more closely examining individual cases, but others argue that the outcry has little basis in reality and will soon fade away, and we can thus safely ignore it."
natfra.113.a:0 "Their complaints don't matter, leave it be."
natfra.113.b:0 "Tighten the criteria for release."

natfra.114.t:0 "The Parliamentary Special Powers Act"
natfra.114.d:0 "Marin's government has consolidated itself more and more since cong to power, in spite of the military's resentment and the determined opposition of the nationalist right. However, the current state of affairs clearly is not enough for the republican parties.\nToday, Marin, cheered on by deputies from pro-republican parties of all persuasions, announced his intention to pass the "Parliamentary Special Powers Act", imposing severe checks on executive power and giving parliament the final say on almost all matters of state.\nThis has already generated uproar from the Croix-de-Feu and AF, while Pétain is yet to pass any comment.\nAlthough Marin's government has a majority in the Assembly, his own Fédération Républicain does harbour some deputies of more authoritarian persuasions, whose sympathies for a presidential state could well be galvanised through a concerted effort by the nationalists."
natfra.114.a:0 "We'll need a lot of luck to push this through..."

natfra.115.t:0 "Pushback from the Nationalists"
natfra.115.d:0 "Over the past days, both the Croix-de-Feu and Action Française have made a determined effort to prevent the Special Powers Act from passing. Their leaders have exhausted themselves with constant speeches and appearances, and their newspapers have focused all their attention on the "parliamentarian corruption" that the Act will supposedly entrench.\nMeanwhile, the parties' Dispos and Camelots have made a show of force in the streets, vigorously protesting the Marin government's policies, although the longstanding rivalry between the parties has made these protests rather tense affairs.\nWith the opposition going nowhere, the pressure is only mounting on Marin and his allies."
natfra.115.a:0 "Ask the Maréchal for his support."

natfra.116.t:0 "Meeting with the Maréchal"
natfra.116.d:0 "With the pressure to secure a majority for the Parliamentary Special Powers Act having become unsustainable, and needing to outdo the nationalists' propaganda campaign, Louis Marin today met with Philippe Pétain at the Presidential Palace in Algiers. Marin explained the critical nature of the situation to the old Maréchal, whose own political power has been steadily dismantled by the government.\nAlthough Pétain can do little concrete to ensure that the bill would pass, a tacit endorsement from him would go a long way to gaining a majority for the bill. However, the old Maréchal demanded some concessions: the Bill would be revised to include provisions for Presidential oversight over the workings of government, and to maintain the President's right to form new governments.\nWith little choice left, Marin could only agree."
natfra.116.a:0 "His endorsement will go a long way."

natfra.117.t:0 "The Act Passes"
natfra.117.d:0 "Today, after no end of debate and controversy, the Parliamentary Special Powers Act was passed by a very narrow majority in the Assembly. This has come as major news to the nation, and makes the most decisive step in Marin's government's consolidation of parliamentary power.\nHowever, the deep divides exposed by the Act will not go away. Opposition to parliamentary rule has galvanised support for the nationalist right, with both the Croix-de-Feu and Action Française emerging stronger than ever, having absorbed the old supporters of the junta. Meanwhile, some liberals were left dissatisfied with the concessions eventually made to Pétain.\nHowever, with the Act passed, parliamentary rule has been firmly entrenched in National France, and it cannot be denied that Marin's coalition has achieved what it had wanted to."
natfra.117.a:0 "Where next?"

natfra.118.t:0 "The Economic Policy of the Coalition"
natfra.118.d:0 "As we seek to reform French politics, we must also work to reform the economy, if we are ever to have the resources to liberate France. To this end, Marin has received two proposals.\nFirst, Paul Reynaud, deputy leader of the Alliance Démocratique, urges Marin to pursue a policy of economic deregulation, slashing taxes and provisions for workers' rights in order to enhance the "dynamism and productivity" of private business.\nOn the other hand, Camille Chautemps, an influential figure in the Parti Radical, wants us to pursue a program of state intervention and class co-operation, to ensure social stability and justice, and to prevent vested interests from hindering the liberation."
natfra.118.a:0 "Reynaud knows best."
natfra.118.b:0 "Chautemps's proposals are sound."

natfra.119.t:0 "Dissent Among Workers"
natfra.119.d:0 "Our recent moves towards economic deregulation have come at a heavy cost: many manual labourers around the country have grown increasingly discontented with the government. Feeling that Reynaud and Marin's policies are selling them out and leaving them more vulnerable to exploitation, many have become more sympathetic to the corporatism of the Croix-de-Feu or AF, which has the potential to cause our government much damage in the long term."
natfra.119.a:0 "A troubling development..."

natfra.120.t:0 "Support From Business"
natfra.120.d:0 "Although many French workers have turned against the government, our policies have garnered much support among big business. Industrialists, pleased by their new freedom from excessive government oversight, are increasingly supportive of Reynaud's policies, and, by extension, the Marin government, something which will doubtless be a great boost to our influence in time to come."
natfra.120.a:0 "We are grateful for their backing."

natfra.121.t:0 "Deteriorating Business Relations"
natfra.121.d:0 "In spite of the economic growth it has caused, Chautemps's economic policies have come at a cost: many businessmen, despite their broadly liberal leanings, have become deeply dissatisfied with the government's increased regulation and pro-labour policies, which they claim limits their ability to generate profit and enrich the economy. This will likely be a blow to our government's popularity, as these businessmen may utilise their broader influence against us, and turn to the opposition."
natfra.121.a:0 "What a shame..."

natfra.122.t:0 "Winning Over the Workers"
natfra.122.d:0 "Although Chautemps's policies have caused us to lose the support of many in business, they have generated much support among the National French working class, with many manual labourers having shown support for Chautemps's ideals, and, by extension, the Marin government. This is especially convenient because it will come as a significant blow to de la Rocque and the Croix-de-Feu, who have long sought to build a mass movement of their own among workers."
natfra.122.a:0 "A crucial success."#

natfra.123.t:0 "A Re-Energised Legislature"
natfra.123.d:0 "Following the success of the Parliamentary Special Powers Act, and due to the ongoing efforts of Marin and his allies, initiative has greatly returned to the Assembly. With Pétain having long since accepted the loss of much of his power, having become reliant on the coalition to stay in place at all, and the Assembly having regained sweeping powers, the old system of rubber stamping the junta's demands truly has faded away, allowing for a rejuvenated and re-energised parliament at the centre of government."
natfra.123.a:0 "All is well once again."

natfra.124.t:0 "The Downsides of Loose Censorship"
natfra.124.d:0 "Although our move to loosen censorship has undeniably been the right thing to do, and will strengthen liberal and democratic movements, it has also provided our political enemies with more ability to openly criticise the government, playing into the hands of both Maurras and de la Rocque, who have ramped up their attacks on parliamentarism significantly. Furthermore even those more committed to democracy have gained new freedom to speak against specific government policies which they oppose, and to expose the wrongdoings of unscrupulous officials."
natfra.124.a:0 "A regrettable price for liberty."

natfra.125.t:0 "Confronting the Junta's Corruption"
natfra.125.d:0 "It was always an open secret across French society that the military junta, whatever its advantages, was deeply corrupt, with many an officer or loyal bureaucrat enriching himself through less than legal means.\nNow, as Marin seeks to eliminate mass corruption from the government, these unscrupulous individuals will finally lose the power which they have long abused, something especially beneficial because it will strike one last blow to the junta's support. In light of this, however, some are urging Marin to go a step further and remove many officials who cannot be proven to corrupt, but did support the junta, arguing that even if it is hardly justified, it must be done to remove the military's influence for good."
natfra.125.a:0 "Just remove the corrupt."
natfra.125.b:0 "Sack more junta loyalists too."

natfra.126.t:0 "Corruption in Our Ranks"
natfra.126.d:0 "With the Marin government firing and investigating corrupt officials en masse, concerns have been raised that many administrators on "our side", those more sympathetic to liberal republicanism, may also be tainted by corruption, something that could become deeply embarrassing for the government, and also greatly harm our administrative abilities. As such, it has been suggested that we turn a blind eye to the corrupt practices of the more sympathetic bureaucrats, although others staunchly oppose such double standards."
natfra.126.a:0 "Get rid of them as well."
natfra.126.b:0 "Turn a blind eye."

natfra.127.t:0 "Louis Franchet d'Ésperey Retires"
natfra.127.d:0 "Poignant news has struck the nation today, as Maréchal Louis Franchet d'Ésperey, hero of the Great War and Pétain's longstanding Chief of Staff, has gone into retirement. D'Ésperey is an old man now, and clearly feels unable to lead men in war as successfully as he did twenty years ago, and so few can blame him for stepping back.\nNevertheless, Pétain's government has lost a vital political ally, and a popular figure capable of rounding up support for the Junta. Furthermore, without the unifying figure of d'Ésperey, debates in the military are likely to come to the surface, as Pétain will be forced to choose a new Chief of Staff."
natfra.127.a:0 "Farewell to a true patriot."

natfra.128.t:0 "A Successor to d'Ésperey"
natfra.128.d:0 "Over a week has now passed since Louis Franchet d'Ésperey retired, and Pétain has still held back on announcing a successor. This is because d'Ésperey's retirement has robbed the military of a unifying and respected figure, capable of papering over the growing doctrinal divides, as a younger generation of officers seeks to find solutions to the military's decline.\nOn one side, General Charles de Gaulle and his allies are known for their conviction that the nation can, in its current circumstances, only sustain a relatively small army, and thus should focus on professionalism, and a high quality of training and equipment. Furthermore, de Gaulle is passionate in his belief that tanks are the future of warfare, and that the Army should develop elite armoured units which can achieve concentrated, rapid breakthroughs.\nOpposing de Gaulle's faction is a group of officers centred around Admiral François Darlan and General Maxime Weygand, who follow a more traditional approach, that is often more popular among the older generation of officers. Drawing on the traditional French ideal of the citizen-soldier, and the need for strong naval and air power in order to land in the métropole, they argue for as large an army as circumstances allow, alongside a greatly strengthened Navy and Air Force, with the three forces acting in greater co-ordination.\nBy now, however, the pressure from both factions of the military, from civilian politicians eager to see the military reform one way or another, and from public opinion, has grown too strong for Pétain to procrastinate any longer, and he must appoint a successor."
natfra.128.a:0 "A small, elite force is what we need: bring in de Gaulle."
natfra.128.b:0 "Darlan and Weygand will preserve our military traditions."

natfra.129.t:0 "The Extent of Colonial Conscription"
natfra.129.d:0 "With the liberation more and more imminent, we can no longer put off the question of the conscription of colonial subjects. The topic has long been deeply contentious, and a final decision on the matter has been avoided for years, in order to avoid criticism from colonialist hardliners and anger from the natives.\nNow, however, it is not long at all until we will dearly need manpower from the colonies, and we must confront the question of how tight our conscription requirements will be."
natfra.129.a:0 "We shouldn't betray our native supporters: go very easy on them."
natfra.129.b:0 "We don't need to squeeze them too much."
natfra.129.c:0 "A moderate set of requirements will appease most."
natfra.129.e:0 "The future of France is at stake: squeeze them hard."
natfra.129.f:0 "Conscript everyone we can: this is no time for moderation."

natfra.130.t:0 "A Bitter Truth"
natfra.130.d:0 "Having taken stock of our military and industrial capacity, we can no longer hide from a simple, harsh fact. As it stands, our economy and army are nowhere near what is required to successfully land in the métropole, and then defeat the Commune. Urgent and drastic reforms are urgently needed, and public pressure on Premier Janin is reaching a fever pitch.\nPétain himself is said to be deeply angered by the findings, demanding that Janin do something, and possibly growing more sympathetic to the voices within his government that want to see a further consolidation of the junta."
natfra.130.a:0 "We await Janin's move..."

natfra.131.t:0 "The Liberation"
natfra.131.d.paris:0 "After much bloodshed and turmoil, the métropole is finally back in our hands. After so much hellish war, we have at last freed our brothers and sisters, who lived for all too long under socialist tyranny, and Paris is ours once again.\nHowever, much turmoil lies ahead. The war devastated France, with our beautiful country now lying in ruins, and a far from insignificant part of the population is still misguided enough to sympathise with the socialists.\nWe have won the war, but now it falls to us to win the peace."
natfra.131.d.noparis:0 "After much bloodshed and turmoil, the métropole is finally back in our hands. After so much hellish war, we have at last freed our brothers and sisters, who lived for all too long under socialist tyranny.\nHowever, much turmoil lies ahead. The war devastated France, with our beautiful country now lying in ruins, and a far from insignificant part of the population is still misguided enough to sympathise with the socialists. Furthermore, France is now divided, and the question of how to reunify the nation lies before us.\nWe have won the war, but now it falls to us to win the peace."
natfra.131.a:0 "Let's set to work..."

natfra.132.t:0 "Socialist Resistance Rises"
natfra.132.d:0 "Although we have set France free, it is quite clear that not everyone in the nation sees it in those terms. A large part of the population was sufficiently misguided during the war to go beyond simply defending their nation, and actively supported the socialist regime.\nNow that the socialists have been toppled many of these men have gone underground, forming resistance cells and seeking to attack and undermine the legitimate government. Defeating these terrorists will be no easy task."
natfra.132.a:0 "Terrorist Scum!"

natfra.133.t:0 "Socialist Resistance Declines"
natfra.133.d:0 "With our forces having worked tirelessly to weed out and counter the resistance movements of former Communards, we are at last seeing results, as these groups increasingly lose strength, drawing public ire for their violent actions and struggling to successfully challenge the government. However, they remain strong in some areas, and it is vital that we stay vigilant."
natfra.133.a:0 "They'll be done for before you know it!"

natfra.134.t:0 "Socialist Resistance on its Last Legs"
natfra.134.d:0 "Our continued efforts against socialist terrorists are paying off more and more, with local branches of Communard resistance groups being weeded out, and our forces increasingly gathering more intelligence over those that remain. As such, the remaining resistance is rapidly fading away, and optimists predict an impending victory over the terrorists."
natfra.134.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.135.t:0 "Socialist Resistance Crushed"
natfra.135.d:0 "Finally, our security forces and troops have mopped up the overwhelming part of the socialist resistance against our legitimate government. With the political scene more broadly stabilising, this is a major success for the government, and one which we shall be sure to extoll in our propaganda."
natfra.135.a:0 "Brilliant!"

natfra.136.t:0 "The Looming War"
natfra.136.d:0 "Across the Mediterranean, storm clouds are gathering. Government offices in Algiers are being flooded with reports from the Métropole, informing us that a war between the Commune and German Empire is imminent, and that the socialist government is mobilising its troops in an effort to retake Alsace-Lorraine.\nEveryone in the government and command knew that this day was coming, but it still came as a major shock. The coming months and years will doubtless be the greatest test in all our history, and every true patriot will have to be prepared to give up everything, so that France may be free once again."
natfra.136.a:0 "We'll show those tyrants what we're made of!"

natfra.137.t:0 "Dealing With the Returnees"
natfra.137.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Revolution, some two million Frenchmen fled to Algeria from the emerging Communard tyranny. Over the next decade and a half, they built new lives in North Africa, with new homes, jobs, and in the case of younger exiles new families.\nNow that France has been liberated, however, these men and women expect to return to the métropole and resume their lives as they were before the revolution, including having their property restored to them. However, these properties have been used by others for years now, and locals would be loathe to give it up to those who they see as having conquered them.\nIn light of this, many in the government propose that we allow exiles to return to their old homes and regain their old businesses, on the condition that they give up ownership of the properties they gained in North Africa to the state, which can then invest profits from these properties in reconciling and compensating those who stayed in the métropole.\nNevertheless, there are many who believe that the returnees are entitled to their property unconditionally, while others would rather we established local committees to resolve property disputes more fairly."
natfra.137.a:0 "Restore exiles' rightful property in full."
natfra.137.b:0 "Restore it as long as they give up their African properties."
natfra.137.c:0 "Establish local committees to settle the matter."

natfra.138.t:0 "Riots Against Property Restorations"
natfra.138.d:0 "Clearly, our decision to unconditionally restore the property held by returnees before the Revolution has deeply angered many Frenchmen who remained in the métropole, who are now seeing property they have had for over a decade confiscated from them, with some even kicked out of their homes.\nAll too many people believe that they are entirely entitled to this property, and that our policies are little more than petty revenge. Before these protests get out of hand, we must settle on our response."
natfra.138.a:0 "Back down and make them give up African properties."
natfra.138.b:0 "These protests will fizzle out in time: ignore them."
natfra.138.c:0 "Crush this syndicalist rabble!"

natfra.139.t:0 "Returnees Want to Hold Onto their Property"
natfra.139.d:0 "Although our decision to allow those returning to the métropole to regain their pre-Revolution properties as long as the state assumed control of the properties they acquired in North Africa after 1919 appeared to be a reasonable compromise at the time, it has generated an unexpected amount of frustration among returnees.\nArguing that their properties in Algeria are entirely legitimate, and likening having to give this property up to socialist collectivisation.\nAs such, there are some who now argue that poorer returnees, who may well struggle to find employment in the métropole, should be allowed to hold onto their properties, while others argue that we should scrap the policy outright. Of course, there are still many who believe that once these complaints die down the policy will succeed."
natfra.139.a:0 "Back down and let them have their properties."
natfra.139.b:0 "Make an exception for poorer returnees."
natfra.139.c:0 "Stick to our guns."

natfra.140.t:0 "Inertia on Local Committees"
natfra.140.d:0 "Although our decision to establish local committees, with representation from both returning exiles and local inhabitants, which can settle property disputes on a case-by-case basis has been broadly accepted by both groups as the fairest way to resolve the matter, these committees have increasingly faced inertia as they struggle to reach judgements satisfactory to all parties.\nMany argue that this inertia is largely due to the fact that these committees have received little direction from [NFA.Capital.GetName] on how to resolve disputes, or who to favour. As such, we must now provide them with more extensive guidelines on how to settle claims."
natfra.140.a:0 "Favour returnees in the guidelines."
natfra.140.b:0 "Favour the locals."

natfra.141.t:0 "The Fate of Socialist Bureaucrats"
natfra.141.d:0 "The Commune required a vast network of administrators and bureaucrats to last as long as it did, and now that we have vanquished it we have to settle on our policy towards these men who enabled our foes to survive as long as they did.\nWhile many believe that it is the time to take vengeance on these traitors and put them all on trial, some argue that the less ideologically committed could be given new jobs in our administration, where their experience may prove vital."
natfra.141.a:0 "Purge the lot."
natfra.141.b:0 "Let off the lesser offenders."

natfra.142.t:0 "Housing the Homeless"
natfra.142.d:0 "The war to liberate France has tragically destroyed much of the beautiful nation, and now all too many good citizens are without any work or even housing. Resolving these people's plight must be an urgent priority for our government, and as such various proposals have been made for relief.\nThe most popular proposal is that we build new camps in which to house and process those who have been made homeless, before putting them in rebuilt housing when it is possible. On the other hand, some argue that we should make use of abandoned trade union and government offices as temporary accommodation, cutting costs but reducing the quality of life and ease of administration."
natfra.142.a:0 "Build new camps for them."
natfra.142.b:0 "Put them up in abandoned socialist offices.."
natfra.143.c:0 "Don't bother, they may well be traitors."

natfra.143.t:0 "Resistance Reprisals"
natfra.143.d:0 "During the war, the resistance which valiantly stayed on in the métropole to await our return came to control swathes of the country, forming the only reliable local administration as socialists were killed or fled and politicians had to stay in Algiers to be close to power.\nHowever, reports are now reaching [NFA.Capital.GetName] of heavy-handed policies adopted by these triumphant resistance fighters, with frequent tribunals of local socialists, or sometimes simply those with whom resistance members have grudges. Furthermore, the reliability of these trials has been heavily questioned, and the executions that often follow are seen by some as mere lynchings.\nThis matter is highly delicate for us due to our great debt to the resistance but also the potential embarrasment if news of this becomes more widespread, so we shall have to tread carefully."
natfra.143.a:0 "Reign this in before it causes trouble."
natfra.143.b:0 "Turn a blind eye."
natfra.143.c:0 "Their grievances are just: stand by them."

natfra.144.t:0 "What to Do With the Commune's Policemen?"
natfra.144.d:0 "As we restore order in the métropole, we will badly need a police force to assist us. However, professional policemen are in short supply as many need to remain in the colonies to maintain order there, and many others were conscripted and wounded or killed in the War.\nMeanwhile, however, there are thousands of policemen who did their jobs under the Commune, and would almost all be willing to resume their work for our government. Nevertheless, many hardliners argue that these men tainted themselves by serving the Communard regime, and that we should not allow them any influence now."
natfra.144.a:0 "Purge any policeman with socialist sympathies."
natfra.144.b:0 "Let them redeem themselves by helping us."

natfra.145.t:0 "The Soldiers of the Commune"
natfra.145.d:0 "In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Communard army, most soldiers were quickly detained by their own forces as prisoners of war, while some others fled to the forests and hills, either to continue their struggle or simply to avoid punishment. Now, however, we must decide on how to treat those soldiers that are in our custody.\nThere are some who argue that everybody who fought for the Commune is a war criminal and a traitor to France, although many argue that low-ranking common soldiers were only doing their jobs and, while their cause was wrong, they are Frenchmen too and deserve to be allowed to return home and receive the same benefits as our soldiers, like a military pension. Indeed, there are a few who believe that we could allow privates in the Communard army to re-enlist with us."
natfra.145.a:0 "Treat them all as enemy prisoners."
natfra.145.b:0 "Don't let them serve again, but treat them as veterans."
natfra.145.c:0 "Allow those with clean records to re-enlist."

natfra.146.t:0 "Trial of the Communard Officer Corps"
natfra.146.d:0 "With several months having now passed since the socialist surrender, the greater part of their officer corps has now been tracked down and arrested, and is now awaiting trial. In such extraordinary circumstances it is only to be expected that the state advise the judiciary on how to try these individuals, and thus many believe that they should be tried for treason en masse.\nHowever, others argue that those officers who were less overtly committed to the socialist revolution or less brutal should simply be consigned to hard labour, and in a few cases allowed to contribute their military knowledge to our own army."
natfra.146.a:0 "Allow the most spotless to advise us."
natfra.146.b:0 "Hard labour is fitting for lesser offenders."
natfra.146.c:0 "Try the lot for treason."

natfra.147.t:0 "Trial of the Union Administrators"
natfra.147.d:0 "Now that the Commune has fallen, the leadership of the traitorous trade unions that were guilty for the Revolution has almost all been rounded up and is in our hands. As such, the time for their trials is fast approaching.\nSome believe that lower-ranking officials, who were often just trying to make careers in the system around them, could be let off as long as they use their industrial knowledge and administrative skills for our benefit.\nHowever, there are many who are opposed to such a conciliatory approach and would like to see everyone given hard labour at the very least. There are also of course some hardliners who would have us arrange military tribunals, with inevitable verdicts of treason, for anyone we can."
natfra.147.a:0 "We could do with their know-how."
natfra.147.b:0 "Put them all on trial."
natfra.147.c:0 "Military tribunals await these scum."

natfra.148.t:0 "Trial of the Socialist Politicians"
natfra.148.d:0 "Pivert, Déat, Valois, Bucard, Thorez, Blum, Fauré, Battaile. All these vile names and so many others have stained our national consciousness for all too long, as their tyranny attempted to destroy all that is beautiful about the French nation.\nNow, however, the leadership of the Commune its the countless lackeys are almost all in our custody, and we have at last amassed the political capital to try them for their crimes. While it is inevitable that the most high-ranking will be executed for treason, their ministers and cronies are a matter of contention.\nSome are of the belief that a life of hard labour would preserve them as living memorials of treason while making them pay for years, while others argue that heavily publicised but fair trials would be the best way to expose the horrors they committed. Of course, there are many who want them publicly executed as soon as possible."
natfra.148.a:0 "Hard labour for life."
natfra.148.b:0 "Give them fair trials, though the verdict is inevitable."
natfra.148.c:0 "Public hangings are the least they deserve."

natfra.149.t:0 "The Division of France"
natfra.149.d:0 "The national building in Algiers today has been seeing lots of activity as many generals and ministers have been gathering together today for a meeting that will have very important outcomes. Where just the other day the French Tricolour and Eagle were flying proudly in the wind and on every street corner as celebrations for victory in the reclamation of their homeland was achieved, today it seems to be a much more somber mood among the hungover representatives. The reason being that the liberation has brought Nationalist French troops into contact with the Germans, and while both were sure to celebrate and drink together at this meeting, the politicians behind closed doors had a new migraine to deal with. The migraine of what to do with Germans being in their newly regained homeland.\n'We must push them out, to let them stay in our rightful lands is an insult to the journey here!' A general shouted, and gained applause from fellow military members. Another minister began his counterpoint right after, stating that to throw the diplomatic option out the window after all this would be the true insult to the newly liberated. Right when the arguments were getting heated between the two, a single notoriously pessimistic minister stated aloud that any sort of confrontation could mean disaster, as the French were not in a position on the front or African interior for a new set of hostilities. Ultimately after another hour of discussion on the situation and the representative’s confidence in this, the decision was made."
natfra.149.a:0 "Begin to mobilise, and prepare an ultimatum for our land."
natfra.149.b:0 "We can settle this peacefully, prepare to negotiate."
natfra.149.c:0 "We can't risk a conflict or crisis in this situation."

natfra.150.t:0 "The French Ultimatum"
natfra.150.d:0 "The German man sat on the balcony, drinking his coffee to help go with his breakfast bread roll, enjoying the view outside the Foreign Ministry’s office when he heard his adjutant knocking on the door to his room, saying he had urgent news. Answering the door to his adjutant he was handed a telegram that came from the German diplomat in Algiers, stating that he was handed an ultimatum by the French Foreign Minister over the lands the German army held in France. Realizing the urgency of this news, the German official quickly gathered together fellow important members of the Foreign Office and awaited the Kaiser. Sitting in a conference room the members quietly bickered among themselves over what they could do. Two members argued that they should flat out reject the ultimatum, while some stated that they could use this to their leverage and perhaps negotiate the French into a different offer. However, as the door opened and the Kaiser walked in, the talk died down and all members inside stood up stiffly to present the news to the Kaiser, and awaited his answer to the problem."
natfra.150.a:0 "We will never betray the sacrifices of those who died for this land!"
natfra.150.b:0 "Very well, but demand economic concessions in return."
natfra.150.c:0 "We can't risk a war with the French: fall back."

natfra.151.t:0 "The Germans Refuse"
natfra.151.d:0 "We have received a response from the German foreign ministry about our ultimatum, and it was the worst we could have feared. They have flat out refused to leave the lands they have occupied, and now it seems our nation is holding bated breath to see how our government responds to this denial of Full liberation."
natfra.151.a:0 "To war!"
natfra.151.b:0 "They've called our bluff: back down."

natfra.152.t:0 "The French Declare War"
natfra.152.d:0 "It seems our refusal has only angered them, for a few hours after our answer reached the French government, planes and infantry crossed the lines where our two nations' armies had stopped. It seems where just the other day our troops were drinking together in celebration of victory against the syndicalists was temporary as now their planes strafe our troops and hostile contact all across the frontline is being reported. If they wish for a fight, they shall receive one."
natfra.152.a:0 "Furs Vaterland!"

natfra.153.t:0 "The French Back Down"
natfra.153.d:0 "It seems that the French have backed down from their aggressive stance after we refused their ultimatum, with their troops not mobilizing and their government stating now was time to consolidate their liberated lands. Our ministers and Kaiser all take this as a diplomatic victory as they have ensured the fatherland has come out on top after all this."
natfra.153.a:0 "Another triumph for Weltpolitik!"

natfra.154.t:0 "The Germans Demand Concessions"
natfra.154.d:0 "The Germans have responded to our ultimatum for our lands back by sending their ambassador back to us with an offer. Sitting down and discussing, the German ambassador showed us that they would accept a deal, they would give us the land back in exchange we pay economic concessions for the effort the Germans put in during the second weltkrieg, alongside a demilitarized border to protect the German people. Now we must decide, is this the price to pay for getting the rest of our homeland back or is this an embarrassment we will not tolerate at the hands of the Germans?"
natfra.154.a:0 "A small price to pay."
natfra.154.b:0 "This is inadequate for the French people."

natfra.155.t:0 "The French Accept"
natfra.155.d:0 "The French have accepted our terms for giving back their lands, in exchange they shall pay us back through concessions. Our foreign ministers and diplomatic corps are celebrating this victory, for we have once again managed to keep peace while ensuring the Fatherland still comes out on top."
natfra.155.a:0 "Peace is maintained!"

natfra.156.t:0 "Our Next Move"
natfra.156.d:0 "It has become apparent to our government that after the rejection of the German offer to form a deal, the diplomatic option has been removed off the table. The German’s arrogance towards us and our attempts to reunify France have made it so now it seems continuing the war footing is the only way to truly achieve our dream. However the question stands about whether we are actually capable of continuing the war against another large opponent."
natfra.156.a:0 "To war!"
natfra.156.b:0 "We stand no chance in such a conflict."

natfra.157.t:0 "The French Back Down"
natfra.157.d:0 "It appears that after the French have rejected our offer, they also do not wish for a conflict so the status quo stands. This is a propaganda victory for our regime as it appears the French’s stubbornness is greater than their ability to come to a compromise for the good of their people."
natfra.157.a:0 "Their loss."

natfra.158.t:0 "The Germans Give In"
natfra.158.d:0 "Our government celebrates our diplomatic victory as the Germans gave into our ultimatum, leaving the lands we wished to gain in the liberation. Their troops are leaving our lands without a fight and we have flown the tricolor triumphantly over the Eiffel Tower in our rightful capital. Now we can fully begin rebuilding and cementing our rule over our newly regained lands."
natfra.158.a:0 "A crucial diplomatic triumph!"

natfra.159.t:0 "The French Want to Negotiate"
natfra.159.d:0 "Today the Nationalist French representatives in Berlin contacted our ministers with the help of a Canadian middle man. Wishing to strike a deal with the Kaiser’s government for the French lands, they invited the Kaiser’s diplomats to Bordeaux where both nations could discuss a change of hands for the French lands the German army took in the second weltkrieg."
natfra.159.a:0 "Let's see what their terms are."
natfra.159.b:0 "Don't bother."

natfra.160.t:0 "The German Delegation Arrives"
natfra.160.d:0 "The French foreign minister watched in silence as the German delegation walked into the boardroom. The snapping of the camera’s from all the reporters watching the Germans walk into the room was an annoyance to the minister, who previously had to satiate his nervousness with multiple smoke breaks in preparation of this moment. Now he had to put on a fake smile and nod to the diplomats on the opposite side of the table, who similarly had to fake positivity to this tense moment. Now the delegations open their notes and begin to discuss the opening of what will decide the future of both French and Germany’s relations as well as the many French people living on the side that the German army occupied."
natfra.160.a:0 "Let's see what they can offer us."

natfra.161.t:0 "Our Demands for the French"
natfra.161.d:0 "Arriving in Bordeaux our diplomats immediately got to working on some possible offers to give the French in exchange for their land back. We now have to choose which one is acceptable to the Kaiser for the exchange of land. First, Option A which asks for a demilitarised border and a promise of Non-Aggression. Option B  also asks for economic concessions from the French. Option C is requiring German garrisons remaining in the territory we give back to the French to ensure peace and the promised deal is actually gone through with on the French part."
natfra.161.a:0 "A promise of non-aggression, and a demilitarised border."
natfra.161.b:0 "Demand economic concessions too."
natfra.161.c:0 "Only if our troops stay in France can we enforce peace."

natfra.162.t:0 "The German Demands"
natfra.162.d:0 "The Germans have finally stopped the diplomatic sidestepping in the conference and given us their official demands. They ask for a DMZ alongside the border of Nancy to ensure Security of the Germans within those lands they took after the very First Weltkrieg. They also asked for a promise in the treaty we will sign of Non-Agression, where our leaders will have a connected red telephone with the specific intent of being able to call one another to ensure the promised peace will still stand."
natfra.162.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.162.b:0 "We can make no promises."

natfra.163.t:0 "The German Demands"
natfra.163.d:0 "The Germans have finally stopped the diplomatic sidestepping in the conference and given us their official demands. They ask for a non-aggression treaty alongside a demilitarized zone along the post-First Weltkrieg borders, giving us the land back. They also asked for economic concessions to repay their effort in the war, meaning we will likely have to devout a good bit of industry and our resources to repay the Germans for this land exchange."
natfra.163.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.163.b:0 "We shall never sell our country to the boches!"

natfra.164.t:0 "The German Demands"
natfra.164.d:0 "The Germans have finally stopped the diplomatic sidestepping in the conference and given us their official demands. They ask for a promise of peace between our nations where we will keep a demilitarized zone on the border of Nancy, as well as economic concessions to pay for the regained land. While we were just settling on understanding what the previous demands would mean, they gave us an even more radical demand. They also require the presence of German garrisons in the land they occupied after the war, to ensure the peace-deal and transfer goes along smoothly. Now we will have to decide if this is worth paying."
natfra.164.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.164.b:0 "A continued military presence would be an insult to the nation!"

natfra.165.t:0 "The Failure of the Bordeaux Conference"
natfra.165.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned to Berlin from Bordeaux, with the word of the French refusal of our offers arriving in the city beforehand. Although it is a shame to the diplomatic corps, the Kaiser had already prepared for the French and their notorious stubbornness getting in the way of an agreement. Organizing collaboration with the French mayors in our occupied area, as well as talking with French monarchist elements who were discontent with the syndicalist rule, we now have the foundation for setting up a state loyal to Berlin."
natfra.165.a:0 "Their loss."

natfra.166.t:0 "All Quiet on the Western Border"
natfra.166.d:0 "The German soldiers were having dinner on a hill in the French countryside, looking out at the town in the distance where the Nationalist French tricolor flies and where just a week before they had celebrated in front of cameras at the linking up of the two nation’s armies. Now the grenadier’s noticed the French soldiers they were drinking with before now didn’t come over to their side anymore, while also not letting citizens beyond the village of the French held territory. Meanwhile in Berlin, the German foreign minister was finishing up his dinner at the table after looking at a map of the territory both nations held and where it stopped once it reached the other. Although the French regime in Algiers had always communicated via using the Canadians as middle-men beforehand, now they haven’t talked in a while after they finished the fighting, not even offering further negotiations or talks on the border situation."
natfra.166.a:0 "Let's hope they stay that way."

natfra.167.t:0 "The Germans Refuse to Negotiate"
natfra.167.d:0 "The Germans have denied giving us our land back at the Bordeaux conference, stating that if we weren’t willing to accept a deal, then they would have no reason to give us the land back. Those words were feared and dreaded, however now it’s clear this is our reality, so now our government has to take a deep breath and think clearly. We could finally take up the generals' offers and retake our rightful lands via force, however war is dreaded. But it seems the other option is to just admit that our current reclaimed land is what we will have to deal with, as we don’t wish to compromise or go to war with the Germans. Now our leader has to make this titanic decision, a decision that will decide the fate of the future state of France."
natfra.167.a:0 "We have no choice: to war!"
natfra.167.b:0 "We can't afford such a conflict."

natfra.168.t:0 "Les Macquisards"
natfra.168.d:0 "Over the past few months, the resistance to German rule within our lands has greatly increased, coalescing into a loose movement known as the Macquisards, believed to be centred around the young aristocratic officer Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie, who has gone underground with his loyalists to coordinate operations against us.\nEven more worryingly, it appears that the National French regime in [NFA.Capital.GetName] has been funding de la Vigerie, and supplying his men with advisors and guns. As such, many believe that we should request further reinforcements from our backers in Berlin, though there are some who believe we can manage the situation by ourselves."
natfra.168.a:0 "Handle the matter ourselves."
natfra.168.b:0 "We can't afford such a conflict."

natfra.169.t:0 "[FRP.GetNameDef] Wants Reinforcements"
natfra.169.d:0 "It appears that the situation in [FRP.GetNameDef] is growing more and more unstable, with the French government coming under increasing attack from a loose resistance movement known as the Macquisards, dominated by conservative Catholics who sympathise with the National French in [NFA.Capital.GetName].\nAs such, the [FRP.GetNameAdj] government is now requesting that we send 35,000 more soldiers into their territory, under Walter Model, to pacify the countryside and secure their government."
natfra.169.a:0 "Very well: send Model."
natfra.169.b:0 "This isn't worth it."

natfra.170.t:0 "Model's Demands"
natfra.170.d:0 "Having been sent by Germany at the head of 35,000 reinforcements tasked with pacifying the country and fighting back the Macquisards, Walther Model has now made an extraordinary demand from the government: that he be allowed to form a new national military administration, accountable only to Berlin, with sweeping powers to eliminate all dissent.\nMost in the government believe that we have no choice but to give in, particularly since Model is known for his un-cooperative personality and the effectiveness of his forces could greatly decrease if he feels unmotivated to prop us up. Furthermore, Model makes no secret of his brutal intentions in defeating the Macquisards, and stepping aside for him may clear our own reputations."
natfra.170.a:0 "So be it: give Model control."
natfra.170.b:0 "This is too far."

natfra.171.t:0 "The Countryside Pacified"
natfra.171.d:0 "Finally, after extensive actions by our lately empowered forces, it appears that the Macquisard resistance has been broken. With the French countryside having been turned upside down by small detachments of troops equipped with flamethrowers and machine guns, the loose resistance to our government never stood a chance, and yesterday Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie was arrested and, following a military tribunal, hung."
natfra.171.a:0 "Brilliant news!"

natfra.172.t:0 "Forces in the Countryside Collapse"
natfra.172.d:0 "Shocking news reached [FRP.Capital.GetName] today: our forces in the countryside which have desperately attempted to crush the Macquisards have been roundly beaten, and are now in total collapse, with most trying to evacuate across the German border. This leaves [FRP.Capital.GetName] entirely cut off from support, and our government's days are, it seems, numbered."
natfra.172.a:0 "A catastrophe!"

natfra.173.t:0 "The Macquisards Storm [FRP.Capital.GetName]"
natfra.173.d:0 "The inevitable has now happened, and after two days of intense and bloody street fighting, the Macquisards have seized full control of [FRP.Capital.GetName], with Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie, at the head of a newly formed Emergency Government, declaring himself Provisional Chief of State, until the crisis can be resolved.\nDe la Vigerie makes no secret of his support for the National French in [NFA.Capital.GetName], and as such his government's best hope is that they will respond to his pleas for support and send in their forces to secure the country, although the Germans, having just lost a prized satellite, may well have other ideas."
natfra.173.a:0 "What now?"

natfra.174.t:0 "Macquisards Topple the [FRP.Capital.GetName] Government"
natfra.174.d:0 "It seems that our decision to fund the Macquisard resistance against the German occupation has very much paid off: reports have just reached [NFA.Capital.GetName] that after two days of intense fighting in [FRP.Capital.GetName], the Macquisards under Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie have seized control of the government, while the German forces chaotically fall back.\nDe la Vigerie has always been a staunch supporter of our legitimacy, and he carried out his coup with the intention of re-unifying France under our government. As such, there are many who believe that we should seize this valuable opportunity to send our forces into [FRP.GetNameDef] in order to save the Macquisards and realise the dream of re-unification. However, others fear that the government in Berlin will not take kindly to such a move."
natfra.174.a:0 "Move in before the Germans do!"
natfra.174.b:0 "Wait to see how Germany reacts."

natfra.175.t:0 "The National French Sieze our Lands!"
natfra.175.d:0 "Shocking news has reached Berlin: it seems that, following a violent coup by internal resistance groups, our French satellite has entirely collapsed, with an anti-German emergency government under Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie inviting the National French to take control of the country.\nNational France wasted little time in agreeing, and its forces have swiftly moved in and siezed strategic positions across our former prized territory, with our troops now in a chaotic retreat towards Elsass-Lothringen. Many want us to counter-attack and crush the scum in [NFA.Capital.GetName], though many fear that we're in no state for yet another war in France."
natfra.175.a:0 "We've lost the initiative: fall back."
natfra.175.b:0 "We shall never betray the sacrifices made for that land!"

natfra.176.t:0 "Macquisards Topple the [FRP.Capital.GetName] Government"
natfra.176.d:0 "Shocking news has reached Berlin: it seems that the German-backed government in [FRP.Capital.GetName] has been toppled by a loose resistance movement dubbed the Macquisards, with the nationalist aristocrat Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie forming a new independent government.\nDe la Vigerie, it seems, was funded by the National French in his coup, and now intends to hand over the country to their regime. Allowing this to go ahead would be a major humiliation, but some wonder how well-prepared we are for yet another war in France, particularly as our available forces have been thrown into chaos by the uprising."
natfra.176.a:0 "Fall back and let them have it."
natfra.176.b:0 "Send our troops in before National France does!"

natfra.177.t:0 "The Germans Fall Back"
natfra.177.d:0 "It seems that, with their Western forces thrown into chaos by the Macquisards' coup, the Germans have been unwilling to risk a protracted war, and have reluctantly retreated from France, in practice leaving the country to us. This is a massive victory for our government, both at home and abroad, and we can now set about working with de la Vigerie and his heroic patriots to build a great and united France."
natfra.177.a:0 "Brilliant news!"

natfra.178.t:0 "The Germans Attack"
natfra.178.d:0 "Our decision to wait and see how Germany responds to the Macquisard coup seems to have backfired, and the Germans have opted to hastily send in their forces to re-occupy their old possessions.\nBy themselves, de la Vigerie's forces stand no chance of holding off the German army, and if we do not intervene they would inevitably be crushed. However, coming to their rescue would mean war with Germany, and defeating the Boches would be no mean feat."
natfra.178.a:0 "We must save our fellow Frenchmen!"
natfra.178.b:0 "De la Vigerie is on his own."

natfra.179.t:0 "Crushing the Macquisards"
natfra.179.d:0 "Now that we have decided to fight off the Macquisard resistance ourselves, we must decide on our policy on how to stamp out de la Vigerie's traitors. There are many in the government who believe that our first priority should be to win the hearts and minds of the French people, by focusing on propaganda and avoiding excessive brutality. However, many in the military dismiss this as wishful thinking and believe that special powers to crush dissent must urgently be granted to the army."
natfra.179.a:0 "Focus on propaganda."
natfra.179.b:0 "Crush them, whatever the cost."

natfra.180.t:0 "Macquisards Crushed"
natfra.180.d:0 "It seems that our gamble of supporting the Macquisard resistance against German occupation has come to nothing. A brutal campaign of pacification by the Germans and their lackeys has stamped out most organised resistance, and recent reports indicate that de la Vigerie himself was recently hung after being captured.\nThe remnants of the Macquisards are now fleeing across the border into our territory, where they are welcomed as heroes, but the dream of French re-unification seems further off than ever, with every possibility exhausted and German relations at an all-time low."
natfra.180.a:0 "We shall never forget their heroism."

natfra.181.t:0 "National France Seeks to Improve Relations"
natfra.181.d:0 "Over recent weeks, the National French government has notably softened its rhetoric towards us, now that it has largely rebuilt its country and needs to rebuild its place on the world stage. They have now gone a step further, proposing that we establish permanent embassies in each other's capitals for the first time since 1914. We cannot afford another war in France, and the financial incentives of a new thaw in relations leave us with little reason to reject this opportunity."
natfra.181.a:0 "Very well: set up an embassy in [NFA.Capital.GetName]."

natfra.182.t:0 "Germany Agrees"
natfra.182.d:0 "Germany has given its blessing to our proposal for a permanent exchange of ambassadors, and the accomplished German diplomat Herbert von Dirksen has arrived in Paris as the German ambassador, while a large new embassy is being built.\nThis is a major step for greater collaboration between our two countries, and the French government makes no secret of its intention to further build on this accomplishment to secure a new trade deal with the Reich."
natfra.182.a:0 "A crucial diplomatic success!"

natfra.183.t:0 "The Franco-German Trade Deal is Ratified"
natfra.183.d:0 "Today, the two governments of France and Germany formally ratified an extensive trade deal, allowing for the free exchange of resources and goods across the border, and giving each country's businesses favourable terms by which to operate in the other.\nThis is an unprecedented step towards peace between France and Germany, and diplomats from both countries are increasingly optimistic about future relations, though it remains to be seen just how far the German government will go in the name of reconciliation."
natfra.183.a:0 "Brilliant news!"

natfra.184.t:0 "The Franco-German Trade Deal is Ratified"
natfra.184.d:0 "Today, the two governments of France and Germany formally ratified an extensive trade deal, allowing for the free exchange of resources and goods across the border, and giving each country's businesses favourable terms by which to operate in the other.\nThis is an unprecedented step towards peace between France and Germany, and diplomats from both countries are increasingly optimistic about future relations, though it remains to be seen just how far we are prepared to go in the name of reconciliation."
natfra.184.a:0 "Time will tell..."

natfra.185.t:0 "The French Request a Non-Interference Treaty"
natfra.185.d:0 "Today, the French government made an unprecedented request, inspired by recent thaws in their relations with us. They propose that we sign an indefinite treaty of non-interference, similar to those signed by various countries before the First Weltkrieg, in which we would promise not to attack each other, and to avoid meddling in each other's diplomatic affairs, including through the establishment of spheres of influence.\nAlthough many diplomats, particularly from the younger generation, are enthusiastic about the idea, as are many world powers observing events and German businessmen eager to expand into France, there are many in the military and Reichstag who are deeply wary of any reconciliation with the French, and who have not forgotten the horrific war that they plunged us into in 1939."
natfra.185.a:0 "Peace is in everyone's interests."
natfra.185.b:0 "This is a step too far."

natfra.186.t:0 "The Germans Accept"
natfra.186.d:0 "Today, we were notified by Ambassador Dirksen that the German government has accepted our proposal of a non-interference treaty, and intends to formally sign it soon. Although some details need to be ironed out, such as the exact borders of our mutual spheres of influence, and the legal status of former French colonies, this is a massive diplomatic success, and one which has earned us no end of praise around the world, with [NFA.GetLeader] declaring the agreement to signify "peace in our time"."
natfra.186.a:0 "Never again shall Europe be plunged into senseless war."

natfra.187.t:0 "The Germans Refuse"
natfra.187.d:0 "Today, we were notified by Ambassador Dirksen that the German government has refused our proposal of a non-interference treaty, and although they have every intention of good relations, cannot commit to such a major step so hastily.\nDespite the recent improvements in relations between our two countries, this has surprised few, as most saw it as inevitable that the perennial rivalry between France and Germany would come back to bite. Although we are still committed to soften relations with the Reich, from now on we won't get ahead of ourselves."
natfra.187.a:0 "Regrettable."

natfra.188.t:0 "Aggressive Rhetoric in France"
natfra.188.d:0 "It has come to the attention of the German government that aggressive rhetoric from the French government, regarding their former colonies and Alsace-Lorraine, is rapidly increasing, alongside increased conscription and re-armament.\nIt seems that our neighbours to the West are readying for another war, or at least another war scare, and are prepared to plunge Europe into a hellish conflict in the name of their petty irredentism yet again. If that is the case, then the Reich stands."
natfra.188.a:0 "A despicable affront to peace."

natfra.189.t:0 "The French Ultimatum"
natfra.189.d:0 "Today, what we have expected for months came to pass. We have been delivered a formal ultimatum by the French, declaring all our conquests of French territory from 1870 on to be illegitimate, and demanding the full return of Alsace-Lorraine and all the French colonies that we seized at the end of the Weltkrieg.\nAccepting this would be a national humiliation, and a symbol of surrender to French aggression, but the war that would ensue if we refuse could be truly catastrophic for the entire world."
natfra.189.a:0 "There is no way that we could accept this."
natfra.189.b:0 "Can we seriously cope with yet another war?"

natfra.190.t:0 "The Germans Refuse"
natfra.190.d:0 "Predictably enough, Germany has refused to flat-out to comply with our ultimatum, declaring it an affront to peace and decrying us as aggressors who would plunge the world into war yet again.\nThe more jingoistic members of our government demand that we now declare war on the Reich, as we threatened to do, in order to finally bring the Boches to justice for their crimes against France, but many doubt how well we would fare in such a conflict."
natfra.190.a:0 "Begin to mobilise for war."
natfra.190.b:0 "We can challenge German hegemony more peacefully."

natfra.191.t:0 "The Germans Give In"
natfra.191.d:0 "Clearly too exhausted and dispirited by the Second Weltkrieg to allow yet another war to break out, Germany has astonishingly given in to our ultimatum, and announced the full return of French colonies and Alsace-Lorraine to the French government, with their forces rapidly back from the relevant areas.\nThis is the greatest triumph our government has ever known: finally, after the spilling of so much blood, the German tyrant has been brought to its knees, and after decades under the Reich's boot, Alsace-Lorraine is free once again. Frenchmen across the country have already broken into wild celebrations at their nation's newfound ascendency on the world stage."
natfra.191.a:0 "Hurrah!"

natfra.192.t:0 "France Presses for Dunkirk"
natfra.192.d:0 "Now that the National French have rebuilt their country after the Second Weltkrieg, they have begun seeking to restore their position on the world stage. Hence, we today received a demand from the French government that we return the city of Dunkirk to them, though it is unclear how they will respond if we refuse."
natfra.192.a:0 "So be it."
natfra.192.b:0 "Never!"

natfra.193.t:0 "[From.GetName] Returns Dunkirk"
natfra.193.d:0 "Clearly the Belgian government has accepted our terms, with their diplomats indicating to us that they are happy to restore the port to us, and that their own forces and administration will leave the city soon. This is a key diplomatic success for our government, and will doubtless give us more prestige at home."
natfra.193.a:0 "Great news!"

natfra.194.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Return Dunkirk"
natfra.194.d:0 "Clearly the Belgian government has not been sufficiently intimidated by our terms, with their diplomats indicating to us that they are will in no way restore the port to us, and that our claims have no legitimacy. We must now decide on how to resolve this issue, with many now demanding a war to put these upstarts in their place."
natfra.194.a:0 "There is little we can do."
natfra.194.b:0 "Crush them!"

natfra.195.t:0 "The Caribbean Question"
natfra.195.d:0 "After the chaos of the French and British revolutions, our colonies in the Caribbean were merged into one West Indies Federation, which came to be politically dominated by the Anglo population, rather than the French. So far we have had to accept its existence nonetheless, due to our own inability to administer the land, but with France rebuilt there are those who want us to rethink our policy."
natfra.195.a:0 "Request the return of the French Caribbean."
natfra.195.b:0 "The status quo is just fine."

natfra.196.t:0 "France Presses for its Caribbean Holdings"
natfra.196.d:0 "Having rebuilt France and restored order around the country, our National French allies are now seeking the restoration of their former colonial holdings in the West Indies. Many believe that, as the Federation itself was only ever a provisional measure and the French population has often been discontented, we would do well to accept the French demands, though there are those who are more reluctant."
natfra.196.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.196.b:0 "That land is integral to the country."

natfra.197.t:0 "[From.GetName] Returns Our Caribbean Holdings"
natfra.197.d:0 "Clearly, our demands have had the right effect on the Caribbean government, which has been sufficiently intimidated or otherwise pressured in order to confirm that the former French colonies in the Caribbean will be promptly restored to the direct rule of our government. This is a major victory for us, and we are thankful for our allies' co-operation."
natfra.197.a:0 "Excellent!"

natfra.198.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Return Our Caribbean Holdings"
natfra.198.d:0 "Clearly, our demands have failed to have the right effect on the Caribbean government, which has had the audacity to refuse outright to restore any former French colonies to our direct control. Although this is a humiliating affront to our government, [From.GetNameDef] has the support of the British, and we cannot risk the Entente alliance by pressing the matter further."
natfra.198.a:0 "What a shame."

natfra.199.t:0 "Marin's Demands"
natfra.199.d:0 "For some years now, Louis Marin has used the influential position allowed to him by the Junta to work hard to legitimise Pétain's regime among French liberals, doing a great deal to round up support for military rule - if only as a provisional measure. In exchange, Pétain previously promised Marin that he would make good on this support, and restore the Constitution after France was liberated.\nAnd now that Pétain has indeed succeeded in liberating the nation, Marin and his allies in the Fédération Républicaine, alongside Croix-de-Feu politicians hoping for electoral success, and more left-leaning liberals, are all pressuring Pétain to follow through on his word, while his backers in the military look on with trepidation."

In exchange, Pétain previously promised Marin that he would make good on this support, and further shift towards a Catholic Presidential state after the Liberation.\nHowever, now that Pétain has succeeded, a tragic spanner has been thrown into the works. Last night, François de la Rocque was shot dead while giving a speech, in an attack by socialist partisans. This untimely death has left the junta vulnerable, without its main civilian backer to legitimise its rule during the Reconstruction of France. Some now believe that Pétain should look to the younger generation of officers, including his own Premier, to revitalise the government, while others, including the remaining Croix-de-Feu leaders, would rather Pétain moved to centralise power around himself."
natfra.200.a:0 "The younger generation will round up support."

However, Pétain consistently refused to make major concessions to either of these men, and over the years both started to drift from the junta.\nBefore the Liberation, this was hardly an issue, as the need for national unity in such a time of crisis was able to prevent their discontent from rising too high or causing trouble among the population. Now that France is back in our hands, however,  there is rising frustration with the Military Government, which is once again coming to be seen as stagnant and inert at a time when millions are hoping for a capable and determined government to handle the task of Reconstruction.\nSome of Pétain's advisors thus believe he should capitalise further on his own prestige, which luckily has not been greatly reduced by people's frustration with the junta, by going on a new tour of the nation. Others, meanwhile, believe that it is time he delegates more to the younger officers within his clique, as a way of showing that the junta still has life in it."

natfra.205.d.cdg:0 "With Pétain's junta having struggled to maintain its credibility, and Pétain himself having delegated more and more to his Premier, Charles de Gaulle, few were surprised today when the Maréchal formally announced his retirement from both military and political life. Nevertheless, the country has been taken by storm, with Pétain having now led the nation for over ten years and having thoroughly dominated political life throughout his time at the helm.\nIt was promptly announced that the Assembly, a rump parliament ever since the declaration of Martial Law in 1936, had unanimously chosen General Charles de Gaulle, a hero of both world wars and a staunch Pétain loyalist, as his successor as President. General de Gaulle, having grown up in a deeply Catholic middle class family and been influenced by the early writings of Maurras, is known for his monarchist sympathies, though it is yet to be seen whether he will follow through on a restoration of the Orléans Monarchy."
natfra.205.d.darlan:0 "With Pétain's junta having struggled to maintain its credibility, and Pétain himself having delegated more and more to his Premier, François Darlan, few were surprised today when the Maréchal formally announced his retirement from both military and political life. Nevertheless, the country has been taken by storm, with Pétain having now led the nation for over ten years and having thoroughly dominated political life throughout his time at the helm.\nIt was promptly announced that the Assembly, a rump parliament ever since the declaration of Martial Law in 1936, had unanimously chosen Admiral François Darlan, a hero of both world wars and a staunch Pétain loyalist, as his successor as President. Admiral Darlan is unique among the military men who dominate politics due to his naval background, something which he takes great pride in, arguing that the Navy was the only section of the Armed Forces which was not defeated in the Great War, and it is widely believed that he intends for his allies within the naval officer corps to dominate the new government."
natfra.205.a:0 "Pétain's heroic leadership will be missed by us all."

natfra.206.t:0 "The Rejuvenated Junta"
natfra.206.d:0 "It seems that, in spite of all the factionalism and instability which his government has faced, Maréchal Pétain has yet again managed to hold on to power. His opponents have been roundly discredited, locked up, or otherwise dealt with, and the overly ambitious members of his clique have been reminded of their place. Meanwhile, public admiration for the Maréchal has reached a new heigh.\nThe pressure on Pétain to make way for fresh leadership or liberalise has thus greatly lessened, and instead he has maintained the authoritarian and traditionalist rhetoric of the Révolution Nationale, promising the French people that corrupt and divisive Republican politics will never again hinder their interests."
natfra.206.a:0 "Without Pétain's rule, we would be nothing."

natfra.207.t:0 "Liberal Politicians Purged"
natfra.207.d:0 "Over the last days, Pétain's Junta has determinedly struck at its over-ambitious civilian associates, and Republican politicians as a whole. Liberal and progressive politicians who attempted to maintain a vague opposition to the Junta have at last been put behind bars, and even Pétain's backers in the Fédération Républicaine have been pressured out of their positions to make way for military men.\nWith this move, whatever its short term ramifications, the Junta has, if not endeared itself to the French people, shown them clearly that it still has both the will and abilitty to endure, and is immensely likely to do just that."
natfra.207.a:0 "A necessary measure for stability."

natfra.208.t:0 "Pétain Tours the Country"
natfra.208.d:0 "Over the past weeks, President Philippe Pétain has gone on an exhaustive tour of France, speaking to packed crowds multiple times a day in a - so far greatly successful - bid to restore public confidence in the Junta.\nPétain's invocation of French heroism in both world wars, and the need for a disciplined, orderly society rooted in strong moral values, has struck a deep chord with the French people, and his charisma has caused many to rally around him, greatly buoying the Junta's popularity."
natfra.208.a:0 "I want front row seats at his next address!"

natfra.209.t:0 "Liberal Parties Dissolved"
natfra.209.d:0 "By decree of President de Gaulle, every major liberal political party, from the Parti Républicaine-Socialiste to the Fédération Républicaine, was today formally dissolved and banned. This move goes far beyond previous crackdowns by the Junta, as it has even targeted parties which have, albeit pragmatically, backed the military government for years.\nThis sweeping purge has sent a very clear message: de Gaulle will waste no time in dealing with his opponents, and will do whatever it takes to build the strong, central executive of which he dreams, and which has now become far closer to reality."
natfra.209.a:0 "Civilian politics will divide us no more."

natfra.210.t:0 "Republican Leaders Rounded Up"
natfra.210.d:0 "Following the dissolution of the liberal-leaning parties of the Third Republic, a major crackdown has taken place on their leadership, with countless well-known grandees of Assembly politics and remaining critics of the Junta detained. Édouard Daladier and Camille Chautemps have both been charged with an array of offenses, while much of the AD's leadership is under house arrest, and even FR politicians are being investigated for various alleged plots against the State.\nThis is the most unprecedented move in de Gaulle's crackdown, and at last all opposition to the establishment of a fully empowered executive, capable of single-handedly leading the French nation onwards, has been quashed."
natfra.210.a:0 "A needed, if difficult, step."

The government, led by President de Gaulle, was quick to express its condolences for a national hero and brilliantly gifted naval commander, while a hasty investigation deemed that his death was a suicide caused by his struggling prospects within the military, and waning influence in the government.\nHowever, there are also those who suggest that this declining influence in the military and Junta, alongside Darlan's longstanding rivalry with de Gaulle, paints a very different, more sinister, picture of what led to his death. Thankfully for all good citizens, such mad ravings have struggled to catch on, and all such misinformation will be confronted rightly."

natfra.212.d:0 "With the old Constitution of the Third Republic, one centred around secularism and parliamentarism, having been suspended for years already, and de Gaulle having swiftly dealt with any who would like to see it restored, few were surprised today when the President announced a new Constitution for France, which realises his dream of a centralised and presidential state.\nMeanwhile, some have noticed that de Gaulle's lifelong instinctive sympathy towards monarchism has not, in the end, had blatant results, with the Constitution preserving the Republic under a strong President. However, those who know de Gaulle better argue that to him, a strong President and a strong King serve the same purpose: an effective, centralising leader, around whom the nation can rally."

natfra.213.t:0 "The Coronation of Henri VI"
natfra.213.d:0 "With de Gaulle's hold on power secured, it came as a surprise to few when, today, following weeks of legal preparation, Henri d'Orléans, Count of Paris and Orléanist pretender to the French throne, was crowned King in [NFA.Capital.GetName], in an elaborate ceremony modelled as closely as possible on traditional French coronations.\nAlthough de Gaulle and his Junta allies dominated the attendance, royalist intellectuals including Charles Maurras were also at the ceremony, alongside liberal politicians including Louis Marin, who de Gaulle had forced out of public life, showing that de Gaulle clearly intends the new monarchy to be a unifying force for all Frenchmen, aiding his plans of strong centralisation, and providing the military government with more legitimacy."
natfra.213.a:0 "Vive le Roi!"

natfra.214.t:0 "Policy Towards the Maurrassians"
natfra.214.d:0 "Our restoration of the monarchy has brought up the imminent need for us to decide on our policy regarding those who have led the calls for a restoration for decades: the Action Français. As a young man, de Gaulle, like many, admired Maurras, before drifting away from the AF as he developed his own centralist ideals, and rose through the Junta. Meanwhile, the strong emphasis placed by the AF on localism and decentralisation - indeed, Maurras first became a monarchist out of his regionalism - contrasts sharply to the direction of de Gaulle's policies.\nThis leaves us with a difficult decision before us: our new Kingdom will lack legitimacy if it hardly has the support of French monarchists, but gaining their support would compromise the ideals which inspired de Gaulle to establish the Kingdom in the first place. As such, some believe that we should allow Maurras and his allies to gain advisory positions in the government so long as they agree to accept centralism, although they would inevitably continue to privately advocate for some level of localism. Meanwhile, others would rather we sidelined the Maurrassians entirely, and worked to promote our own brand of centralist monarchism."

natfra.215.t:0 "The Question of the Croix-de-Feu Leadership"
natfra.215.d:0 "President de Gaulle's decision to forgo his own monarchist instincts, and instead secure a centralised Presidential dictatorship, has been welcomed with much enthusiasm by the Catholic Corporatists of the Croix-de-Feu, one of the few remaining legal political parties due to their consistent support for the Junta and their own authoritarian populism. Many thus believe that de Gaulle would do well to give Croix-de-Feu politicians a greater role in the government.\nHowever, the Party has long sought to form a populist mass movement of its own, with institutions such as paramilitaries, soup kitchens, and the innovation in French politics of official mass membership, to the point where it almost forms a state of its own for its members. Some within de Gaulle's government thus believe that the Croix-de-Feu is far too ambitious to be trusted with much power, and we should take steps to limit their influence before they get too big for their boots."
natfra.215.a:0 "Their popularity will feed into our own: give them what they want."

Deeply Anglophobic all his life, President Darlan has concluded that, with France liberated, we no longer have any need for an alliance with Perfidious Albion, whose interests encroach on our own across the world, and who rivals us for naval power.

natfra.220.t:0 "Controlling the Flow of Information"
natfra.220.d:0 "President Darlan's government has now made a far greater commitment to propaganda, and influencing the information consumed by the public. Darlan himself does not underestimate the value of effective propaganda, and those around him have now begun to debate what our method should be for ensuring that the people know and appreciate our version of events.\nSome in the government believe that the only rational solution is to introduce harsh censorship laws, and greatly expand our capacity to monitor what is published, and thus ensure thaat nothing seditious slips through the net. Others, meanwhile, argue that it would be less unpopular, less costly, and more effective, to simply increase funding for loyal media outlets which can put out our own narrative, at a greater rate and in more persuasive terms."

However, over the past century more and more Frenchmen abandoned the countryside for cities, offices, and factories, only to be cut off from their roots.\nIn order to remedy this, the government has began a programme described as "Return to the Fields", which seeks to encourage people to go back to ancestral rural areas.

Regional governments, made of what Maurrassian loyalists could be found, have been rapidly established across the Liberated territories. Due to the legislation passed before the Liberation, these governments already hold great deals of power within their regions.\n\nThis has not been as successful as it may appear, however, as, although Maurras's localist principles are now being realized, this has drastically weakened the central government - and thus his own authority - in a critical moment, when Maurras and his allies need to be safely in control of the government to rebuild France.

Deloncle was also able to use his extensive connections for the good of the nation, bringing around many of his associates in business to the Kingdom, and also persuading minor rightist politicians such as Joseph Darnand to accept Maurrassian leadership.\n\nWhile there are many in the government who believe we owe Deloncle a great debt for all his work, and argue that he would surely succeed should we give him the go-ahead for his proposals, there are many others who believe he is growing too ambitious, and some Camelot leaders are even calling for him to be dealt with more permanently."

The report states that he operated a terrorist cell for some time before the Monarchy was restored, and it was in this capacity that he first came into contact with his allies in intelligence and business, forming close connections with them due to like-minded views and aims. Furthermore, this report states that Deloncle is now preparing to seize full control, having been allowed by our government to greatly extend his influence throughout the State.\n\nMany of Maurras's advisors are now in a frenzy, demanding that Deloncle and his associates be rapidly purged, but there are also some who believe that the report is a fabrication, merely a result of junior intelligence officers chafing against the influence that Deloncle and his allies like Georges Loustanau-Lacau have in the secret services."

Deloncle's men stepped in, re-organising loyal army and Camelots forces, and securing government buildings across the city.\n\nWhen the main government offices were secured, however, Maurras and Pujo were found dead, seemingly slain by the socialist insurrectionaries.\n\nHimself lucky to have emerged unmolested, His Majesty [NFA.GetLeader] was quick to confirm Deloncle as Maurras's successor, with the saviour of the nation speaking to the French people this morning, to inform them of the last night's tragic affairs, and promise retribution against all those responsible."

Meanwhile, various associates of Deloncle, such as Georges Loustanau-Lacau and Eugène Schueller, have been quietly demoted or arrested on minor charges, and it seems that his clique is being steadily broken up."

natfra.241.t:0 "De Gaulle is Planning a Coup"
natfra.241.d:0 "Today, a report reached Maurras and his cabinet detailing the nature of Charles de Gaulle's activities over the past years. The report affirms what we already know about his politics: that although he is a monarchist, de Gaulle is no integralist, and desires a strong central government, making our rapid moves towards autonomy deeply alarming to him. Furthermore, this report states that de Gaulle is now preparing to seize full control, having been allowed by our government to greatly extend his influence throughout the State.\n\nMany of Maurras's advisors are now in a frenzy, demanding that de Gaulle and his associates be rapidly purged, but there are also some who believe that the report is a fabrication, merely a result of longstanding rivalries within the military, perhaps cooked up by Darlan and Weygand to get their opponents purged."
natfra.241.a:0 "This is pure fiction."

natfra.242.t:0 "De Gaulle Storms [NFA.Capital.GetName]"
natfra.242.d:0 "[NFA.Capital.GetName] woke up to chaotic scenes today, as military units, having moved into position over the past days, stormed the city, occupying administrative buildings and key locations before presenting the Maurrassian government with an ultimatum to transfer "Supreme Emergency Powers" to General de Gaulle.\n\nAfter hours of standoff, during which many Camelots vainly attempted to resist the putsch, Maurras surrendered, and was taken into custody by soldiers, although others such as Maurice Pujo managed to flee the capital. With the Royal Palace also surrounded, His Majesty [NFA.GetLeader] hastily confirmed de Gaulle as the new Premier, and stated his unconditional support for the new Provisional Government."
natfra.242.a:0 "A return to military rule, or something more?"

natfra.243.t:0 "Charles de Gaulle Arrested"
natfra.243.d:0 "In a chaotic scene in [NFA.Capital.GetName], Charles de Gaulle was arrested by pro-government forces, on extensive charges of treason, and plotting to topple the Maurrassian government. De Gaulle and his men initially tried to put up resistance, and a gunfight ensued, but they were unable to hold out, with de Gaulle surrendering to the police. His trial will inevitably be a forgone conclusion, but Maurras and his allies hope that de Gaulle will be able to incriminate his co-conspirators before going to the wall."
natfra.243.a:0 "Traitorous scum."

natfra.244.t:0 "Charles de Gaulle Found Dead"
natfra.244.d:0 "This morning, Charles de Gaulle was found dead at his home in [NFA.Capital.GetName], with a single gunshot wound. After some rumours of a socialist assassination, the police were able to rule out any such plot, and his death was ruled a suicide, with his anxiety over his position in the army given as the reason. Meanwhile, de Gaulle's closest allies in the military are being reassigned far from [NFA.Capital.GetName] and the centre of power, and it seems that his clique is being steadily broken up."
natfra.244.a:0 "He won't be missed."

natfra.245.t:0 "An Ineffective Opposition"
natfra.245.d:0 "Although our hasty moves towards local autonomy have caused some temporary instability, the prevalent mood in [NFA.Capital.GetName] is nevertheless one of optimism. Our loyal forces are steadily cracking down on those that have tried to challenge the government, and Maurras's regime remains consistent and united, without any internal subversion or divisions that could undermine it in this crucial moment. It seems to many that it will not be long at all until the crisis is entirely over."
natfra.245.a:0 "Hurrah!"

natfra.246.t:0 "De Gaulle Announces Elections"
natfra.246.d:0 "Today, General de Gaulle formally announced free elections in France, which will be held within a few weeks. Although many had predicted that his coup would simply lead to a revival of the military junta as it existed before 1936, it seems that de Gaulle believes a popular mandate would give him a stronger hand to implement his centralist policies. More importantly, de Gaulle also expects to be all but unopposed in this election, with no obvious opposition to his government having come to the forefront."
natfra.246.a:0 "True royal democracy is coming!"

natfra.247.t:0 "The Liberals Come Out of the Woodwork"
natfra.247.d:0 "De Gaulle's hopes to run unopposed in the coming election have now been dashed, with a new "French Liberal Front", formed from the remnants of the Parti Radical and Alliance Démocraticque, having announced its intention to run against him, with Maurras's purges seemingly having been insufficient in their ability to fully stamp out liberal politics.\n\nThe Front has been brought together under the leadership of a lesser-known political theorist, Bertrand de Jouvenel, who has been influenced by futurism and even various radical movements from totalists to legionnaires, while at the same time advocating for a liberalised economy and a democratic balance of powers. Coming from an old aristocratic family, de Jouvenel has also always sympathised with monarchism, and he now promises a Kingdom built on true democracy."
natfra.247.a:0 "The race is on!"

natfra.248.t:0 "One Name on the Ballot"
natfra.248.d:0 "De Gaulle's hopes to run unopposed in the coming election look set to come true, and no major candidate capable of challenging the incumbent Gaullist movement has yet emerged. Although the General's goal in holding these elections is to give his centralist policies a clearer democratic mandate, that intention has been mocked by some, as he is essentially guaranteed to win. Nonetheless, the government continues to portray these elections as a step towards genuine democracy in France."
natfra.248.a:0 "You'd be foolish to doubt us."

natfra.249.t:0 "Election Day"
natfra.249.d:0 "It is Election Day in the Republic and from Dakar to Tunis all true Frenchmen gather in the voting booths to make their voices heard. As they say in every single election in every single democracy every single time, this election is probably the most important in French history. As in every election, there are a wealth of options from about a dozen parties big and small for the citizenry to choose. However, while you can certainly vote for your preferred flavor of party so local it doesn't get more than a few votes in the next town if you want, there are only two real options. First there is de Gaulle who is treating this election more as a referendum on his actions than a true election, an election he of course expects to win. Seeking to reinforce his peculiar Republican Monarchist ideals, he has pledged to stay the course and to make the Monarchy responsible yet strong so France may weather the storms ahead. Facing him is the ‘Liberal’ faction of his clique led by Bertrand de Jouvenel. While they are still passively monarchists they feel a strong monarchy is a threat to France and want to take power away from the King and deregulate the economy. After hours of tense waiting the votes are counted and the winner is finally announced."

natfra.250.t:0 "Provinces Compete for Funds"
natfra.250.d:0 "Unfortunately France is sorely strapped for cash. It always has been to some extent but even more so now that we are all little more than sand farmers baking in this hell of a Continent. As we have given the provinces more and more freedoms they have begun to compete more and more fiercely for funding from the central government so they can more easily exercise that freedom. Due to a combination of influence and practicality, some provinces have gotten more of those precious funds than the others. The funding has been funneled into the more heavily populated (and white) coastal areas while the relatively poorer interior has been left to stretch a meager budget ever further. This has led to the interior growing more and more disillusioned with the Algiers government. Some rumors have even come in that some areas are plotting a wholescale rebellion if their needs aren't met. "
natfra.250.a:0 "They should be grateful for what they get."
natfra.250.b:0 "Pay off the more estranged provinces."

natfra.251.t:0 "Reallocating Funds from the Central Bureaucracy"
natfra.251.d:0 "As we begin to slash bureaucracy and free up funds we have found ourselves with a wholly unexpected problem. We have quite a bit of extra money on our hands without much more in the budget requiring us to spend it. Unfortunately if we do not spend it, it will simply be allocated away from our control in the next yearly budget. We have been presented with two black holes to shovel the money into. One of them is the military. This one is rather straightforward really. The Government will hand out generous cash incentives to defense companies to make them open up more factories. This will leave us better equipped to face our enemies in the future. Refreshingly simple in such ever complex times. The other money pit however has a more nuanced use. The previous regime’s centralization policies sucked money from the provinces like a parasite. This has left many provincial administrations stagnant, decaying and in some cases teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. If we were to funnel this extra money into their pockets we can give them the funds to potentially overhaul their administrations, kickstart the machines or at the very least keep the lights on another year. Not only that but some provinces have always had a waning allegiance to us. Burying them under a mountain of francs will buy us enough gratitude to keep them from wandering off at the very least."
natfra.251.a:0 "Spend the money on defence and the military."
natfra.251.b:0 "Use it to increase funds for each local government."

natfra.252.t:0 "The Threat of Divergence"
natfra.252.d:0 "As we have decentralized our state we have run into a problem we hadn’t really intended, much less expected, to find. Some provinces have begun to take their newfound freedoms a bit too literally and have begun to deviate from the national policy of Maurrassime. Some of these deviations are rather minor and pose more a theoretical threat than any actual harm to the social fabric of the nation. However some provinces, those farthest from Algiers usually, have taken extreme liberties with the pillars of Maurras’s ideaology and some have even abandoned it entirely. Our administration is split on what to do about this. One faction says we can do anything. We wanted the regions to be more free to choose their own policies and now that they have, to stop them would be hypocritical. Another proposes we have the King step in and bring the provinces into line. Maurras can make a public fuss but of course he is the King, what can Maurras do but carry out his word? It kills two birds with one stone, we can bring the provinces into line and keep our ideology untainted. A third and more radical faction proposes we just skip over the King and crack down on these ‘liberal interpretations’ outright. They preach doom and hellfire if we don't do something, and point out that saying how you would rule a nation and actually ruling it are two different things. Sometimes you must do the wrong thing for the right reasons. If people are mad now, history will vindicate us."
natfra.252.a:0 "We can't betray our principles."
natfra.252.b:0 "The King can intervene to dismiss them."
natfra.252.c:0 "Ban unorthodox policies."

natfra.253.t:0 "Incentivising Party Membership"
natfra.253.d:0 "Maurras has seemingly begun to take issue with the fact that the Action Francaise has remained, even after taking power, a realm for the upper crust. A majority of the card carrying party members are the upper crust of society. He has begun to worry that if the AF does not broaden its base it could give the Red Poison of Syndicalism a way in to pull the rug out from under all of us. He has devised three options on how to encourage the lower classes to join. The first one is the simplest, pay them. By giving bonuses to workers in the Party it can encourage those not in the Party to join. If not out of loyalty then out of greed. Sure it may let in some less than savory actors but Maurras is confident the Party can withstand a few bad actors clamoring up from the bottom rung of the social ladder. The second option is to use the tried and true method of propaganda. He has begun to draw up a massive multi-media propaganda campaign to convince the lower classes that the AF works for them as well as their richer betters. The campaign is all encompassing stretching from pamphlets to flyers to radio ads and shows to even a series of movies lionizing the AF in their heroic struggle for the soul of France. The last option is a bit more drab but probably more effective. We will restrict promotions to upper management and civil service to just those in the Party. Sure it will have the same pitfalls of paying for members, but growth is growth…right?"
natfra.253.a:0 "Offer more financial privileges in the Corporatist system."

natfra.254.t:0 "The Broader Rightist Press"
natfra.254.d:0 "While the Action Francaises newspaper, also called the Action Francaise, has become the most widely read newspaper in the nation, a collection of other right wing newspapers have maintained a decent readership. One of these is even the Libre Parole, the newspaper that caused the Dreyfus Affair. Their continued support of the regime has let them keep  their independence but that independence is seen by some as a threat. They warn Maurras that they could just as easily turn on him and sow the seeds of disunion and rebellion just as well as reinforce the national state. They urge Maurras to shut these papers down or to at least absorb them into the AF so they can’t pose a problem in the future."
natfra.254.a:0 "Absorb them into our own paper."
natfra.254.b:0 "Leave them be as long as they stay loyal."

natfra.255.t:0 "Darnand Joins the Government"
natfra.255.d:0 "Joseph Darnand is a patriot betrayed by the nation he loves so much. He had been a supporter of the right wing since the Weltkrieg and fought the Syndicalists during the Civil War. After the Fall of the Metropole he fled to North Africa along with all true Frenchmen and, like many disaffected right wingers, joined Maurras. However Darnand, along with Deloncle were increasingly marginalized by the liberal Maurras who disapproved of their more severe methods. Now however that dinosaur is extinct and Deloncle reigns supreme over the land. In an unexpected act of kindness, or maybe practicality since Darnand still holds immense sway in certain former Cagoule circles, he has asked Darnand to join his government. It was an offer Darnand accepted without hesitation."

natfra.256.d:0 "Modern France is a hive of Modernist and Revisionist perversion. If France is to be strong again these modern filth must be purged, cut out like the cancer it is! To that end Deloncle has ordered the beginning of the Social Revolution. The Revolution is all encompassing and thorough. All ‘anti-French’ books are to be burned in massive pyres. All ‘Modernist’ buildings are to be torn down and rebuilt along ‘traditional’ guidelines.Enemies of the state shall have their names and locations published, with the fanatic public to do with as they wish. All of this will be led by the newly inflamed passions of the Camelots du Roi. Like the knights of old they shall take up the sword and save France and shed the blood of those who wish to see her polluted. Some less fanatic members of Deloncle’s entourage have expressed worries about an inevitable revolutionary excess. Deloncel simply adds their name to the list."

natfra.257.t:0 "Camelot Radicalisation"
natfra.257.d:0 "Today in a mass rally in Tunis Maurice Pujo, staunch ally of Charles Maurras and leader of the Camelots du Roi, was removed from power in an overwhelming voice vote. The youth, enraptured by the passion and vitriol extolled by the Cagoule, then welcomed their new leader Gabriel Jeantet. Jeantet then had the entire stadium, all 100,000 young men and boys, take a blood oath to their leader Eugene Deloncel. They also took an oath to defend France from all enemies both foreign and domestic. Those domestic enemies were named too. Jeantet blasted the liberals, the intellectuals, the Jews, the blacks and the Arabs for weakening France and for defiling its holy mission.The Caomelots gathered that day as a youth organization like any other. They left that night a finely honed weapon aimed at the heart of France’s enemies."

natfra.258.t:0 "The Great Cleansing"
natfra.258.d:0 "Today reports have come in from across the nation of the Camelots taking matters into their own hands. Reportedly without prodding from their handlers gangs of Camelots have taken to prowling the streets of most cities and towns they operate in, hunting people they deem a threat to national security. Local dissidents, Jews, non-whites, homosexuals, artists, anybody they deem not traditional enough are quickly disposed of. Already the body count is in the thousands after just two days of blood shed. Some gangs aren't even waiting for the safety of the night, ambushing men and women in the street and beating them to death with their own bare hands in broad daylight before stringing them up as a demonstration for all to see. Terror grips the nation as anybody, even government officials, who try to step in are disposed of just as savagely. Yet, despite all the violence and terror the government does nothing. All is going according to plan."

natfra.259.t:0 "Nationwide Initiation Ceremonies"
natfra.259.d:0 "As Deloncle begins casting a wider net for allies, he has begun to authorize initiation ceremonies across the nation for the best and brightest. These ceremonies are described as a strange mixture of masonic and Jesuit traditions with Deloncle’s own ideas mixed in for good measure. In them new members are, in the presence of a Grand Master dressed in all red and his “assessurs” dressed in all black with their faces covered, had to face a table covered by a French flag on which was a sword and torches, raise their right arm and swear an oath  "Ad majorem Galliæ gloriam"("for the greatest glory of France"). This was very similar to the Jesuit oath Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam (For the Greatest Glory of God). It said that on any given day about a dozen are going on in cities all across France. Some are singular affairs with just one new initiate, some include as many as 10 initiates. However as the Cagoule’s numbers grow, their power grows in turn."

natfra.260.t:0 "Allegations of Masonic Influence"
natfra.260.d:0 "As the Cagoule begin to take on more and more outward Masonic attributes, many of Deloncle’s allies have begun to voice more and more anger in turn. The Masons are an ancient enemy of the French Right Wing and few, even now, are willing to let their old enemy gain any ground on them. They have begun to plainly call these policies “misguided” and “unfortunate” in papers but privately harsher words like “treasonous” and “degenerate” are heard just as frequently. This has reportedly caught Deloncle off guard. He himself has little love of the Masons and fought them hard both during his life in Exile and in the Metropole. While he has begun to clamp down on this growing dissent just as harshly as he has any other, it really seems to have gotten to him. He has begun to quietly roll back some of the Masonic looking attributes of the organization and has begun to comb through his inner circle looking for any molecule of Masonic taint so it may never again seep into his organization."

natfra.261.t:0 "Maurice Pujo Killed"
natfra.261.d:0 "Today reports have come in of an unexpected flavor. While most of the Camelots du Roi have quietly been rolled into the new administration a militant and active section split off under their old leader and Maurras ally Maurice Pujo. Until now they have remained a small group and as such were limited to acts of minor sabotage like booby trapping roads and stealing supplies. However, a routine desert patrol in the Algerian desert came across an until now unknown oasis. Further investigation revealed the oasis was an old Action Francaise base which was being used by Pujo and his clique as a main hub. What followed was a short but ferocious gunbattle as the desert patrol, unprepared for the gunbattle, used their light weaponry but superior training to fight their way through the town. After thirty minutes and 1243 rounds of ammunition fired, the battle was over. Maurice Pujo got away but fled deeper into the desert. Without any allies and trudging alone into the Sahara it's safe to say he will not be bothering the government anymore."

natfra.262.d:0 "Today Charles Maurras’s trial has come to a close. In the blockbuster six month trial Maurras was hammered again and again and again with a litany of charges ranging from the benign like conspiracy to commit a crime to the deathly serious like treason. In the end the result was never in doubt. After just a few minutes of deliberation the jury returned a sentence of guilty. This was immediately followed by Maurras shouting “C'est la revanche de Dreyfus!” (It’s the revenge of Dreyfus!) and motioning angrily to the jury. Irregardless of the intentions of a long dead man a sentence has yet to be handed down. President De Gaulle has secretly told the judge that he would like him to be lenient on the man since de Gaulle was once an admirer of his and even now still held some affection for him and his ideals. Others say that Maurras has committed crimes too grievous to be let go with just a slap on the wrist. They publicly demand that Maurras be executed. For the good of France. A third and more moderate faction instead has a different view. They too want Maurras to be lightly punished, but not because of some short sighted affection but because the AF is still a potent force. They point out if Maurras is executed it is likely to start an insurgency that the government would be hard pressed to destroy."

natfra.263.d:0 "Today in a victory speech in Paris Bertrand de Jouvenel has laid out his vision for the new France he seeks to build. The speech was long and lacked a strong charismatic flare but in its banality it hid an ambitious program. He wanted to restore a liberal and balanced democracy where the King shared power with a strong judicial and legislative branch. Not only that but he wanted to launch a comprehensive and thorough deregulation of the economy, opening it up to outside investment and, hopefully, jump-starting an economic machine that is already threatening to stagnate. This would be backed up with a robust social safety net for the poor and downtrodden, justified by Jouvenel not wanting them to stop being consumers. In the end however, his vision for France is one of a kind and gentle state whose robust social safety net, light but still present national authority and free economy will lead to an economic windfall for all Frenchmen and women."

There have been some accusations of vote tampering but his popularity is real and his supporters are passionate so if de Gaulle had to tamper with the numbers, he wouldn’t have had to do much. In his speech he laid out a plan that was to be expected. Firstly he spent a good amount of time praising the nations, and by extension his, achievements so far. He touted the increased production in the factories, the growing army and the defeat of “Maurras and his gang”. Next, when it came to talking about what came next, he spoke about staying the course. He pledged to further consolidate power in the capital to keep splitters and rebels from tearing apart the last bastion of France. He also pledged to keep the economy stable, a promise that drew wild cheers. For all the political tumult that had gripped France in the past decades, many average citizens still worried more about their checkbook than their government. De Gaulle stabilized the ever fluctuating economy and let the average Frenchman's savings account more than double. He was also clear that more trouble lay ahead. The Metropole still suffered under the Syndicalist yoke. He then made another, fateful promise. He swore on his and the honor of all of France that he would not leave office until he could do so from the Elysse Palace. That brought forth a roar of approval so loud legend says they heard it in Paris."

These slaves came to form a political elite within Liberia, and dominated politics, ruling over the natives through their True Whig Party. While this nation's affairs have rarely been much concern to us, we have come to rely on them more for trade since the Liberation, making major happenings in Liberia of greater importance to the government in Algiers.\n\nRecently, the political status quo in Liberia has come tumbling down following the exposure of widespread slavery, for the profit of Americo-Liberians and white businessmen. This crisis culminated in the Masonic Grand Lodge of Liberia, which had already been greatly influential in the TWP behind the scenes, openly siezing power through a coup.\n\nOur nationalist government has long viewed Freemasonry as a Satanic institution, and a mortal threat to the French people, and now that one of our regional trading partners is openly controlled by Masons, many want us to step in and restore order.

The doctor, arriving within 15 minutes of the call, then worked on the Colonel till late in the night. Afterwards, in a press conference the doctor assuaged fears that the colonel was dying and said that the situation has been stabilized with the cause being a Heart Attack due to exhaustion and stress. Experts have said that the President will be back on his feet within 5 days and asked the public to not spread panic and discord among our nation at this crucial moment in time.

Promising Heaven for the dead and French mainland for the survivors, these warriors of faith defeated and tore down the false gods of syndicalism that the communards had believed in. Our Beloved Leader was not present as his situation has not improved and doctors are now contacting ministers to ask for their help in locating any old medical records that may be left to pinpoint the cause of his prolonged illness.

Ordinary people regarded the Colonel as a statesman of the world who gave confidence and respectability to France, a man who ensured that other statesmen listened to him when he spoke. Radio Paris announced his death and telegrams were sent to every corner of the empire. Several major French cities witnessed protests both in favor of and against his death. Some people celebrated it while others held rallies and prayed for him. Apparently, a poet has said, "The sky has fallen upon us, and this greatness will never again be realized by the French nation. It is as if the Colonel was a star that one can only try to emulate, but never become.".

It was not uncommon for him to have arrogance because he was intellectually sharp and came from an illustrious family. He was certainly not a coward, even if he were a bully. Despite the horrors of the last few months, his bearing and demeanor were noble. Negative circumstances would not break his spirit, nor would he budge or beg for anything. In spite of the fall of the mainland to the godless Syndicalists, the Colonel never lost hope and kept fighting for the French people, never kowtowing to the traitors.

Our first choice is Charles Vallin, a career politician who advocates moderation in the reforms proposed by De La Rocque. He prefers to slowly reform France and favors an open and free democracy with few restrictions. François Mitterand, on the other hand, is a radical and advocates for a radical upheaval in the political system to change the face of the French nation overnight. A third and more interesting choice would be François Coty, a Bonapartist who prefers a republican model instead of a monarchist model. He is a perfume dealer whose name is known throughout the Empire as a man of wealth and grandeur. Now the Council has convened for the first time after the tragedy of the previous month.

natfra.272.t:0 "President Vallin announce Reforms"
natfra.272.d:0 "As France’s new president, Charles Vallin has announced reforms to the political apparatus, liberalizing the regime with a more moderate outlook on party ideology. Even with these reforms, he has reiterated that many of the policies from the Colonel’s time will continue forward, further supporting his viewpoint that these reforms were necessary, but any further reforms are unnecessary and will make someone a dissident. Although the will of the people is to be considered, it does not have any effect on the final decision as it does not have the same weight as the word of the president. We may achieve a much more restrictive political climate by reverting these reforms if the need arises. As the nation of France enters a new age under their new president, Charles Vallin, these reforms will allow the people to flourish and allow the pious and god-fearing French to stand proud on the world stage."
natfra.272.a:0 "Much needed changes for the French Nation"

natfra.273.t:0 "President Vallin reaffirms CDF Position"
natfra.273.d:0 "Upon taking office, Charles Vallin reinforced the party ideology and announced nominal reforms that will help ensure the policies from the Colonel's era are carried on and help stabilize the nation. Despite vehement opposition from the leftist elements who survived the fall of the commune, Vallin has not modified the party's view on political reform and plans to declare such a group as a traitor to the Republic if it attempts to disrupt the status quo and cause instability. Christianity and democracy are the two main components of the CFD and to sacrifice either is a betrayal of what the Colonel fought for. In the opinion of the president, the path forward lies in following our traditions and culture, and not in sacrificing these important aspects of French identity in order to appease a few radical groups."
natfra.273.a:0 "Strength through our traditions will carry us forward"

natfra.274.t:0 "President Vallin visits Scouts"
natfra.274.d:0 "To see how the National Christian Youth Association is doing with its efforts to remake the French Youth as representatives of CFD party policy, Charles Vallin visited its headquarters. It had organized youth into groups led by captains to reform society into something De La Rocque had only imagined. He went to the different groups and questioned random members about their views on the current party policies before extolling the virtues of De La Rocque who saved France from the godless traitors of the Commune who deceived the French nation and were only concerned with enriching themselves, not caring about the peasants or the laborers who died so that they could live in luxury. After speaking to the youth, Charles called on them to support him in his mission to defend France and De La Rocque's vision for a Christian, strong France from traitors."

natfra.275.t:0 "L'État Présidentiel"
natfra.275.d:0 "The France of today is radically different from the France of even two years ago. The France of Today is a strong nation, full of vitality and purpose. Led by the strengthened office of the President there is no bickering, no protests and no dissension. All of France marches in lock step behind their valued and beloved President. Some still mourn the Parliamentary system of old but few actively wish to return to it. Instead our views, once thought too radical to work, have proven themselves."

While other so called democracies only deign to care when they are up for reelection our state does everything it does for the good of the people. The people may not even realize it, but they live now in the greatest, most free and most democratic state to ever exist on Planet Earth."

natfra.277.t:0 "La France aux Français"
natfra.277.d:0 "Today President Mitterand gave a speech during a rally in Bordeaux warning of an ongoing 'invasion métèque' or invasion of foreigners. However, he points out that this invasion is not by an army or by a state, but by a people. Those people, whoever they are, who flood over French borders, snap up French jobs for pennies on the dollar and rob good and wholesome Frenchman of the prosperity they so rightfully deserve. He warned the people that these foreigners are not Frenchmen and some, like those from far off places like Indochina or Japan, are barely people at all! He swore, then and there, to end this invasion and to restore the sovereignty of France by solidifying the border. His speech was so impassioned, and the language so fiery, that the crowd went wild. After it ended it spilled into the street and it took nearly two days before the riot could be quelled. That of course was not before the city's burgeoning Foreign Quarter had been severely damaged by fire and several people were killed. International outrage was immediate and severe but within France, the people cheered and shouted..."

natfra.278.d:0 "Today President Mitterand has met with leaders and students of the Jeunesse Etudiante Chretienne and spoke long about his ties to the organization. He praised their mission to evangelize and educate the youth and used that praise as a bridge to talk at length about something, according to advisors, he had been focusing more and more on over the past few weeks, the future. The students felt honored as their President praised them as the Future of France and the JEC leaders felt proud being showered in honors by their beloved leader."
natfra.278.a:0 "The youth is the basis of our nation."

natfra.279.t:0 "A Necessary Reorganization"
natfra.279.d:0 "President Mitterand has realized that the Croix de Feux has a new problem. Most of its higher up members are gray hairs, old men from the First Weltkrieg or even older who, in their old age, have grown sedentary and complacent. Meanwhile the party membership has trended younger and younger and these youth activists have proven to be even more active than the leaders were in their youth. To keep the CdF from stagnating and crumbling Mitterand has identified some particularly idealistic, active and talented faces from this new crop and has raised them up to the offices most needing reform. This of course has forced a low scale purge of elder members but, with the President as strong as he is, there was little fanfare."
natfra.279.a:0 "New faces for the CDF."

natfra.280.t:0 "President Coty Submits the CDF to his Will"
natfra.280.d:0 "Today in a shocking speech President Coty has declared that as President his job is to act as a vessel for the people’s will. The Party should act as the arbiter of his will and follow his order without dissent. The Party has received this direction with varying degrees of skepticism. Some say this simply Coty flexing his muscles for his own gratification. Others say this is a blatant power grab by Coty to bring the CdF totally under his control. They even speak in hushed tones about opposition to him. However these discussions are just that, discussions as every member of the Party knows that there is no real way to counter him."
natfra.280.a:0 "France will only achieve greatness by following President Coty."

natfra.281.t:0 "A New Kind of Bonapartism"
natfra.281.d:0 "President Coty has taken the Presidency in a radical new direction. Rather than act as an out and out dictator as many expected, Coty has adopted what he has termed “Republican Bonapartism”. This has, through his actions, been defined as a strong and charasmatic leader who fends off the elites' autocracy and does so while keeping a close relationship directly with his constituents, going around the rungs below him. This has made him much beloved by the French people and much despised by the autocrats he opposes. However, with his power and popularity, there is little that can be done about it."
natfra.281.a:0 "Napoléon would be proud."

natfra.282.t:0 "The Best French Perfumes"
natfra.282.d:0 "In recent weeks Frenchmen and women have begun to realize that their favorite radio and TV programs have begun to extol the gorgeous scents of Coty Inc’s perfumes and nearly every newspaper from the tabloids to the financial reports speak highly of the company. To the average person this may just seem like an unrelated ad push by the company that just so happened to have once been owned by the President. However, little do they know that Coty is very much behind the recent ad blitz. Despite popular assumption he never gave up his controlling stake in the company he founded and now, with France marching to his tune, he has decided that France should smell like he wants it to as well. He has begun to lean on media moguls across the country to push his products hard and so far it has already shown dividends. Coty products are flying off the shelves and, according to predictions his company will soon close out its most profitable year in its history."
natfra.282.a:0 "François Coty is really gifted!"

natfra.283.t:0 "Au Revoir Maréchal"
natfra.283.d:0 "The Metropole is ours and the wrongs of history have once more been righted. As all true Frenchmen and women celebrate, The Marechal Philippe Petain, helmsman of the French state for these past years has announced his retirement. After serving the French state faithfully for most of his life and leading it through thick and thin he has decided that France no longer needs his leadership. Nobody objects since If anybody has earned a peaceful life it is him. As the government begins to organize a new election Pierre Marcilhacy, Head of the Senate, shall head a caretaker government. As Petain walks into the history books France now can look forwards to a new and brighter future, completely free of the chains of the past."
natfra.283.a:0 "We will never forget the Lion of Verdun, a true French hero!"

natfra.284.t:0 "Presidential Election"
natfra.284.d:0 "Today the citizens of France went to the ballot box for the first time in years to elect a President. This will be the first President to lead all of the French metropole since 1920 and as such whoever is chosen will be of much significance. Even though the Presidential office itself is largely ceremonial, whoever wins will serve as a barometer for the intentions of this new France. On the electoral stage, among a smattering of small-time opponents, lie five frontrunners.\n\n There is Louis Napoléon, great-grandson of Jerome Bonaparte, Victor Emmanuel II, and Leopold I, and more importantly, great-grandnephew of Napoléon Bonaparte. While having repeatedly sworn up and down he has no political loyalties other than to that of France, many suspect him of bearing the Imperial ambitions of his forefathers. A war hero in his own right however, he served with distinction in the invasion of the Metropole, so his election is not out of the question.\n\n Secondly there is Ferdinand Bouisson, a moderate left wing politician who has sworn to uphold the plight of the common man. Despite having been cleared of Syndicalist sympathies by numerous investigations, his lower class appeal has drawn many disaffected former Communards back into the fold and their support may just catapult him to the Presidency. Thirdly there is Albert Chatelet. Through his rabidly anti-Communard speeches he has drawn a support base mainly from military veterans and reactionaries. His election to the Presidency would be unexpected and could inflame simmering tensions that remain in the Metropole.\n\nFourth there André Mallarmé, who is a relatively minor figure. Mallarmé is supported by the PR; his background as the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones and Minister of National Education guarantee him to be a strong and competent candidate who would aid in pushing the Parti Radical's liberal agenda.\n\nIn Fifth place stands René Coty, a moderate conservative, he is a perfect compromise candidate between the AD and the FR, he is also very popular with the rural population thanks to his pro-agrarians leanings\n\nIn Sixth place, there is the Monarchist and famed Historian Jacques Bainville, as an AF member and leader he is the only non-republican candidate\n\nFinally there is Pierre-Étienne Flandin, a Liberal Conservative firebrand and party leader of the Alliance Démocratique; he stands as a moderate candidate of the center, a safe choice away from the radical Bouisson and Chatelet, and far more experienced in political matters than the young veteran Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte."
natfra.284.a:0 "Emblazoned with prestige, Louis-Napoléon wins the election!"
natfra.284.b:0 "With the support of the Republicans-Socialistes and the former communards, Fernand Bouisson wins the presidency!"
natfra.284.c:0 "With the help of the right and the army veterans, Albert Chatelet wins over his opponents!"

natfra.285.d:0 "Today the President has been inaugurated in the center of Paris and was open to the public. While security was tight and both regular army units and MP’s were stationed in the crowd and in surrounding buildings to ward off Syndicalist terrorists, the ceremony went off without incident. In attendance, along with thousands of onlookers, was the current temporary Prime Minister Louis Marin who arrived with Marechal Petain himself, dressed in his full military uniform. It was the first time Petain had been seen at a government function since his retirement so his appearance electrified the crowd. After taking an oath to protect the French nation, people and Constitution the President gave a speech. The speech was rather good, all things considered. After he was done, the newly inaugurated President thanked Petain for his support of the democratic system, and swore to uphold the ideals of those who fell in the defense of France. The crowd went wild and were it not for the almost gratuitous security would probably have devolved into a riot. Instead the cheering of 'Vive la Republique!' and 'Vive la France!' reverberated well into the night."
natfra.285.a:0 "A true unifying factor for all French people!"

natfra.286.t:0 "The Legislative Elections That Will Determine the Future of France"
natfra.286.d:0 "Today the elections for the first Legislature to convene since the Liberation have been held.  Being as the Legislature will truly steer the ship of state for the future, the importance of this election was lost on nobody and as such turnout has been estimated to be as high as 90%. The political reshuffling after the Liberation has largely died down and by now five major parties are jockeying for seats. There is the Federation Republicaine, a center right Conservative party made up of Republican Orleanists. Though not as right wing as the AF or the CdF, it has been drifting further to the right as time has gone on leading some to worry about its future. There is also the staunchly centrist Alliance Democratique whose broad support from moderate left and right wingers has made for a frankenstein’s monster of a party adopting leftist ideals like the defense of freedom and promotion of reform and right wing ideals like a veneration of law and order and and opposition to collectivism and statism. However its broad appeal has made it equally broadly popular. Slight to the left of the AD is the Parti Radical, a staunchly secular, liberal and parliamentary Party. It once enjoyed a position as a dominant political force before the Weltkrieg. The left wing of the party supported the Revolution and this alienated the liberal middle and upper class voters the party has traditionally relied on. However, it has rebounded to some degree and now stands on the edge of a comeback. To the far right is the Croix-de-Feu, a rabidly nationalist paramilitary turned political party. Founded during the Exile by disenfranchised former veterans, they have been used by the government from time to time to break up native and/or Syndicalist rallies during the Exile. This has backfired however as it has given them a drop of legitimacy that their leader De La Rocque has turned into a river of support. Last and certainly least is the Action Francaise, an integralist and monarchist organization who advocates for everything the Republic is supposedly against. The AF wants to establish an anti-Parliamentary, hereditary, reactionary, integralist, decentralized and Catholic monarchy in a Parliamentary, liberal, centralized democracy. Despite the AF’s undoubtable influence among France’s many right wing Catholics; Few expect them to do anything close to well, yet even getting one seat could spell the eventual doom of the Republic so much blood was spent to save."

natfra.287.d:0 "Today marks the start of a new era in French politics, the start of a new Republic. It's no secret recently appointed Prime Minister de la Rocque had a grand view for how the country should be run. However, as Prime Minister his actions were limited. However it seems that de la Rocque was able to overcome that weakness. Recently the Croix de Feur, de la Rocques militia turned political juggernaut, has carried out massive demonstrations in major cities across France. Meanwhile de la Rocque has been holding marathon meetings with important power brokers in the Chamber of Deputies and the President. All of this in pursuit of the passing of a new Constitution giving the President increased powers. After hours of knock down, drag out negotiations de la Roque was able to brownbeat his enemies into compliance. The new Constitution was railroaded through the legislature during the next session and the President, feeling he had no choice, quickly approved it. However, de la Rocque was apparently not done since he was not the President. To remove him from power de la Rocque turned to old-fashioned intimidation, reportedly threatening the President’s family with violence if he didn’t resign. All of the President’s protests were waved away and, wishing to not see his family killed, he immediately tendered his resignation. The following Presidential election was basically only a formality. The people, pushing a wave of CdF popularity, swept de la Rocque into power as the new President, the first one of the new Fourth Republic."

nfa.310.d.noreconquest: "His Majesty Jean III, By the Grace of God, Most Christian King of France has passed away peacefully at 65 years old, in his palace of Algiers. Until his last breath, our King had been eager to serve his country and his nation in the place that was his, a country that he loved with unconditional love, the love of a father, for France and for the French, considering each as his children. Having served in the Great War, since his rise as head of the French Capetians he worked tirelessly to propose an alternative to the failing republic and after Maurras’s fateful call to restore the monarchy, to implement the deep reform needed to truly restore the Kingdom of France. But the burden of his increased responsibilities proved too much to bear for the monarch, already deeply affected by the defeat and the exile, and his health had been on a steady decline for some time. The dauphin had stepped in to relieve his father but this wasn’t sufficient, and those in the know knew that the passing of the King was only a matter of time. Part of Jean III’s dream to see his kingdom restored had come true, and with his family attending to him in his last moments, particularly his son the dauphin and his grandson Henri, he knew that the future was assured, that he was leaving the kingdom in good hands, that France would soon be freed, that all the sacrifices endured by his people and by himself had not been in vain, that, at last, he could rest.\n\nA week of national mourning has been decreed, at the end of which King Jean will be buried. Jean, departed from this world and now close to God, is succeeded by his eldest son, Henri, 32 years old. The energetic young man has been particularly active in working first towards the restoration in cooperation with the Action Française, then since his father’s coronation in the matters of state. These last few years, bustling with political activity, have made sure the young prince is more than ready as a statesman, as a shrewd politician, and as King to further his father’s dream.\n\nThe King is dead, long live the King!"

Popular festivities lasted late into the night, and this morning, two things are clear: the continuity of the monarchy is now well assured, and our nation must now be more determined than ever to free our countrymen from the red shackles of the Commune, so that one day the kings of France may be crowned in Reims once again."

Unlike his father’s coronation, the ceremony could follow as closely as possible the rituals established over a millennium by the monarchy. After swearing the traditional oaths and being anointed with oil from the Holy Ampulla, the prince was dressed in the regalia of the kings of France, including some thought lost in the exile like the hand of justice and the sceptre of Charles VI, before finally being crowned by the archbishop of Reims. Peers of the reborn kingdom and indigenous chiefs swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said.\n\nOutside the cathedral, though there were cheers and cries of 'Long live the King' along with jeers and insults, the crowd seemed mostly perplexed by this surreal sight: after all, it had been more than a century since a king was last crowned in Reims, and two decades under the Commune had certainly made it seem impossible that such an event would happen again. And so, instead of heading back to the residence of the archbishops of Reims for a private reception, His Majesty chose to head out of the cathedral on foot accompanied by his young son, mingling for some time with his new subjects, almost to prove to the reconquered nation, and perhaps to himself, that this was all indeed real: the red beast was slain, the kingdom was well and truly reborn, this war pitting brothers against brothers was over. Henri VI then delivered a speech radio transmitted throughout France and her empire, assuring that with his coronation, a new era has dawned, an era of order, peace and prosperity, and that all the sacrifices France had endured will not be in vain. While in some areas popular celebrations lasted well into the night, in others riots broke out: the King will have to prove himself to much of our nation."

nfa.60.d:0 "Following our successful landing on the mainland, hundreds of volunteers have arrived to our forward posts. The Armée De Terre headquarters decided to organise our local supporters into an irregular force named Milice Française (French Militia). This popular movement was quite unexpected but welcome, and we can expect more militias to arise as we liberate more regions of the Métropole. With help from the people, ousting the red scum from our beloved France will be much easier!"
nfa.60.a:0 "We're going to Paris!"

nfa.61.t:0 "Traitors!"
nfa.61.d:0 "Since the return of the reactionaries to France, all kinds of anti-syndicalist scum started crawling out of their holes. Deserters, criminals, terrorists and other lapdogs of the International Bourgeoisie offered their services to the illegitimate government in Algiers! We will have to be careful or the same type of events will happen in every region the Nationalists cross."
nfa.61.a:0 "It matters not! Death to the oppressors AND their lackeys!"

nfa.62.t:0 "France supports us!"
nfa.62.d:0 "The French government in Algiers has decided to support us in the ongoing civil war. It is possible that it is mainly because they hope to gain our support in retaking France back."
nfa.62.a:0 "Great!"

nfa.63.t:0 "France supports us!"
nfa.63.d:0 "The French government in Algiers has decided to support our cause in the civil war. It is possible that it is only due to their Catholic roots but also because they hope to gain our support in retaking France."
nfa.63.a:0 "Great!"

nfa.64.t:0 "CNT in Africa"
nfa.64.d:0 "With the CNT-FAI revolution in Spain and their gaining control over the African colonies of Spain, they have a foothold here. We chose to invade these territories to secure them from the red threat now we face a choice, what shall we do with it?"
nfa.64.a:0 "Occupy those territories."
nfa.64.b:0 "Give them to the Carlists."

nfa.65.t:0 "Conflict in Africa"
nfa.65.d:0 "The Nationalist French Government has marched on our territories in Africa! How should we respond to this action?"
nfa.65.a:0 "Let them take them."
nfa.65.b:0 "To war!"
nfa.65.c:0 "Offer what resistance we can....."

nfa.66.t:0 "Conflict in Africa"
nfa.66.d:0 "National French forces have taken our African provinces and surrendered them to the Carlist cause. What course of action should we pursue?"
nfa.66.a:0 "Let them take them."
nfa.66.b:0 "To war!"
nfa.66.c:0 "Offer what resistance we can....."

nfa.87.t:0 "Resistance to our Homecoming"
nfa.87.d:0 "Contrary to the popular support which made militias arise spontaneously, it seems the Communard government has managed to convince some of the poor people of France. A few Communard supporters are committed to hinder our efforts at reclaiming the Métropole to save the syndicalist regime. Already they are hard at work sabotaging our infrastructure, raising dissent and organizing a resistance."
nfa.87.a:0 "We must win over their support"

nfa.88.a:0 "Hidden Event"

nfa.110.t:0 "France Prepares to Attack us"
nfa.110.d:0 "Our spies in Corsica and Algiers have reported buildups of troops posturing for an attack against our nation. Their most likely avenue of attack will come from the south in Provence but we must keep our men flexible. Who knows what devilish plans the reactionaries have concocted during their exile. The revolutionary flame must never be extinguished by those traitors in Algiers!"
nfa.110.a:0 "They won't make it past the beach!"

nfa.111.t:0 "French Invasion of Morocco"
nfa.111.d:0 "The jackals of the French Government-in-Exile based in Algiers have sensed our weakness and decided to seize our colony of Morocco! There's not much that we can do... Some of our generals, however, believe that we should put up some resistance, even if just a token effort. A few nationalist field marshals are more extreme: if we are to still be respected as a great power, we must warn the French to move back or face our forces!"
nfa.111.a:0 "There's nothing that we can do, surrender the colony."
nfa.111.b:0 "Offer what resistance we can..."
nfa.111.c:0 "We may be weak, but we'll bow to no French - Resist any incursion."

nfa.112.t:0 "Morocco is Ours!"
nfa.112.d:0 "The falling German Empire has bowed to our demands and ceded the colony of Morocco to us. However, some rogue units refused to follow the orders of the Kaiser himself and are ready to resist the new French administration."
nfa.112.a:0 "Hm, that's weird."

nfa.113.t:0 "Morocco is Ours!"
nfa.113.d.moroccogermanpuppet:0 "The falling German Empire has bowed to our demands and ceded the colony of Morocco to us! Our troops are now entering the protectorate to set up a new French administration. It is a victory!"
nfa.113.d.moroccoindependent:0 "The spineless Moroccans have, rightfully, bowed to our demands and have ceded their lands to us. Our troops are now entering the country, now a French protectorate for the second time. It is a victory!"
nfa.113.a:0 "Great!"

nfa.114.t:0 "The German Warning"
nfa.114.d:0 "It seems the German giant is not as dead as it seems... After receiving our demands for the surrender of Morocco, the remnants of the Reich's government have ordered their troops to resist any French incursions into their colony, while also warning our cabinet to either cease the march into Morocco, or face German forces..."
nfa.114.a:0 "Maybe we shouldn't mess with them... Retreat!"
nfa.114.b:0 "Ignore their threats, advance into Morocco."

nfa.115.t:0 "Our Threats Have Been Ignored"
nfa.115.d:0 "The Algiers government has decided to ignore our warnings and their forces have already crossed the border into German Morocco. What shall we do now?"
nfa.115.a:0 "There's nothing that we can do, surrender the colony."
nfa.115.b:0 "Offer what resistance we can..."
nfa.115.c:0 "They made their choice - War!"

nfa.116.t:0 "French Invasion of Morocco!"
nfa.116.d:0 "Following the collapse of the once great German Empire, and our newfound independence, the French in Africa have taken it upon themselves to demand control over our territory, or risk facing war. What do we say?"
nfa.116.a:0 "We have no choice but to surrender..."
nfa.116.b:0 "We shall fight to the end!"

nfa.117.t:0 "The Moroccans have Resisted!"
nfa.117.d:0 "Foolishly, it seems as though the Moroccans have decided to snub our demands and will not be letting us enter the Kingdom. This is an insult to France, and must surely be dealt with at once. The Morroccans will be punished for their mistake."
nfa.117.a:0 "Unfortunately, we are not yet ready for war..."
nfa.117.b:0 "It is time to attack!"

nfa.155.t:0 "Joining the legitimate French government"
nfa.155.d:0 "Our recent liberation from our oppressive overlord raises the question of the goal of the existence of our country. Started as a satellite in an occupied France, we now have full power over our land but not much use for it. Near us lies the National government of France that descends from the legitimate government of the Third Republic and claims ownership of our controlled territory. A lot of our citizens also look forward to this other government and do not understand why we are making a satellite state last. Should we join with National France or should we declare ourselves a legitimate authority in the region?"
nfa.155.a:0 "Ask National France for an union of our states."
nfa.155.b:0 "We are the only legitimate power in France."

nfa.156.t:0 "The French meet the French"
nfa.156.d:0 "The former French puppet government in Paris has been recently liberated and, following a new foreign policy, decided to consider us the rightful French government and ask for a union of our authorities. We are obviously very happy to hear that and hope Frenchmen will continue rallying together."
nfa.156.a:0 "Hurrah!"

nfa.401.t:0 "The White Fathers" #Jan 1936 and then one every month and a half
nfa.401.d:0 "Critical to the stability of the regime, the Society of the Missionaries of Africa is a Catholic society of apostolic life focusing on evangelism and education in Africa. Founded in 1868 in Algiers, they quickly became an integral part of colonial society, adapting to native customs, adopting the native dress, all the while accomplishing a tremendous amount of ethnographical and geographic research. They have been on the forefront of French initiatives on the continent, despite their sometimes strained relationship with an increasingly anticlerical republican government. They have become staunch advocates for the native populations, even accepting native priests, never hesitating to side with them against the colonial authorities when needed and generally acting as a bridge between the two, earning them the affectionate nickname of \"White Fathers\".\n\nIn the troubled times since the revolution, they have become downright crucial to maintaining French authority over what is left of the empire, working tirelessly to maintain the peace between colonists, exiles, and natives with the full support of the Marshal’s conservative government."
nfa.401.a:0 "Our Lady of Africa, pray for us and the Muslims!"

nfa.402.t:0 "Action Algérienne"
nfa.402.d:0 "Founded in the ’20s by Ferhat Abbas in the chaos of the exile, calling itself the principal media outlet of integral nationalism alongside the main Action Française, Action Algérienne has become one of the most popular newspapers within the Algerian departments. Its slogan, \"From Colony to Province\", summarises its fight alongside integralist principles: assimilation within a greater France, while still retaining privileges, traditions and local laws against the centralisation and disregard for indigenous customs of the Republic. Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber Muslim population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the indigènes."
nfa.402.a:0 "Nationalists, united against the Republic? Can’t be good."

nfa.403.t:0 "Jacques Bainville"
nfa.403.d:0 "Jacques Bainville, born in 1879, renowned historian, journalist, and one of the founders of the Action Française, gave today a grand speech at an AF meeting in Algiers. Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled \"The Political Consequences of Peace\", Bainvillle exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among exiles, and Bainville’s speech was listened to by thousands of Action Algérienne members, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending this grand event. The Lion of Verdun himself put out a statement honouring the speech and works of the historian now seen as a prophet by many."
nfa.403.a:0 "Un grand homme!"

nfa.404.t:0 "Immaculée-Conception de Ouagadougou"
nfa.404.d:0 "The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Ouagadougou was consecrated today in the presence of [NFA.GetLeader], Governor of Haute-Volta Henri-Louis Joseph Chessé, and Joanny Thévenoud, the very influential apostolic vicar of the city of Ouagadougou, whom some whisper is the \"true governor\" of the colony. The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture. It stands as a powerful symbol of the success of missionary work within the French colonial empire and especially that of the Pères Blancs. It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thénévoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thénévoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed. However, the apostolic vicar has always dismissed claims that true power in Haute-Volta lies with him, presenting himself as nothing more than a humble missionary blessed with some success, caring for his flock."
nfa.404.a:0 "A living saint, that Thénévoud!"

nfa.405.t: "Mother's Day"
nfa.405.d: "Ten years ago, the government instituted a heavy-handed natalist policy, which among many other measures included the creation of a special celebration for Mothers’ Day, and of a Medal of the French Family, awarded to good mothers of numerous families. Though the results of these policies are only just starting to be felt, Mothers’ Day has caught on as a truly popular celebration, is now widely celebrated in schools and homes across the nation to the delight of mothers everywhere, and it has become customary for children to bring home little gifts for their mothers, and for husbands to make sure this is a special day for wives and of course for their own mothers. In a speech broadcast on the radio today, [NFA.GetLeader] reminded women that \"Only you can give to future generations the taste for honest work, this sense of discipline, of modesty, of respect which makes healthy men and a strong nation. You are the source of our Christian civilization, and our greatest hope for the future\", ensuring that the incredibly important role of women in society is reminded to all and given the respect it deserves."
nfa.405.a: "Bonne fête Maman!"

nfa.406.t: "Humanisme Intégral"
nfa.406.d: "\"Integral Humanism. Temporal and spiritual problems of a new Christianity\", the recently published work of influential Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain has caused passionate debate among Catholics. A convert from Protestantism, once close to the Action Française despite not being a monarchist, mostly out of suspicion towards representative democracy and opposition to the anticlerical policies of the Third Republic, Maritain has drifted after the shock of the exile towards more moderate positions, closer to the personalist movement and Christian democracy. Rejecting both reaction and liberalism, secularism and intransigent political Catholicism, embracing humanism, arguing for human rights, the importance of family, pluralistic democracy and responsibility toward the common good, all in the spirit of the social teachings of the Church, the philosopher is somewhat going against the grain. Indeed, much of the French Catholic laity and hierarchy has been radicalised by the current situation: the AF has even denounced \"Integral Humanism\" as the work of a traitor, a sell-out to \"democratism\", a red saboteur. However among more progressive Catholics Maritain’s work was very well received, getting praise from Father Montini, a close advisor of the pope, and with some moderates even being drawn away from the Action Française, heeding his warning that the movement is merely using the Faith as a tool to further their political ideology."
nfa.406.a: "A new kind of integralism, huh?"

nfa.407.t:0 "The Call of Silence"
nfa.407.d:0 "The Grand Prix du cinéma français has been awarded to \"The Call of Silence\", a drama by Léon Poirier. The movie, retelling the life of Blessed Charles de Foucauld, had found critical acclaim and great commercial success: indeed, he has fascinated the French public for years now. Charles Eugène, viscount de Foucauld would have seemed for much of his early life an unlikely candidate for the devotion now surrounding him. Born into an aristocratic family, he lived a dissolute life, eventually becoming a cavalry officer. This experience spurred him to leave his old life behind: he decided to take the vows, attracted by an ascetic life of poverty among the Tuaregs with whom he formed deep bonds, learning their language, translating the Scriptures, and preaching through example. Seen as a saintly man by natives, authorities and the Church’s hierarchy, a tragic end awaited him: caught in the conflict with the Senussi, he was martyred on the 1st of December 1916.\n\nDesert hermit, saintly martyr, pioneer of French influence in the most remote corners of the empire, Father Charles became a national icon, his total abandonment to God and asceticism inspiring many Catholics, leading some to rethink their positions on native populations and Islam as a whole. His recent beatification has even led the Academy of Colonial Sciences to petition the papacy so that he be made patron saint of colonisation: the regime, however, hasn’t waited for him to be officially recognised as such, and prominently uses him as a propaganda piece, despite de Foucauld’s frequent criticism of colonial attitudes."
nfa.407.a:0 "\"Father, I surrender to you\": a saint for sure!"

nfa.409.t:0 "News from Corsica"
nfa.409.d:0 "This morning, a war memorial containing soil from the mainland was inaugurated on a beach near Ajaccio. It was dedicated to the tens of thousands of Corsicans who gave their lives for France during the Weltkrieg and subsequent civil war. Since the revolution, the island has been an incredibly important bastion for us: indeed, it is so close to the Commune that its shores can be seen on a clear day, while Red Italy is not far away, either. As such it has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and air base from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the mainland, with tense face-offs with Internationale ships occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of exiles landed, and though most moved on to Algeria, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that paired with the military build-up has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms. Though there is no longer a stream of refugees like in the early days of the Commune, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero’s welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul \"the Emperor\" Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the métropole. The authorities, however, turn a blind eye to this, as the mafia has proved to be an incredibly useful network of informants within the Commune, all the while attending to the baser needs of infantrymen and officers alike."
nfa.409.a:0 "What a lovely island!"

nfa.410.t:0 "Louis Blériot Dies"
nfa.410.d:0 "Louis Blériot, born in 1872, engineer, inventor and pioneer of French aviation has died of cardiac arrest in his Algiers villa at only 64 years old. Fascinated with the idea of flying and inspired by the prototypes of French engineer Clément Ader and the successes of the Wright brothers, Blériot put the profits of his automobile parts business towards the creation of flying machines. First encountering so many failures that the press derisively nicknamed him the \"King of Crashing\", he eventually achieved worldwide fame and recognition for being the first to cross the Channel in an aeroplane in 1909, in only 37 minutes. A living legend of aviation, even being attributed to the first pilot’s license, he created a successful firm building his ever-improving designs. With the Great War, he specialised in light reconnaissance planes, his company producing eventually more than ten thousand planes for the French army. At the outbreak of the revolution, Blériot fled to Algeria like so many others and successfully re-implemented his business, Blériot Aéronautique, the Marshal encouraging research and development in any field with any potential to help the coming war effort, eventually running as a candidate for the Parti Radical.\n\nFollowing his death, the government has put out a statement honouring his contribution to the field of aviation and to the war effort, as well as his resilience facing his early setback, calling him an example to all Frenchmen in these difficult times. The creation of a Louis Blériot medal, to be awarded to record setters in speed, altitude or distance in light aircraft, was also announced."
nfa.410.a:0 "Long live the \"roi de la casse\"!"

nfa.411.t:0 "Murder Rocks the Casbah"
nfa.411.d:0 "As he was on his way to the Sidi Ramadan mosque, the great mufti of Algiers, Mahmoud Bendali, was surrounded by two men and stabbed in the heart, dying on the spot. The two perpetrators were caught after a quick investigation and confessed to the murder, justifying their actions by saying the mufti had acted against the Islamic faith and was little more than a puppet of the infidels. Appointed by the colonial authorities first as imam then as a mufti, unpopular and frequently brazenly critical of even mild reformist talk, Bendali had many powerful enemies. After a rough interrogation session, the murderer confessed to being merely a pawn in a greater scheme, offered thousands of francs to kill the imam by the true mastermind behind the crime: a prominent member of the reformist Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, Tayeb el-Okbi. Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the state under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many Algerians and some Frenchmen believe this is a conspiracy, and that el-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment. We could drop charges against el-Okbi, somewhat losing face but preventing any further unrest and possibly gaining an ally within the Association, or we could keep him in jail, getting rid of a prominent indigène leader and sowing dissent among the ulemas."
nfa.411.a:0 "Free him, clearly the murderer was just trying to shift the blame!"
nfa.411.b:0 "We can’t let him roam free."

nfa.412.t:0 "A Legionnaire"
nfa.412.d:0 "The latest movie starring comedic superstar Fernandel, \"A Legionnaire\", has been, like almost everything the actor touches, a success. A master of physical comedy and slapstick, adding to it a talent for singing, his movies generally featuring a few humorous songs that then prove to be successes in their own right, he has often been compared to American actor Charlie Chaplin. This time the actor plays Fernand, a hen-pecked husband who, after getting knocked out, wakes up in a caravan heading towards the Algerian interior, his identity papers stolen and replaced by new ones: he is now another man, a new volunteer in the French Foreign Legion. Incapable of explaining his situation to his officer, Fernand is called to fight some unruly tribe deep in the Sahara desert, and despite early mishaps, he quickly finds military life much more enjoyable than his marriage, and especially much less disciplined. Now truly a whole new man, he is eventually tracked down by his wife but instead chooses to re-enlist under his real name, becoming a veritable hero and eventually being awarded the Legion of honour.The humorous tale has proven particularly popular among veterans."
nfa.412.a:0 "Fernandel did it again!"

nfa.413.t:0 "Journal d’un Curé de Campagne"
nfa.413.d:0 "Today, the Grand Prize of the Académie Française, one of the oldest and most prestigious literary awards in France, has been awarded to Georges Bernanos for his novel entitled the \"Diary of a Country Priest\", published earlier this year, finding great critical and commercial success. Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners, sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering \"All is Grace\".\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticizing clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this \"Diary\", a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."

nfa.414.t:0 "Second Bureau"
nfa.414.d:0 "A new movie has taken French cinemas by storm: \"Deuxième Bureau\", directed by Pierre Billon. After numerous production delays and a harsh reception by critics, the commercial success of this thrilling tale of espionage is a surprise. Telling the story of captain Benoit, played by Jean Murat, sent on a mission by the Second Bureau, our elusive military intelligence agency, to seize the blueprints of the latest red weapon in the very heart of the Commune, this movie has it all: action, suspense, and of course, romance. Of course, the handsome captain is eventually noticed by Communard counter-intelligence, who sends their best agent after him: Elise, true femme fatale, tasked with seducing the agent. Of course the two fall in love, and plan on escaping together: as the Communards realise this, she sacrifices herself and dies in her lover’s arms, forcefully reminded of his duty to France.\n\nCritics hated it, calling it cheap entertainment, and yet, the public loved it, and asked for more, dismissing rumours that the film received state funding to transform the public image of the secretive and sometimes sinister agency as mere Communard propaganda."
nfa.414.a:0 "Could this be the start of a series?"

nfa.415.t:0 "The Archangel Disappears"
nfa.415.d:0 "Jean Mermoz, nicknamed the Archangel, is a veteran pilot who turned to airmail transport after the war, becoming a pioneer in the field and accumulating countless feats of adventure, such as surviving a crash in the Sahara and captivity in the hands of rebel Tuaregs, becoming the first to cross the South Atlantic from Senegal to Brazil and then the first to cross the Andes by plane. His exploits are told like epic tales in newspapers and newsreels, and he has become something of a national hero, even getting involved in politics with Colonel de La Rocque’s CdF and advocating for the development of air travel. But a few days ago, on his twenty-fifth cross-Atlantic flight the aviator disappeared. Circumstances are still unclear and the fate of Mermoz is still unknown, with headlines reading \"The Disappearance of the Archangel\", and articles sounding more and more like eulogies with each new edition. The whole nation awaits with bated breath any news from the Atlantic."
nfa.415.a:0 "He survived worse, right?"

nfa.416.t:0 "Miracle in the South Atlantic"
nfa.416.d:0 "After more than a week without news from Jean Mermoz and the crew of his Latécoère 300 Croix-du-Sud However, little hope was left for their safe return home. However, today, a miracle happened: Mermoz and his exhausted, sunburned, thirsty but very much alive crew were found drifting in the ocean by a Brazilian ship. The news, just like the pilot, quickly crossed the South Atlantic and spread like wildfire, cinemas and theatres even interrupting their programming to inform the audience. Public relief is palpable, the government has put out an official statement thanking the Brazilian authorities and a hero’s welcome is already being planned for the Archangel."
nfa.416.a:0 "Every failure survived, gives us strength to succeed next time"

nfa.417.t:0 "Pépé le Moko"
nfa.417.d:0 "\"Pépé le Moko\", a melodrama starring rising actor Jean Gabin and the already famous Mireille Balin has quickly found great success at home and even abroad. Set in Algiers, particularly in the labyrinthic and exotic old town, the Casbah, the movie tells the story of Pépé, played by Gabin, a former big shot in the Parisian underworld now in hiding, and the men trying to catch him, both law enforcement and syndicalist agents looking to put down once and for all a major organizer of the black market within the Commune. Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, played by Balin, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to \"slum it\" among natives and emigrants in the sensual and dangerous world of the Casbah. The two strike up a relationship, igniting the jealousy of Pépé’s mistress. This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it’s hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic. And Pépé, quintessential anti-hero, criminal but principled, has become a bit of a youth icon as many identify with his situation at the crossroad of two worlds, French and native, as well as with his melancholic longing for Paris."

Already coffee houses all over the colonies are ordering crates after crates of the sugary drink, a boom sure to stimulate the agricultural sector, the climate of Algeria being perfectly suited to cultivate citrus fruits."

nfa.419.d:0 "In 1935, a scouting troop for Muslim boys was created by Mohamed Bouras, supported by reformists ulemas, traditional elites, and reform-minded Frenchmen, all hoping that scouting would promote physical and moral education, character building, a sense of responsibility, as well as duty to Allah and the motherland. Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, a sense of belonging, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell’s books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys around seven years old, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford. However, these groups have remained largely isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts that would permit greater cooperation and uniformisation of scouting practices among the indigènes. Already, prominent native voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along with loyalty to France, while some more conservative pieds-noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the patrie they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria. More pragmatic voices in government argue that giving our approval to this federation would grant us much greater oversight over a largely autonomous initiative."

Composed by a Hungarian exile in the Commune in 1935, the song made its way across the world, first becoming a mainstay of seedy concert halls and cabarets before reaching mainstream audiences when it was first recorded in French by the popular singer Damia. In these trying times, it’s hardly surprising that the peoples of Europe and beyond are prone to melancholy, however, rumours have been circulating about the song: that it is linked with an ever-increasing number of suicides, in France, the United States, and the composer’s homeland, Hungary, and that merely listening to the tune could push even the cheeriest individual towards suicidal ideation. Whether this is a fact, a mere urban rumour, or a clever marketing campaign, the song has already been banned from airing on the radio or even being sung publicly in more than a few countries, which only adds to the credibility of rumours about the now-infamous \"Hungarian suicide song\".\n\nHere too, a debate has raged on the question of a potential ban, an almost welcome break from the usual political fracas.

Founded in 1930 by Maxime Real del Sarte, an artist close to the Action Française, after the man organised for a relic of the saint to be smuggled out of the Commune, the association describes itself as apolitical, simply stating that it seeks to \"bring together all those of goodwill around she who saved France in her hour of need and who so perfectly embodies our aspirations for the freedom of our nation\". And indeed each year the patriotic celebrations organised around the shrine built for the relic are more and more popular, with tens of thousands in attendance for a day culminating in an open-air mass, including numerous parliamentarians, officials, bishops, intellectuals, veterans, and officers, and this year even [NFA.GetLeader] himself.\n\nHowever despite the association claiming that it seeks to remain apolitical, and the \"Pucelle\" being revered by most of the political spectrum, many seek to use the event to further their political agenda. Both the Action Française and the Parti Social Français have repeatedly been caught distributing leaflets, supporters of the two parties sometimes even coming to blows. However, these minor incidents have not hampered the general enthusiasm for the celebrations, and the Companions expect even more attendance next year."

nfa.422.d:0 "\"To the Spanish Martyrs\" is a poem by dramatist and diplomat Paul Claudel, a deeply conservative, devout Catholic, a long-time critic of the anticlerical Third Republic, who became a sort of official poet of the Petain regime, his long religious plays earning him unending praise and even a Nobel prize nomination. However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of red terror, profanations, and acts of syndicalist violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil. Committees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, \"Aux Martyrs Espagnols\" calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs: it has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."

Slowly, indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become an incredibly popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club’s goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."

nfa.424.d:0 "\"The Grand Illusion\", a war film featuring an all-star cast, is quickly becoming the most successful and controversial movie of the last few years. Set in a German prison camp during the Great War, the movie follows three French officers, one of working-class background, an aristocrat, and a nouveau riche naturalised Polish Jew and their efforts to escape captivity. Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the war is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling a wide variety of themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the war ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House. In any case, it has become an instant classic."

Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution brewing in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat’s hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of \"Soldier-Prince\" and a promotion to the rank of general. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco’s national day falling on the Prince’s patron saint’s feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France’s political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince’s palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."

Born in a royalist family but rallied to the Republic, he turned down the opportunity of a military career and instead dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting the integration of physical activity in education. But de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and for them to become an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Panhellenic games, and the first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics couldn’t prevent the madness of the Great War, and following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Already heartbroken by the death at the front of two nephews, the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics, that neither Frances attended, and the subsequent establishment of the Spartakiades, left de Coubertin a broken shell of a man, his dream crumbling before his eyes. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."

Viticulture in a region that is populated in the vast majority by alcohol-abstinent Muslims might seem peculiar, but Algeria is well suited for growing grapes, with it’s warm, sunny climate. Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony. Since the exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the métropole."

In this essay, the heir traces back the origins of the poor working and living conditions of the proletariat to the Revolution of 1789, a \"bourgeois coup\" that he claims turned the proud artisans and farmers of old into proletarians by destroying traditional structures such as guilds and enabling economic liberalism. He chronicles the slow descent into indignity of the working classes over the last century and a half, caused by usurious industrial capitalism and new illegitimate elites, culminating in the 1919 revolution, an event that he considers engineered by nefarious forces exploiting the legitimate grievances of the masses. Prince Henri then makes a passionate case for the monarchy, the only regime he claims could truly restore the dignity of the people by upholding tradition and the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThe work was well-received and sold well, thanks to tireless promotion by the Action Française and praise by influential clergy, already being translated in multiple languages and published abroad, though some were shocked by the violence of Henri’s denunciation of capitalism and the bourgeoisie.

Much of its collections are recent acquisitions: indeed, the government-funded extensive ethnographic expeditions in our present and former colonial possessions in an effort to consolidate our hold on outlying territories. The 1931 Dakar-Djibouti Mission alone, for example, made up of linguists, ethnographers, naturalists, painters, photographers and even a musicologist, brought back more than 3000 objects, 6000 photographs, 1600 meters of photographic film, and 1500 pages of notes documenting invaluable information on a rapidly disappearing way of life.\n\nThough there has been criticism over the manner of acquisition of its collections, some radical newspapers even going as far as making accusations of racket, the opening ceremony of the museum was a success, attended by the mayor of Algiers, the minister of the colonies and thousands of curious Algérois, pieds-noirs and indigènes alike."

But it is the ending that has most divided the opinion, as the crazed man who had vowed to end all wars, temporarily relapses into sanity to find that the world is getting ready for a new great conflict. He springs into action, and in a supernatural storm calls on the millions of dead of the Weltkrieg, regardless of their nationality, to rise from their grave and punish the living for their foolish obsession with mutual destruction. All over Europe, the dead of all countries hear his call, unite and march on, creating mass panic and preventing another war.\n\nAccused of pacifism, of sullying the memory of our war heroes by some, praised for his skill by others, Gance escaped censorship due to his links with veterans associations: indeed, many veterans were employed during the filming of the movie, and in particular many \"gueules-cassées\", broken faces, for the great finale.

Tenacious, quick, and with incredible precision, some see in him immense potential, despite his one real weakness: fragile hands, earning him his other nickname, \"The Man with Clay Hands\".\n\nBorn in a poor pieds-noirs family of Spanish origins, speaking French, Arabic, and Spanish, having left school at 11, drifting from job to job until his father realised his true worth as a boxer, Marcel’s success story has turned him into a popular icon. No matter the community, Arabs, immigrants, pieds-noirs, exiles, the public sees him as a true self-made man, coming from nothing and yet climbing ever higher through sheer effort and strength of character. His national title well earned, he is now looking into joining the European fray: the whole nation will follow with great interest his career from now on, cheering him on, perhaps even all the way to a world champion title."

Though still small, the community hopes to attract more members seeking a life of work, prayer, and service to the natives, with whom relations have so far been peaceful.\n\nFar from being the only monastic community in a similar situation, Catholic media and hierarchy have nonetheless praised this latest example of religious coexistence, while others see the abbey as a shining example of the civilising mission of France in her colonies. However, some have expressed worry: the community is far from the centres of colonial life and most importantly their garrisons.

Born during the Weltkrieg to a failed singer and a street acrobat, raised in a brothel for most of her childhood in the torment of revolution, she was nonetheless blessed with an incredible voice, her harsh life has given her a haunting depth and sensibility. Having started her career as a street singer, she quickly started performing in cabarets and workers’ clubs, singing about working-class life and struggles. Soon, she was on the radio, and inevitably her songs would cross the sea and the embargo. Her records are played in the packed clubs of Algiers, as Frenchmen let the nostalgia of their homeland be soothed by Piaf’s striking Parisian accent and tales of the atmosphere of the shady parts of the City of Lights.\n\nSome find her songs scandalous, while others insist these songs are coated in syndicalist propaganda, but the government is doing nothing to stop the spread of her records and it is rumoured that she has admirers in high places. Amusingly, she has proved equally controversial in the Commune: there, she has been accused of encouraging bourgeois degeneracy and singing counter-revolutionary propaganda about the living conditions of the proletariat, though thankfully these complaints fall on equally deaf ears."

By the author’s admission, however, the plot of the book is largely there to serve its historical and ethnographic qualities. Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation \"to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser\", proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from “civilized” people and that they too have a long and rich history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself Dahomean. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing a generally pro-French sentiment but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction. This decision which could have proved controversial has instead been generally met with praise from much of colonial society, though for varying reasons: where some évolués see proof, if one was ever needed, of the intellectual equality of the Black man, some in the colonial government see proof of the success of the civilising mission."

Their relationship is cordial and polite enough, though understandably chilly due to geopolitical considerations, but a fight breaking out between sailors of the different crews prevents any further fraternisation. However, an incident brings them together: arms traffickers are spotted leaving the harbour, and in their flight have released poison gas. The deadly cloud is slowly drifting towards a passenger ship, and the men put aside their differences to save the civilians, going straight through the gas with little protection: the civilians are rescued and the traffickers stopped. Despite their heroism, all the crews lose some men, including the Red British officer, and they are all buried with full military honours.\n\nDirected by the profoundly Catholic director Léo Joannon, filmed at sea with the help of our navy, on real ships and with real sailors as extras, the movie was hit with criticism from some who found distasteful the positive image of the German and British characters, going as far as taxing the movie of pacifism.

nfa.472.d:0 "One of the more controversial aspects of the Action Française is the continued relationship of some of its members with Occultism. For many reactionary Catholics this relationship is evidence enough that they are not truly committed to the Counter-Revolutionary cause. In Algeria this relationship has deepened even further. Under the influence of characters like René Guénon, and his newspaper La Gnose, and the desire to fight an esoteric spiritual war against the Syndicalist some have flocked to the Masonic Orders, despite the deeply anti-Masonic rhetoric of the new integralist monarchy. Furthermore, with Guénon's conversion to Sufism many of these Masons and other types are increasingly interested in the native Sufi Tariqas or Orders. With the AF now in power, this relationship is increasingly troubling, with some proclaiming it the return of Gnosticism and Quietism, both of which are excommunicated heresies. The Tariqas themselves are also worrying because of their rumoured links to Algerian independentist groups.\n\nIt’s become clear that some sort of repression is in order, what should be done?"

nfa.473.d:0 "After the defeat of Napoléon the Third in the Franco-Prussian War there was an explosion in esoteric societies in France. This occultist milieu produced various New Religious and Philosophical Currents claiming ancient lineages and hidden knowledge, supposedly handed down by cabals of Masons, Magicians and Alchemists. From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental Religions and Metaphysical Systems. However, following the defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-Materialist tracts and published "The Crisis of the Modern World" in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, “Oriental Metaphysics” is a detailed exploration of Oriental Metaphysical Systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the Liberal worldview of their recent past in favour of a Traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences. Calls for a ban of the book have arisen from clergy and conservative Catholics, while others argue that it could be helpful in evangelisation, or control, of the natives."

nfa.500.d:0 "'En Terre d’Islam', a monthly academic magazine dedicated to Islamic studies, has enjoyed a well-deserved success even among relatively mainstream audience, at least for this kind of publication. Our current exile has led many, particularly academics and clergymen, to seek a better understanding of the faith of so many of our countrymen. Some out of genuine interest or hope of interfaith dialogue, while others dream of large-scale conversion of the indigènes to Christianity. A recent open letter published anonymously in “En Terre d’Islam” is threatening the fragile religious equilibrium, however. The letter, calling for the formation of a “Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims” to “pray for our estranged brothers” was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Moroccan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to “study the enemy”, but a year later he would convert, and join the Fransciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."

From a stage adorned in banners featuring the party-cult’s symbols, the phoenix, a wheel and thunder, he leads the ever growing crowds in repetitive chants, such as:\n\n'Through our Fire, She will be reborn\nHer Faith will be perpetual\nHer Genius will shine\nFrance will be Eternal'.\n\nSince the man’s political platform seemingly does not go into more depth than these charismatic if deranged rants, nothing was done at first by the authorities. As the crowds grew however, a cursory investigation was initiated by our intelligence services. Shockingly, they found that this “François-Henry Prométhée” has never existed, and is merely the pseudonym of Maurice Delaunay, a farmer from Normandy, who after brilliant studies at the National Institute for Horticulture and a brief stint in politics has seemingly lost his mind.

Something had to be done to prevent red propaganda being directly broadcasted to our people in that way, and this year was finally created a Tour d’Algérie. Going through most major towns of the Algerian littoral, such as Orléanville, Oran, Bone, starting and ending in Algier, with even a detour through Tunisia, the race was a massive popular success, giving bicycle racing fans the euphoria of a national sporting competitions they had seeked for close to two decades by now.

A strange sight for the officer in charge of processing his application, more used to foreign men of dubious pasts, willing to serve and die for France for a chance at a new life. He gave Henri Robert Orliac as his name, and the officer did not care if that was the truth. Like so many others in these bellicose days, Orliac was then integrated in the troop, once in a simple recruit uniform only somewhat standing out from his peers.\nTruth is, Henri was not an ordinary recruit: his real name is Henri d'Orléans, royal prince of the House of France. In the Great War, his father too had attempted to join the Foreign Legion but was denied from it due the Law of Exile barring representatives of the former reigning houses from setting foot in France. But young Henri, eager to serve France in this great crusade against socialism, could not be deterred from doing his duty.

Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois. \nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto. All clad in their green-trimmed formal attire, complete with personalised ornate swords and bicornes, the 473 members of the Institute have signed a common appeal to the world to undermine the efforts of these 'perverts' and 'bohemians', and penned a manifesto in which they call for the creation of a international 'Institute of Occident' to fight the 'vanguard of inculture'. This initiative has received wide acclaim in France and among our Entente allies, as well as from the German sphere. \nAs for the International Avant-Garde, it responded by setting up an abstract statue representing 'bourgeois culture' and 'classicism' made out of copies of the manifesto in front of the former location of the Institut de France, in Paris. As the inauguration ceremony was underway, it was set ablaze by known lunatic Georges Bataille, a move that was applauded as an example of 'pure artistic spontaneity' by the organisation."

The left would insist that this is a day celebrating the 1789 storming of the Bastille fortress, a Parisian royal prison and armory, widely considered as the starting point of the French Revolution, while the right would on the contrary consider that this is a day commemorating the Fête de la Fédération, a massive holiday festival that took place across France a year later to celebrate the unity of the French nation, and an end of the political struggle, of the Revolution itself. History proved that hope wrong, but this hasn’t stopped this debate from arising every year. The 1880 law instituting the National Day on the 14th of July simply abstains from taking a side, but thankfully we have since put the controversy to rest, as an amendment voted by the Assembly some years ago has clarified that we are indeed commemorating the Festival of the Federation today."

nfa.507.d:0 "The 'Association des oulémas musulmans algériens' or Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema is a religious association founded in 1933. Under the unofficial leadership of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, this association of theologians, teachers and more generally learned men has come to promote Islamic reform, hoping to bring Islam in Algeria to its pure original form, away from the superstitions fostered by the marabouts and the more mystical approach of the Sufi congregations. Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, skeptical of both the sincerity of the AF’s promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Communards."

The ceremony was carefully organised to follow as closely as possible the millennium old protocol, despite taking place in the Saint-Philippe cathedral of Algiers instead of the traditional coronation in Reims, which current circumstances would make difficult to organise. Much of the necessary ceremonial items, like the sword Joyeuse, said to have been the sword of Charlemagne, as well as the Holy Ampulla, glass vial holding anointing oil said to have been given by the Holy Spirit for the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, had been evacuated during the retreat from the mainland and new regalia was crafted by skilled artisans, particularly an ornate crown.\n\nAfter swearing oaths on the Scriptures to defend the Church, maintain peace, fight injustice, be merciful and just, as well as fight heresy, Jean d’Orléans was anointed in nine spots in the shape of a cross with holy oil by the archbishop of Algiers, then was draped in a blue cloak sprinkled with gold fleurs-de-lys, given the scepter and the hand of justice, and, finally, crowned. Peers of the reborn kingdom swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said. This done, the king and the royal family headed out for their new residence, the former presidential palace in the heights of Algiers, cheered on the whole way there by a numerous crowd, public celebrations and banquets taking place well into the late hours of the night. Some important details were altered in the ceremony, however: the king did not swear the traditional oath to fight infidels and was instead given by the mufti of Algiers a traditional flyssa sword representing his new status of Hāmī al-Islām or Protector of Islam, and among the peers swearing fidelity to His Majesty were numerous Arab, Berber or African chiefs in their traditional costumes, symbol of a new era of French rule."

nfa.513.t:0 "Women's Suffrage"
nfa.513.d:0 "The issue of women’s suffrage has been a contentious one in French politics for a long while. At the revolution, women were considered “passive citizens”, a category shared with children and domestics: in other words citizens who were inherently under the influence of another and as such could not be trusted with the right to vote. In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality. Idem when a Third Republic was declared in 1870. Though they were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women’s suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women’s suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband’s will, or worse,\n the Church’s.Charles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."

But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d’Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armored: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."

The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regnum Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place.

The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centers of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the “City of Bridges”. As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the pieds-noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of independentist talk."

We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favorable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, behemothic patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar es Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé von Göring as head of the chimeric \"Deutsch-Mittelafrika\", the overambitious Flying Ogre only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered. We will bide our time, observing and contacting our former native allies: perhaps sooner rather than later they will come back under our influence."

nfa.523.d:0 "Surrounded by his female guards the Mino, better known to Westerners as the Amazons, clad in his finest traditional attire and wielding his “récade”, the axe-shaped royal scepter, the elderly King of Dahomey welcomed in his palace of Abomey our envoy, who lavished him with gifts, praise, and with one demand: to reestablish the treaty of friendship and commerce that had united our two nations since 1894. The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly reestablish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources. But this is a joyous day: French diplomacy has secured us the first step towards the reconquest of our African empire."

Taken over and restored after the conquest of Algeria, the fort was until recently a secondary garrison. However the sleepy citadel has been bustling with activity for the last few months: a school was created there by the regime to educate the future elites of the nation.\n\nUnder the leadership of Lieutenant Pierre Dunoyer de Segonzac, a young and fiery officer, and René de Naurois, a military chaplain beloved by his men, the National School of Cadres of Oran has created an innovative six-months curriculum to shape hundreds of the brightest youths of the nation into leaders worthy of serving France. With strict discipline, exemplary morality, strenuous physical exercise inspired by scoutism and military training, long hours of study and a deep sense of camaraderie, Lieutenant Dunoyer de Segonzac hopes to create a New Man entirely dedicated to national interests. Interestingly the students in their retreat between sea and sky have begun to shape the “spirit” of the School themselves: nicknaming Dunoyer de Segonzac “Old Chief”, though the man is barely thirty, they have styled themselves as a knightly order, with a motto and coat of arms, swearing an oath to France and their comrades. A development embraced by the direction of the School as the romantic image of the school brings ever more volunteers.\n\nHowever, Sainte-Croix’s independence is worrying some within government while others consider the school to be slowly but surely into a personality cult around the “Old Chief”, if not a cult plain and simple given the increasingly mystical Catholic devotion fostered by Padre de Naurois.

In the sillage of our victorious armies some dared to join our forces’ open air masses, priests who had gone into hiding reclaimed their parishes, while some still skittish, perhaps fearing a red counter-offensive, only discreetly brought flowers to the few roadside shrines which had managed to escape the purge of religious expression from public space. With the fratricide conflict coming to an end, the once silenced bells rang all over the nation, great  processions were organised to purify towns and villages from the stain left by both atheistic anticlericalism and the orgy of violence, crosses were put back up, long lines formed at the confessional, pews filled up, pilgrimage sites teemed with life as survivors came to bring their thanks to whichever saint they prayed to for protection in battle or as bombs fell indiscriminately: Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, of Lourdes, of La Salette, Saint Thérèse, Saint Geneviève, Saint Jeanne d’Arc, all had their new devotees. \n\nThe Communards had attempted to stamp out the 'opium of the people': clearly, this was not as successful as they had hoped.

Truth is, they didn’t need any explanation: a simple picture was sufficient, a picture that would be in every newspaper the very next day.\n\nWith a total area of 200 cm2, described as 'small and devastating', named after the now infamous Red project for an atom bomb by the genius inventor who hoped it would create an “explosive commercial and cultural reaction”, the damocles, now the world’s smallest swimsuit, is creating of wave of passion across Europe and beyond. Réard has already received thousands of fan letters, strangely enough mainly from men, and just as many orders, but many are not amused by this new fashion statement.

However, with a lack of funds allocated for the conservation of the Palace of the Popes under Communard rule and some sizable damage occurred during the reconquest, the city has seen better days. \n\nAs such, to gather funds for the reconstruction of the medieval quarter, the city with support from the government has created a week-long art festival, focused primarily on theater, the palace making for a prestigious open-air stage. Expecting the visit of a few locals, the city was instead overwhelmed by the attendance: thousands showed up to see plays such as Shakespeare’s “Richard II” or “The Story of Tobit and Sarah”, a biblical tale by devout Catholic diplomat and poet Paul Claudel.

The Tour’s precise itinerary was different every year, and having the event pass through one’s town or village was certainly the event of the summer. The revolution did not hamper the enthusiasm of France for the Tour, though the number of foreign participants starkly dropped. Indeed, cycle sports were even encouraged by the Communard authorities as a proletarian alternative to motorsports, much like football was promoted over rugby. Even in exile, our people listened intently to the Tour on the radio, leading to the creation of a rival Tour d’Algérie which did find much success, though it never stopped our people from illegally tuning in to red radio stations to follow the competition.\n\nWith the mainland reconquered however, it is time to organise once again the Tour de France, hopefully bringing, if only briefly, our still deeply divided people together. However, within the committee tasked with determining the itinerary a question arose: should this Tour also pass through Algeria? After all, the Algerian departments are a part of France like any other. Medical experts have warned that this would turn the competition into an almost two-months long affair and that the sweltering heat of the Maghrebi summers could make more than one cyclist collapse, but the symbolic triumph of a unified tour could certainly make this risk worth it."

Many of our Catholic citizens believe that the churches should be rebuilt as they were, a way to exorcise the godless past, however this would have a certain cost, especially when the money could be redirected to more urgent causes. Alternatively, we can rebuild some of them while giving them another purpose, like housing concert venues or public libraries.

However, one heap of slowly rusting metal is turning into a playground for local children and attracting the curiosity of a few onlookers: a disabled heavy British tank in particularly good shape, once a lynchpin of the local Syndicalist defense, stuck in a ditch right outside Vimoutiers. \n\nOf course, the authorities attempted to seize the tank as part of the country-wide effort to heal the scars of the war, either to scrap it for parts and metal or study it further. But the Vimonastériens refused, even chasing away one cleanup crew: children cried at the thought of losing their playground, while the adults had grown strangely attached to the wreck. Of course the near pristine state of the tank has spurned numerous jokes about the bravery of the British troops but mostly the locals seem fascinated by the object, its newfound peaceful quietness perhaps a symbol of the slow return to normalcy across France.

Following the fall of the Eternal City, these volunteers immediately headed to France to fight bravely in the Franco-Prussian War. These devout Catholics, many of them royalists, headed by Baron Athanase de Charette de La Contrie, descendant of a famous leader of the Vendée insurrection, nevertheless set aside their differences with the Republic to fight against the Prussian aggressor. Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading “Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France” was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit.

It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honor, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty.

Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies. \n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany.

Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu’min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfill this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire. \n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."

Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest  has taken to the radio to call for an “insurrection of Goodness”. Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised “Emmaüs” welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national preeminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shockwave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and “Abbé Henri” as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of a Emmaüs charity network are already underway.

With the victory of the revolutionary forces, the song became immortal. Incredibly popular, the song is undeniably a republican symbol. However the fate of \"La Marseillaise\" is sowing dissension even among our partisans.\n\nMany have no issue with the song, including Maurras himself, much like few have issues with the Tricolore: it has accompanied Frenchmen in some of the most glorious moments of the last century and its lyrics could easily be understood as more broadly patriotic than republican. On the other hand, a minority desires a total rejection of anything brought by the revolution, arguing that we could not fight one revolution while the embers of the previous one still burn. As such they demand the reintroduction of the anthem instated following the fall of the impostor Buonaparte, \"Le Retour des Princes Français à Paris\", based on the melody of the popular song \"Vive le roi Henri\". A compromise was also proposed: the armies of the counter-revolution had themselves adopted a modified version of the song, called \"La Marseillaise des Blancs\", the \"Marseillaise of the Whites\", with radically different lyrics, which could satisfy everyone: after all it would be a shame to waste such a stirring melody."

In 1927 however, following renewed economic turmoil and national humiliation inflicted in Africa by the Germans, a coup was engineered by Lusitanian Integralists, men inspired by Maurras and the Action Française, and a new government set out to restore Tradition and Faith in the small nation and its globe-spanning empire. Portugal had become a living experiment, a showcase of the possibility of the true counter-revolution. Portuguese implementation of the Integralist dream was followed intently by the Action Française, each development praised in dithyrambic articles, each setback explained as the work of red agitators and other saboteurs.\n\nWith France following in Portugal’s footsteps, this state visit is seen by Lusitanian Integralists as a crowning success, proof of their prescience, and by many Portuguese as a source of national pride. The Dauphin toured the many sights of Lisbon and her surroundings accompanied by King Duarte II, before travelling to the small village of Fátima, in a pilgrimage to the site where the Virgin Mary appeared to tens of thousands. The princes and their close entourage then retired to Pena Palace for some well-deserved rest. It seems the two young men bonded over their shared experience and a budding friendship was born. And if court gossip is to be believed, something more might unite the two soon: young King Duarte was apparently struck by the beauty of Henri’s sister-in-law, Brazilian princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Bragança, accompanying her sister Isabelle on this diplomatic tour. Regardless of these auspicious personal bonds being forged however, one unbreakable now unites our two nations."

Outnumbered and initially suffering heavy casualties, the royal army prevailed thanks to its iron will, winning for the King a decisive victory. One force in particular illustrated itself facing the British Coldstream Guards, sending the elite force in a frenzied retreat, even seizing their banner: the six regiments of the Irish Brigade. These brave exiled Jacobite Irishmen served France for generations, never letting go of their hope to see one day a free Ireland, fighting for our kings against the \"fheall na Sasanach\", the treachery of the British.\n\nTheir dreams have now come true: Ireland is free, and the \"Sasanach\" being our closest allies will not stop us from commemorating Irish blood shed for France and the unbreakable bond uniting our two nations. Royal representatives travelled to Dublin to participate in a ceremony honouring the Irish Brigade on the day of their triumph at Fontenoy, where a monument funded by the donations of French and Irish Integralists was unveiled and enthusiastic speeches, in approximate Irish on our part, approximate French on theirs, were warmly received by a large crowd. The ceremony over, intense discussion took place between representatives of the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe party and our envoys on a variety of topics, such as the translation of the works of Charles Maurras into the Irish language, our ongoing process of counter-revolution, as well as further funding for their movement that they claim will soon be a favourable position to seize power: looking positively starstruck, these determined young men assured us that Ireland will once again stand with France to help us achieve our dream of freeing our homeland, against both Communards and Boches."

Despite our best efforts they remain unreachable, as if they had vanished without a trace alongside their particularly important cargo.

Though the purchase of any goods from the mainland is officially banned and likewise the Commune has desperately tried to enforce an embargo against us, there exists a thriving black market controlled in large part by our assets, recruited from either ideological sympathisers or organised crime, with wine and cheese being especially sought after, as they are after all essential goods. Despite official praise for Algerian wine, you would be hard pressed to find a bureaucrat, a businessman or an officer who had ever tasted it, and even among the lower classes where to find a good bottle for special occasions is an open secret."

nfa.545.t: "Tu Parles d’une Ingénue"
nfa.545.d: "\"Tu Parles d’une Ingénue\", \"Call that an Ingenue?\", the first novel by Jean Bruce has been a surprise hit. The young man, born in the Commune after the revolution but a sympathiser of our cause, took inspiration from his involvement in our intelligence networks to write a spy novel which clearly fulfilled a niche for many Frenchmen who welcome some respite from the rather drab current situation. After such a success, possibly helped by a titillating cover and a dirt cheap price, a sequel has already been released and five more are already planned for the next year alone. They tell the thrilling stories of suave French operative Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, codename 2B 117, who travels around the world to fight bloodthirsty revolutionaries, all in between of what seems to be his main occupation: seducing and breaking the hearts of both high-class ladies and women of the night, of all allegiances, nationalities and creeds, these love affairs of course being described in torrid details. Here, the spy gets involved with Parisian organised crime to secure stolen documents of critical importance, there he stalks the red light district of Shanghai, looking for a turncoat, then we find him singing in a Cairo café or lost in the favelas of Rio: the novels have little artistic merit and will not win any literary prizes but this is of little concern to the author. Bruce is already a rich man and 2B 117 is the talk of young men all over France, who endlessly quote to each other the spy’s cheesy one liners."

nfa.471.d:0 "The colony of Haute-Volta, while effectively conquered in 1896, is still composed of traditional kingdoms with few official powers but with a powerful influence on the population. The biggest of these is the Mossi kingdom, headed by the current Moogo Naaba, Naba Koom II. It holds the legacy of the most powerful kingdom in the region before French colonization, which spread its power far beyond its capital of Ouagadougou to neighbouring kingdoms. However, other kingdoms such as Tenkodogo, Fada N'Gourma, Boussouma or Ouahigouya still exist along with their kings and continue to vie for influence in Haute-Volta. \nIn this context, a dispute recently arose between the Moogo Naaba and the other kingdoms. Indeed, Naba Koom II praised the work of the native ethnologist Antoine Dim Delobsom "The Empire of the Mogho-Naba" (L'empire du Mogho-Naba). The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies. However, the book also spreads a view of the country as being almost compelled to bow under the Moogo Naaba, feeding and legitimating the still very existent ambitions of Naba Koom II to make the Mossi kingdom the dominant power in Haute-Volta. This display of ambition didn't sit well with the other kings, wary of the Moogo Naaba playing between the interests of the French colonists and those of the population to assert the power of the Mossi once again. \nRepresentatives of each kingdom came in a delegation to the seat of the colonial governor in Ouagadougou to compel him to take a stand on the matter. Who should we support?"

Several sections of track were hammered out of alignment causing the train to derail and crash. While there were no deaths reported from the incident due to the first train passing being a relative skeleton crew manned cargo train, most of the cargo was still too damaged to make it to its destination.

A brief but intense exchange of gunfire between the rebels and other nearby units in the garrison ended with a victory for the French troops but the morale has hit a new low with the ease at which the rebels managed to gain entrance into the facility.

Raising an improvised flag over the ramparts, our men were chased out of town without their boots. After they had run for several kilometres, they encountered an armoured car patrol that they were able to flag down.

We of course quickly put him out at the time and forbade the CGTT, but it didn't stop it from existing underground. The union always was close to the Tunisian nationalists of the Destour party, and the two underground organisations often worked together in the past. This time, they worked to foment a strike amongst the Tunis dockers and in several factories in the south of Tunisia and in Tunis. \nIf syndicalist propaganda wasn't already threatening enough, the strikes have also put to the forefront a word of independence for Tunisia. An absurdity of course, but one these workers seem to believe in. In any way, it's going to be the time for a bit of cleaning in the dockers of the port of Tunis, and if the strikers won't disperse themselves, we will have to send the army."

These members of the nationalist Destour party aren't the most important ones - they aren't Habib Bourguiba or Abdelaziz Thaalbi - but most of them are suspected of treason. They come in and leave the palace discreetly and transporting nothing but there is no doubt the Bey is transmitting them important pieces of information. Moncef Bey is the son of one of the previous honorary monarch of the protectorate of Tunisia, Naceur Bey, and is the grand-nephew of the current ruling Bey, Ahmed II. He has always been remarked for his opposition to the French regime and he doesn't hide too much his likening for the Tunisian nationalists.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning considering Moncef is the next on the line of succession to the statute of Bey after Ahmed II. Whatever he is actually doing to help these terrorists, an opponent can't be tolerated this close to power. With our important military presence, an intervention to 'secure' the Bey shouldn't meet a lot of resistance."

After only 20 minutes the crowd, visibly getting larger by the minute, was already spreading to all of the small streets around the square accompanied by a tumultuous clamour. At the center of the gathering was a young Algerian militant. Even if only in his 20's, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observants were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Etoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land. \nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd. This incident can't be ignored, and can't be taken lightly. It is representative of the strategy of the ENA to spread its ideas and supplies to a talented younger generation of militants in Algeria for them to start the fight for independence in Africa with support from the French Commune. While their attempted struggle is far from being over, it isn't a reason to be lenient. We must take care to not let any comparable event happen again."

The details of the start of the fight are then unclear but all versions agree to say the street turned into utter chaos in a few minutes while members of the two parties fought, threw chairs, tables, and any projectile they could find all while insulting each other in French and Arabic. The fight finally stopped when rumours were heard of coming police.\n\nThis fight of a minor importance reveals the increasing tensions between the two main Algerian nationalist parties. The ENA is a syndicalist party, founded in Paris by Messali Hadj, forbidden in Algeria and radically opposed to the current French rule. The Action Algérienne however is legal and its leader, Fehrat Abbas believes in assimilation into Greater France and calls for a greater traditional autonomy. The Action Algérienne is based on the ideas of the Action Française, adapting integralism to an Algerian context.\n\nIn the end, whatever the actual differences are, the good news is that they all hate each other."

All of the books have been seized by the police, to not let them badly influence anyone again, and the two Algerians present at the time of the intervention were arrested for treason.\nFurther inquiry has established that the basement belonged to a young pied-noir living in the district and sympathetic to the nationalist cause, who was consequently arrested too. Those pieds-noirs betraying their own country are a real thorn in our feet, as they have to be judged by French law and defended accordingly. They can also use their privileges to easily build a web of pieds-noirs militants across cities and rent places like the one we just raided to organise.

Tensions are exceptionally low between the population and the colonial government. This is why the announcement of a miners' strike went as a shock for the colonial authorities. This morning, the workers of an iron mine refused to go to work and stayed in front of the mine. They claimed better conditions of life and better wages, taking the example of the richness of the colored bourgeoisie in Dakar to legitimize their claims. Fortunately for us, their strike wasn't followed in other mines of the country and, after a single day, the army was sent in to take care of the strikers. Let's hope this isolated incident stays... isolated."

nfa.469.d:0 "Senegal is very clearly our most economically dynamic colony in West Africa. The large port of Dakar is supplied with mining resources from the Senegalese countryside and with other goods coming from all of West Africa by railway. This rich export economy relies however on a deep divide between the merchant bourgeoisie in the cities, composed of Frenchmen but also of Black 'évolués' (evoluted) with the French citizenship, and a vast working class, the most visible example of it being the dockers of Dakar and the miners. In reality the lower classes mostly work under a regime of forced labour called by the colonial authorities, most notably to build infrastructure.\nThe Senegalese society is thus very stratified, and this is something the lower classes seem to be starting to realise. Murmurs of jealousy and questioning of the system have spread to the Senegalese working class. 'Why are the ones in Dakar so rich yet we struggle to live correctly?' \nIf Senegal is still far from being prone to revolt, a few strikes have already been put down in the last years and this situation needs to be kept to scrutiny."

nfa.470.d:0 "Our source about this issue is a French member of the colonial administration in Dakar, invited by friends to a mundane dinner in which rich French and Black 'évolués' (evoluted) merchants sat together. The administrator expected a friendly atmosphere, after all the 'évolués' have French citizenship and hold a lot of privileges compared to their black lower class counterparts, suffering under the Code de l'Indigénat. His surprise was thus big when he heard a group of 'évolués' talk about how Senegal could organise itself after independence. The discussion was unbelievable, the 'évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny anymore. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar... The lesson of the story anyway, is that some of the 'évolués' can unbelievably come back to bite the hand that fed them."

First he encouraged the locals to kill their cattle to prevent them from transforming into lions, panthers and vultures. Then he told them that they had to stop paying their taxes and throw away their French money. Finally, he announced that White people were leaving the country: the governor of the nearby city of Biltine had already been driven out by natives, and that it was their duty to kill all Whites left to be able to finally live free. To help them fulfill this mission from Allah, the dead would even come back to life and swarm the French garrisons. Not that they had anything to fear: according to the “prophet”, the guns of the Frenchmen now only fired water.\n\n Few were truly convinced, but the brewing resentment of the peoples of Chad only needed the tiniest spark: a small insurgency broke out under the leadership of the madman, a returning patrol was swarmed and massacred and soon the local garrison was under siege. Order was quickly restored and the madman publicly executed, but the whole strange affair is a warning: the situation far from Algiers is more than volatile."

The Tuaregs, having been driven off some of the usual roaming lands, had been made to sometimes live in more inhospitable regions. There, unable to rely on cattle farming like they usually do, they had to get more creative. This was the reason for their attack this morning on a Nigerien village, close from the desert but fertile enough to have farms and reserves. A small Tuareg force arrived at dawn to pillage the farms and steal the food reserves, but they didn't anticipate the presence of a small French patrol resting in the village. The French presence wasn't planned, and it only consisted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuaregs. A few shots made one of the horses fall, with a Tuareg tribesman falling on his head. Another Tuareg was shot in the belly, and a French soldier was gravely injured before the force fled and left the village. The French soldiers got to congratulate themselves before leaving to help their wounded friend, the village however had to rebuild on its own."

Our soldiers were suddenly attacked by a full Tuareg force armed and determined, they were hiding behind a relief waiting for the patrol to come closer before they charged with cavalry towards it. The first panicked shots of the patrol did make a few horses fall; however it soon was the French horses that started to fall as another group of Tuaregs hidden in the dunes started shooting from another angle. Completely helpless and surprised, soldiers fell left and right to the bullets and the blades of the Tuaregs before the survivors retreated disorderly. One of the survivors managed to get back to the nearest colonial outpost to tell this story.\n\nThe attack is an outrage but we are quite powerless to punish them unless we send a full blown army to search the desert. We will have to punish people nearer to us, who are probably Tuareg collaborators anyway..."

napfra.1.t:0 "Prowling for Parliamentary Allies"
napfra.1.d:0 "As the Petain administration searches for much needed support for the Bonaparte Restoration, he has begun to look for allies in his new quest. While he could surely do it by himself it would look better and go smoother if broader sections of the government supported the move as well. One of the most natural places to look for support is the Parliament. Petain is sure that the people will welcome their rightful ruler back with open arms and how better to know than by swaying their representatives? However, as Petain’s administration began to put out feelers they were surprised at the ice cold reception they got. Those few who listened to the arguments soundly rebuked them. Most of them cite the spectacular failures of the First Empire, the Hundred Days and Second Empire as their reasons, if they cite a reason at all. Even those few Bonapartists in the Assembly have expressed reluctance to support the move. They claim they didn't get into power on their Bonapartist principles and if they did come out in support of Napoleon, they could lose their next election. After weeks of fruitless searching, Petain has begun to give up hope on finding political allies."
napfra.1.a:0 "Merde"

napfra.2.t:0 "Fall in Line with the Army?"
napfra.2.d:0 "While the search in the political arena turned up fruitless, Petain has seemingly found a new way to gain support for Napoleon, the Army. Napoleon I gained power twice through the Army and Louis Napoleon is a respected soldier. If anybody would support a Soldier Emperor, it would be the Army right? Well, it turns out that Petain was again wrong. The officer corps have again stonewalled the feelers Petain set out and a few of them were even detained by MP’s for treason and had to be discreetly freed by Petain. They have seemingly decided to back the Republic they have sacrificed so much for, even if a better option is begging to be put in action. A search through the common soldier has turned out no better. Many common soldiers are too preoccupied with their duties as soldiers to be too ready to support such a radical change. Even those from Napoleon’s own unit are hesitant saying that while he is a good soldier, he seemingly has no qualifications to be a good Emperor. With yet another avenue closed, the search begins again."
napfra.2.a:0 "Who's Next?"

napfra.3.t:0 "Lockstep with the Legion?"
napfra.3.d:0 "Petain, having failed to gain the ear of the Parliament or the Army, has turned to extra-governmental organizations, militia as the layman would call them, for support. His first port of call was the Legion under Joseph Darnand. Darnand, encouragingly, at first seemed all too eager to help. However this initial optimism turned sour quickly when Darnand began making demands of the government. His demands of increased involvement of the Legion in government functions, integration of the Legion into the Army and exuberant powers to Darnand himself were too much for Petain. While Petain wanted Napoleon on the throne he also wanted Napoleon to be more than a puppet for the radicals. Petain tried to compromise, giving Darnand a position in government and making the Legion a government organization but separate from the Army, but Darnand refused to budge. If Petain wanted his help, he would have to serve France up to him on a silver platter. That was simply too much for Petain and talks collapsed. However intelligence indicates that Darnand has seemingly taken notice of our offer and might use it to his advantage somehow. In any case, for Petain it's back to page one...again."
napfra.3.a:0 "Another door closed"

napfra.4.t:0 "Action from the Action Francaise?"
napfra.4.d:0 "Now getting desperate Petain has turned to the Action Francaise, an ardently monarchist organization. However unfortunately for Petain the AF supported the Orleanist candidate for the throne and not Napoleon. When Petain came to ask them to support Napoleon, he was dismissed out of hand by Maurras . As Petain slinked back to his office, once again defeated he began to receive intelligence that a certain faction of the AF, angered at Maurras ’ failures, were prepared to support Napoleon. When the government secretly reached out to them to maybe work out a deal and possibly help them take over the organization however, government agents found their faction weak and disorganized. While maybe in the future they may be of some note, now they are of no use to anybody, much less Petain."
napfra.4.a:0 "Probably to be expected."

napfra.5.t:0 "A Deal with the Devil"
napfra.5.d:0 "With no other options, Petain has finally come to the radical Jeunesse Patriotes for help. As a Bonapartist militia they were easy to win over. While Petain winced at the thought of giving their leaders political offices and their gangs official status, he had no other options. Taittinger voiced some opposition over Napoleon’s democratic leanings but Petain assured him that he had explained to Napoleon that he would be unable to seriously affect government actions which has seemingly placated the JP. Already the JP are flexing their muscle over their rivals, using their protected status to settle old scores without interference from the police. However they do hold an outsized political influence and have also begun using it to the government’s benefit. Taittinger has begun a massive media blitz glamorizing the Bonapartes and has begun to win over the populace. This has even begun to filter to the top as the topic of the Grand Restoration has begun to be floated in the halls of power, as more than just a desperate act, due to this populist wave. If we are to use this to its greatest potential we must act fast, even if we are left with a sour taste in our mouth."
napfra.5.a:0 "We’ve won, but at what cost?"

napfra.6.t:0 "The Third Regin of Terror"
napfra.6.d:0 "”Pret! En joue! Feu!” was the call of the day as many ‘traitors’ were rounded up by JP militia and marched by the dozen into town squares across France. These traitors were then quickly lined up against any suitable wall and executed before another group were marched in to stand on their bodies and meet the same fate. This ‘Traitor Terror’ as its been called as whipped France into a paranoid frenzy. JP propaganda has convinced Frenchmen that treasonous snakes lurk behind every corner and hear anything of any use to filter it back to France's many enemies. This national paranoia has had a lot of personal consequences. Anybody showing any sort of suspicious behavior is likely to be lynched if not reported to the JP. Already the death toll has been thought to be in the tens of thousands and as France continues to circle the bloody drain, tearing itself apart from the inside, foreign experts worry the carnage is only just getting started. Curiously as most other political forces have been decimated a dozen times over and decapitated, the social-democratic Republican-Socialist Party remains markedly untouched. Some say this is for the fact that they are being protected by the Emperor, and it is true that Napoleon has personally helped some of his friends escape death, but the more likely answer is that they are simply too small to notice. For once political irrelevance seems to be a good thing."
napfra.6.a:0 "Terror is nothing more than justice; prompt, secure, inflexible."

napfra.7.t:0 "The Emperor of the People"
napfra.7.d:0 "Recently Napoleon, someone that many figured was little more than a puppet, has begun to assert his position. As JP militia continue to comb the countryside looking for anybody they deem to be not French enough to warrant life, increasingly Royal pardons have been dispatched to save these people’s lives. While some JP militia initially refused to acknowledge them they were soon told, as were all militia chapters, that Royal decrees of any kind were to be followed to the letter. Meanwhile Napoleon has begun to force carve outs for some of the more draconian laws instituted by the JP. This has begun to win him the love of the people and makes him now a threat to the government, his government. As more and more angry meetings are held about what to do with the now rogue Emperor Napoleon grows more and more assertive by the day. It now seems that the status quo that once seemed so rigid and inflexible is now bending to the breaking point and it's anybody’s guess when or how it would finally break."
napfra.7.a:0 "Is the 'Little Emperor' not so little after all?"

napfra.8.t:0 "A Long Night In Paris"
napfra.8.d:0 "The young Emperor has begun to grow acclimated to the splendor of Paris. Every night, he looks out from the windows from the Fontainebleau and sees the center of his empire. Youths engage in romance, small business owners are starting to open up shop, and the gentlemen are back to acting like they own the place. These months are the first he has himself freely experienced France, and it brings Louis Napoleon the greatest joy...and fear. He has tried to ignore the terror, the reaction, the aggression. It has been there his whole life, after all, from his days with the conservative and ageing Empress Eugenie to the cutthroat environment of Algeria. The Communards are gone, but the misery in the Metropole remains. The government perpetuates a structure of violence in his own name, what to do?\nThe most powerful man in France never felt so weak and lonely. Not even when no one would stand by him as a true friend and mentor in those first days of the Restoration... But then his thoughts drifted to hope, for the people. The people had always stood behind Napoleon. From the day of coronation, to his first time strolling the streets of Paris, the people always celebrated the Emperor and made him feel at home in his country, even as his officials trampled over them. Those thoughts were all he needed to resolve himself to do what had to be done. Finally, he remembered the words of his mother after the Liberation, urging him to be a ruler worthy of loyalty from the people...\n\nIt has been four hours since the Emperor summoned General Giraud to order an arrest of his own government. Though he begged and pleaded with his closest confidants to be with his people in the city to rally them to action, they would not budge. The Emperor was stuck listening and waiting from Fontainebleau. Even from a few miles away, he could hear the night. Gunfire, the ringing of bells, shouts of urgency. Louis Napoleon was a soldier, and here he was, alone. Something had to be done, it had been far too long since he heard any word.\nSomething had to be done, it had been far too long since he heard any word.\nClutching his pistol, His Majesty, accompanied by a few guards, defied the wishes of his advisors and began to head for the nearest radio broadcasting station, eager to rally the people against the tyranny of the Patriotes. As they came closer to the city edges, the night grew more quiet. Only the chiming of the new hour was heard, until another entourage, perhaps escaping, perhaps hunting for stragglers, emerged near the station. They approached the young Emperor and as the officer began to speak, Louis Napoleon began to weep tears of..."

napfra.9.t:0 "A New Emperor?"
napfra.9.d:0 "Treason! Treason of the highest order was just barely fought off recently! This treason drew from the Emperor himself no less! The Emperor had tried to lead a coup against his own government to destroy the best change France has in the future! He was a Crypto-German! A Freemason! No better than the Communards he claimed to hate so much. The JP had always been wary of Napoleon and his effete liberal leanings. However they were promised up and down, left and right that Napoleon would know his place. Now those promises lay broken just like the peace the JP had fought so long and so hard to enforce on the anarchic wastes of the Communard ravaged Metropole! All that energy and time wasted! However Napoleon is now gone one way or another and the JP realize that they can't really have an Empire without an Emperor...or can they?\n\nOne suggestion to replace Napoleon is to place in his stead another Bonaparte, a distant family relation, Joachim Napoleon Michel Murat, 6th Prince Murat. He is a rabid Germanophobe, having fought and suffered in the First Weltkrieg. He knows he will have no power and honestly has no real want for it. However he does support our cause, and even a toothless lion can be intimidating. The second option is to place Edouard Soulier in position as regent. He is our honorary President and as such can be counted on as politically reliable. Besides, he is a rather old man at 60 years old and will be unable or unwilling, more likely the latter, to oppose whatever actions we might take for the betterment of our country. Along with this, Soulier is himself a protestant minister, making him quite neutral. Thirdly is the simplest option. We can simply maintain the rule of the council until 'the nation is ready for an Emperor.' This would eliminate any possibility of a rambunctious executive from the mix and simplify things mightily. However, what is an Empire without an Emperor?"

That is why the Patriotes have called together a meeting of  other right wing clubs to hammer out an agreement to get them to support our rule. However only those that the previous government reached out too were able to trust us enough to answer the call. Those who ignored us will pay one of these days. In any case we must choose who to appeal most to. However the representatives have made it clear that they will only accept the government’s sole attention, meaning courting one will completely alienate the other."

napfra.11.d:0 "With the Jeunesse Patriotes out of power, the Emperor has called for new elections to form a new government. While the elections were open to just about anybody, save for radical Syndicalists, only two real parties have coalesced. There is the Parti Impérial-Socialiste-Démocrate, formally the Republican-Socialist Party, under Napoleon himself. Largely social democratic and progressive, it clings hard to its Emperor and his progressive and democratic platform due to his protection and shielding of them during the Exile. They say that the chaos of the past is just that, in the past and it's long past time France once more enjoys the fruits of true democracy once more. The second big party is a more right wing one under Francois Coty, former member of the largely defunct Croix de Feu. He has rallied a big tent coalition of rightists and Petainists who point out the recent coup as the danger of democracy. Coty and his Party urge for a strong and centralized state to keep a lid on the constant barely controlled chaos that democracy brings. They also point out that France has had three Republics before and every single one has failed."

napfra.12.t:0 "Fate of the Syndicats de Gauche"
napfra.12.d:0 "Since the end of the Second Commune there has been one last vestige of Syndicalist influence in France, the Unions. While a great many unions were purged of left wing taint, more than a few big unions like the teamsters and railway conductors especially remain saturated with Syndicalist agitators. With the chaos of the Reclamation and its aftermath, this state of affairs was, if not accepted, then at least tolerated. However, with things finally calming down on the homefront, the government has turned to these festering hives of subversion and is close to a decision on what to do with them. The simplest idea is to let them live. The Syndicalists have been discredited in the French psyche and only a small fraction of Union members are Syndicalists. However that may not always be the case, and the Revolution was borne from the striking Unions was it not? A second option is for the government to take control of the Unions. This will let the government carefully weed out the red taint and keep it out while also allowing the workers some say in how things are run, and keep them docile. However radicals say this won't go far enough and demand we simply crush the unions. They led to the death of France once they claim, we should not let them continue to hang over us like a bucket of water over an anthill."

This ‘Pink Bonapartism’ as its been termed is just as it seems. It still believes in the importance of an Emperor and the strengths of a centralized state, however it believes that these things are to be used to further the plight of the people. The Emperor has begun many government programs to help the poorest of Frenchmen and women, subsidized a scholarship program to boost college graduation rates for the poor and opened hundreds of soup kitchens across the country. Meanwhile the government has reinforced government assistance to those in need, furthered the arts and supported the reformations of unions. All of this has won the people over who were still skeptical of ‘le petit Bonaparte’ as Louis was known by his detractors. Now, however, only the most die hard of the right and left wing remain defiant. Napoleon has seemingly not conquered the French people with guns, but with bread."

napfra.14.t:0 "Fate of the Church"
napfra.14.d:0 "As things calm more and more a new problem has arisen, one of many new problems. This one, however, is as old as France itself. The Church has returned to France and it has begun to aggressively pursue its old influence. In Old France the Church was a central pillar of society almost as important, if not moreso, in many Frenchman’s lives as the government or army. Its support could make or break a political movement and the Church knew it. However, the rise of the Commune, flight of the most important Bishops and Archbishops to North Africa and the nationalization of Church property has done much to uproot it's vast influence. While many of those who fled with us to Africa remain steadfastly devoted to the Church, those who stayed in the Metropole or were born during the Commune, are not. So, the government is left with a question on what to do with the Church. We could support the Church, help it retain its status and no doubt reap the rewards as they use their influence to our benefit. We could also just as easily keep out of it and see where the cards fall. If the Church comes to prominence we just act like we did before, pay deference, and if not then no harm done. However, a third and uniquely French option has also presented itself. Gallicanism is a political philosophy saying that the head of state exerts as much influence over the nation's hierarchy as does the Pope. If we take hold of this idea with both hands we can turn it into a weapon to keep the Faithful loyal to us while also letting it gain its once permissive influence. With that, the Church will act as another vessel of political power, another tool in the box to control the people."

Already we see our French compatriots living free of tyranny and those who had been exiled to Algeria happy to find their land, its rich fields and beautiful cities.\n\nHowever a question arises, our country, although restored, is not as powerful worldwide as before, and, although we are undeniably a great power, we no longer have the same power over world affairs. Most of our compatriots say that French blood has already been spilled too much and that it would be better to stay on our good side, however some members of our staff are pushing us on the contrary to launch a crusade to restore the greatness of France..."

darnfra.1.d:0 "After over a decade of exile and struggle, the civil war between the forces of the True France and the demonic Syndicalists has come to an end, and a pure France has begun to rise from the ashes. Grandmaster Joseph Darnand, leader of the French Legion and savior of France stands atop this reborn nation. With the Liberation finally complete however, has led to questions of just how this new nation is to be governed. While the dominance of the Legion is obvious, the exact nature of her governance of the Metropole is to some debate.\n\nA majority within the Legion clearly and obviously believe that there is no need for change. Afterall, the suturect they created and perfect in exile led to the Liberation of the Homeland. Why change what is already perfect? Others, greatly inspired by our sister Legionaries in Romania, believe that France should be restored into the hands of an Emperor. These Imperialists however, are not pushing for a restoration of the Bonapartes. No, they believe that the only man fit to wear the Imperial Crown is Grandmaster Darnand himself. Finally, a small group of devoted Legionnaires believe we should take our Catholicism to the next level, and formally hand over temporal power to the true Successor to Saint Peter, Pius XII. While the most radical proposal put forward, by placing the Patarich of the West as Head of State, these radical Catholics believe that by doing so we can better ensure that true Legionarite Catholicism is spread throughout the entire Church.\n\nWith the nation now preparing to begin going about the rebuilding of normality, Grandmaster Darnand must make a decision soon, lest indecisiveness plunge France into anarchy like the one she just barely escaped from."

darnfra.2.d:0 "In a Grand Ceremony, His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, has officially been inaugurated as head of the French State. Short of a proper coronation, the Vicar of Christ’s instating, much like the monarchs of old, was durning a most solemn saying of the Mass. Just prior to the consecration of the Body of Christ, the Pope was given the Specter and the Globus Cruciger of the kings of old. Upon receiving them, the Patarich of the West blessed the crowd with them, and all knelt before his majesty.\n\nWith the Pope’s accession, many questions have been raised over just what the rule of the Pope actually will entail. His Holiness's rule over France is something in between the rule of Legion and the monarchs of old, with a heavy theocratic element. While the Pope may have been given nominally complete control over the nation, the Legion and her Grandmaster still remain the ultimate masters of France. Even with this being the case, the Pope has declared this newly christened ‘Vicariate of France’ shall not rest until Rome is reclaimed. Solidifying this, the Pope’s first official act has been to declare the Vicariate a duel union of France and Italy. Regardless, the Eldest Daughter of the Church has finally embraced her calling, and has fully been baptized by Christ’s Bride.  "

For all intents and purposes Joseph Darnand is already Emperor of France. Nobody speaks against him, he thinks of what he wants and like magic his people rush to do it. Instead Darnand shall stay as the Grandmaster of France as he has been for quite some time. This comes to a shock to some of those who claim to have known him. They figured that Darnand was simply a power hungry nepotist who would chase ever lofty titles like a greyhound on the track chases the rabbit. However Darnand has proved, even now so late into his rule, that he is full of surprises."

darnfra.4.t:0 "A New Empire"
darnfra.4.d:0 "Today Joseph Darnand, Grandmaster of France, pins a new title to his ever growing list of honors, Emperor of France. In a grand ceremony reminiscent of the coronation of Napoléon I Darnand was crowned as Emperor Joseph I. The Coronation was attended by anyone of prominence in France, all eager to watch the beginning of a new era in history. Unlike that faithless degenerate Napoléon, Darnand has been crowned personally by the Pope,his Pope, Pius XII. While the Roman Pretender may claim he is nothing but a usurper and a heretic, Darnand knows God favors him, and the true Remnant in France . Now, with the action of simply putting a crown on his head, God’s favor has transferred from Pius to him. With God and the entirety of a unified and devoted France behind him, nothing is out of his reach."

darnfra.5.t:0 "A Pure France"
darnfra.5.d:0 "Darnand found France a nation of degeneracy and pollutants. A nation where the sous-homme ran rampant and everybody proudly and flagrantly rejected their true nature as supermen to sit in the sand and let themselves be consumed by sin and vice. When he seized control, Darnand resolved to fix France’s many problems and give it a spine again and awaken its latent power to utilize it to its fullest extent. A part of Darnand, a small part of course, regrets the bloodshed such a national revival necessitated. His men wasted many tons of ammunition in clearing out the filth from every corner of the nation. It was a grueling campaign necessitating the continued sweep of the same area as many as five times. It's a wonder Darnand could survive the motonany. However as he watches children play in the streets free from the dangers that once plagued this nation, he knows it was all worth it. France is strong, France is powerful and most importantly, France is pure."

darnfra.6.d:0 "Within the ranks of the Legion there are those who are a lot like Darnand. These men are full of drive, full of power and with a grand and unique vision of France. Darnand doesn’t want these men’s talents to go to waste. To that end he has formed the Legionary Council, a group of the most talented and politically reliable Legionnaires from across the nation. Their job shall be twofold. Firstly, they will act as a sort of advisory body to Darnand should he ever require it. For all of his latent talent, Darnand is perfectly aware that there are areas he is not omnipotent in. Secondly, the Council will appoint and remove Legionnaires from positions of power. This will, for one thing, free up a lot of Darnand’s time which had largely been spent routinely flushing the filth from the political pipes since he took power.\n\nWith the Council taking over these responsibilities, he can move onto bigger and better things. It will also give boilerplate Legionnaires something to aspire to. If anyone from any town in France shows enough drive and talent they can be brought up the ladder by the Council. This will keep a competitive spirit in the Legion and keep it from becoming complacent."

darnfra.7.d:0 "While the Legion enjoys a broad powerbase, there is one constituency that has been reluctant to support us, the Veterans. It's an embarrassing state of affairs, as the Legion claims to speak for all patriotic Frenchmen, and who is more patriotic than a soldier? The soldiers have a variety of complaints, not all of them against us and not all of them within our power to fix. However, some of them we can fix.\n\nOne of their largest complaints is a reform to the veterans healthcare service and an increase in military pensions which had been left at a pittance ever since the flight into Exile. Darnand, having listened and sympathized with their plight, has agreed to both raise pensions and launch an extensive reform to allow soldiers to have easy access to the absolute best healthcare in France. Not only that, but political officers and politically reliable veterans have been dispatched to any gathering of retired soldiers of any kind. Through these handouts and direct outreach, Darnand is confident that it won't be long before these true patriots realize just how good we are for the France they fought so hard for."

flavorfra.1.t:0 "The Flag of the Realm"
flavorfra.1.d:0 "With the collapse of the Second Empire we came tantalizingly close to achieving our dream. The Monarchists had a majority in the National Assembly and public fervor was high. The Legitimists and the Orleanists both were even to compromise on supporting a King, Henri, Count of Chambourd as King Henri V, the Legitimist candidate. However since he had no heir, the Orleanists would crown Philippe D’Orlean, Count of Paris after his death. There was just one problem, Count Henri refused to take the throne unless the Revolutionary Tricolour was discarded in favor of the old Royalist fleur-de-lys. This issue was the single sticking point that ended our place in the Sun. Now that we are so close once more we will not let this sticking point screw us again! We will have a new flag, but it will be a variation of the Tricolour the People love so much. It could have the Bourbon Coat of Arms on it, much like the flag of the July Monarchy.

Trenet is a valued cultural icon already and has written hundreds of songs, his most recent only being released a week ago. For him to die fighting the Metropole could hurt the always fragile public morale. However to turn him away out of hand would just make an enemy of a loud public voice. So, the government has come up with a compromise. Despite Trenet having zero combat experience or background he has been rolled into officers training school to lead our men.

Of all the various incidents to take place over the past few weeks, there is one that simply takes the cake.\n\nWhat started as simple target practice, the mighty Démocratie's main gunner miscalculated his shot, and ended by shelling a small village. Immediately upon realizing their mistake, the crew disembarked and went to survey the damage for their incident reports. Most of the crew expected to find a massacre, a bloodbath, but this was not the case. Due to nothing short of divine intervention, not a single soul was lost, and most of the shots fired actually hit meters away, far outside of the small village, with one exception. In the heart of the village's market, there was a single impact site. Within the impact site was what appeared to be the charred remains of a bear and a rooster, who appeared to be fighting over a book. When questioned about this most strange of scenes, the villagers could offer very little.\n Claiming that the bear and rooster had turned up out of nowhere a few weeks prior, the villagers said that the animals never interacted with the people. Staying to themselves, occasionally the two would get into a minor scuffle. As for the book the two were fighting over, while most of it was turned to ash, what remained seemed to be a history of France, until just after the exile. Why these two animals were fighting over a book of history will never be known.

Rising as a businesswoman and as a titan of industry, a visionary fashion designer and parfumist, and a shining feminist icon, Coco Chanel is beloved by millions across France and the wider world, but she has begun to gain far more infamy and spotlight here in our nation recently, specifically due to her outspoken and very public support of our regime, and due to her scandalous escapades as one of the most wealthy and popular socialites of the modern age. A devout anti-semite and anti-Socialist with a personal disdain for cultural vacuums and parasites like the Americas, Coco has long preferred the company of elitists and conservatives. Holding close links to British aristocracy, once even almost marrying the Duke of Westminster, and to the Romanovs as well as to all other manners of European elites, Coco’s worldview is cemented in the Right, even working behind the scenes during the rise of the Parisian Commune in an effort to sabotage Leftist activity both within the public and within her own company. \n\nWith all this in mind, many within our regime have brought up the idea of supporting this avid supporter and wealthy socialite in order to bolster the state and to aid us as we further spread our ideology to all true Frenchmen, for nearly none doubt Coco Chanel’s loyalty to our cause, with two main plans as to how to go about this. First, we could choose to massively subsidize Coco’s Chanel company and its haute couture goods in full force, integrating Chanel as a fundamental part of our civilian economy and as an integral link in our trade network, and pouring our full attention towards expanding Chanel in order to bolster our financial system. Alternatively, we could pour a less substantial but still significant amount of support into the Chanel company, while using the remaining funds to establish an espionage network within the Chanel company with Coco at its head, utilizing her vast network of contacts and allies, as well as her economic reach, in order to spy on the world at large and our potential foes for the good of France.

After initially not hesitating to sign it, he has suddenly begun to think twice. If he were to just give significant autonomy to Algeria, what is to stop any other colony who stayed loyal to us during the Exile to demand the same thing? That would be the end of the Empire. An Empire France had poured so much blood, sweat and tears into building and more importantly maintaining all these centuries. However, to go back on his word would alienate the AA and push some of their member into the growing Algerian opposition to French rule, Although Abbas himself will remain faithful to Maurras.

Along with this, the Vicar of Christ has threatened to excommunicate Darnand and the leadership of the Legion. This flat rejection from the most important man in Christendom of our ideals has led Grandmaster Darnand to conclude something he has long feared. The Church herself has become infected by the vile poison of the Freemasons. This infection was able to reach the highest levels of the Church’s earthly leadership, and swayed the recent Conclave to elect a man who has no right to the Papacy.\n\nWhile a lesser man would submit and pray that his evil influence would be purged by the Hand of the Lord, Joseph Darnand is no such man. No, the Grandmaster must do what is necessary to save the Bride of Christ, and he shall do what he must. To this end, Darnand over the past few days since receiving the Roman Pretender’s response, has been preparing to call a new Conclave. Due to the nature of this emergency, and the lack of Cardinals who know the truth of the Papacy, Darnand has encouraged the French clergy to embrace the historical election of the Pope by the entire Faithful of Rome.  While most clergy that Darnand has approached initially responded negatively, once they were fully made to understand the situation, most of the important members of the Colonial Clergy have formally consented to this new Conclave. Interestingly enough,His Eminence Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant, one of the last people to be made a Cardinal by Pius XI, has come in total support of this new Conclave.

Lefebvre, despite only being a priest, is one of the most traditionalist priests that fill the ranks of the clergy. Upon his election, Father Lefebvre took the name Pius XII, as a way to honor the legacy of the late Pius XI and to show his desire to carry on the legacy of Pius X. Pius XII has, of course, been commended by the Roman Pretender along with most of the Church outside of our bastion of true France.

Rome is the capital of the Church, and is indeed the seat of the Papacy, and with the Successor of Saint Peter being our Head of State it would make sense to move the capital. However, many within the higher ranks of the Legion, Darnand among them, fear that should the Pope return to Rome, he would fall under the same Masonic influence that nearly brought the Church to ruin. Instead, they believe that we should keep the capital, free of all things Masonic,where it is. Those who wish for us to move the capital to the Eternal City frequently bring up the ‘Babylonian Captivity’ of the Avignon Papacy. During which a period of corruption and evil came upon the Church and how it took a literal Saint to bring the Pope back to Rome, finally ending that evil era.

In the ashes of France’s first humiliation Boulanger recognized the failures of democracy. He recognized the inefficiency of a divided and bickering parliament and he clamored for revenge against the Germans. He wanted to reclaim the Lost Provinces and to defeat the hated boche once and for all. For this he became a hero of the populace. However the cabal of kleptocrats and autocrats at the top feared his rising fame and true vision.

He sees our movement and even our government as just another rung on the ladder inevitably leading to him leading all of France. Suffice to say Darnand was not pleased when Taittinger initially took the proposal for a joke and laughed at it for five straight minutes. When Joseph made it clear that the proposal was a serious suggestion, Taittinger carefully laid out just why Darnand’s idea could not happen. Firstly, and most importantly, Darnand was a commoner. He comes from a know nothing family in the asscrack of the Alps. He has no experience in ruling anything other than a pseudo-criminal gang. Secondly Taittinger revealed that there was only one man who could rule France, a Bonaparte. His illustrious lineage and Louis’s devotion to France proved himself the perfect Emperor.

His desire to see a strong and proud nation led to him basically rebuilding Paris and extending mandatory education to girls and women. He also built up the economy by lowering tariffs, dumped obscene amounts of money into modernizing the French economy and infrastructure and even began to give concessions to liberals in his later reign. They admit that he did do some bad stuff, but it was all in the pursuit of the greater good. However, others seek to focus on just how he was able to do such amazing things. They point out, also rightly, that Napoléon overthrew the National Assembly and dissolved the Second Republic that he himself led. He only ‘legalized’ his illegal coup in a retroactive plebiscite that was so lopsided in favor of the newly minted Emperor that it couldn’t have been anything but a fraud. Not only that but once in power he waged multiple bloody wars for little to no gain across Europe and even the world.

With this being the case, the Action Française dominated parliament has presented a bill that would organize a referendum on weather or not the Monarchy should be restored to the President.

However, after a perilous four hour operation the doctors came back with a surprising prognosis. One of the bullets hit his right humerus and did only minor damage as it entered the arm, another passed through his arm almost harmlessly. The third shot however was the most surprising. The bullet had hit him right square in the middle of his chest and doctors initially feared it had pierced his heart. However De Gaulle had apparently sewn a folded up picture of his daughter Anne over his heart. The picture, while punched right through, was remarkably thick enough to slow the bullet down just enough so that it only hit his sternum but failed to get past it and into his heart. De Gaulle, while having to spend a few weeks in the hospital to recover, shall be fine. When he finally regained consciousness reportedly the first thing he asked was “Where is Anne?”.

Among these treasures, it is said, was an ancient tome containing hidden lore and secrets that would shatter the world should they be revealed to the general public. Also among these long lost items was allegedly the shared remains of a sword, said to grant the user great power in battle and over the hearts of men. It is also said that every single one of the men who uncovered and cataloged the vault were killed, although the rumors disagree if they were killed all at once or over a short period. Either way, the government has and continues to deny these rumors as not but hogwash. In other news, Prime Minister Deloncle, as part of his uniform, now carries a sword that seems to glow a faint yellow, and has been repeatedly sighted reading something known as the 'Codex Pater Intellectus.'

This exclamation caused almost instant chaos. As the crowd bubbled with excitement, De Gaulle’s next statement threw them into a near riotous state. De Gaulle, after hinting early in the day at supporting the Quebecois in their struggle for independence when he commented on France’s ‘evolving’ relations with the Canadian province, shouted “Vive le Quebec libre!” putting an emphasis on the libre. The crowd of mostly Quebecois, many of whom remembered and despised the British for their crushing of the liberation movement during the Weltkrieg, surged forwards to the plane and De Gaulle.\n\nDe Gaulle for his part initially seemed like he wanted to go back to them but was physically dragged into the plane by his security and accompanying government officials. Reportedly the quotes were quickly spread through the province and caused an uptick of Quebec nationalist sentiment. This has also caused a cooling of relations between Canada and France with the Canadian Prime Minister summoning the French ambassador for a long and passionate rebuke, a rebuke he then read to the people over the radio later that night.

However, the Dark Heart of the Dark Continent is fraught with danger and filled with death and disease, especially to outsider colonials who know little of how to live in such a foreign land, and some believe that the German colonial system in Africa is looming towards collapse. Luckily Mordacq has some experience surviving in Africa due to his time serving in Algeria both during the 1880s and again during the rise of the Commune in Paris, but the sand dunes of Algeria are a far different beast to tame than the dangerous jungle eden of the Congo.

Famed for their frequently wild manes, which sometimes stretch over the shoulder and under the belly to the elbows of these massive predators, and for their immense power and dangerous natural beauty, this dying breed of lions perfectly exemplifies how France was once the dominant power of their land, but have now been reduced to a small and exiled population in this sandy hell. \n\nWith this similarity in mind, the Lion of Verdun Philippe Pétain has moved to save these beasts from extinction. Raising the Barbary lion as a symbol of both his own office and the French state, and even taking a pair of young cubs as pets of his own, Marshal Pétain has moved to create a conservation program aimed at saving these beasts and the other mystifying wildlife of our temporary home such as the similarly endangered North African leopard, drawing in all their surrounding surviving populations from Algiers, Morocco, and the rest of North Africa into protected reserves and conservationist regions.

It is suggested that during a passionate bout of oral sex, the President’s heart simply gave out, with his mistress’ lips being the true cause of his myocardial infarction rather than the stress of statecraft. Many have been quick to draw parallels to the death of Félix Faure in 1899, who died of a stroke after his infamous mistress Marguerite Steinheil blew him; his lifeless and rigid hands locking in her hair as he died before he was rushed to the hospital as it made national news.

Nearly the entirety of the Guyanese people, from the majority group the Indo-Guyanese to the more dominant Afro-Guyanese and the Franco-Guyanese and the White colonials, have come together in order to support our cause, and despite a few chips in the foundation being eaten away by parasitic radicals, Guyane has largely persevered as a steadfast ally to the cause of ‘National’ France.

As an alternative, they suggest that we should offer a closer step towards Guyanese independence within the wider French sphere instead. Likely to be more palatable to the native Guyanese, this option would see esteemed colonial leader, native Afro-Guyanese hero, and known French loyalist Adolphe Sylvestre Félix Éboué as leader of a Guyanese protectorate, offering the Guyanese a token sense of self-rule while still being entirely beholden and shackled to our regime and to our economy. Félix Éboué is known for his close friendship with de Gaulle, for his uncanny footballer skills, his dedication to promoting peaceful and mutually beneficial cooperation between France and its colonial holdings, and for being the first Black man to hold a high office in the colonial administration of France, serving in French Africa’s colonial regime for two decades before being moved to the French Caribbean and beyond. Doing so would lose us direct control over a strip of jungle thousands of miles away from the Metropole, but would gain us a sure ally and puppet in South America fully linked to our growing sphere of influence and to our trade network without the hassle of directly overseeing a New World holding.

flavorfra.45.d:0 "There was once a man who saw France as it should be. This man, Francois Guizot, fought tooth and nail so that those who worked hard and had a stake in the nation led it. The liberals decry him for ‘restricting liberties’ but he was one of the few to see that letting a do nothing lead the nation is only asking for trouble. Only those who have a vested interest in the prosperity of France, the men and those with lands, should have a say in how France should be run! If you could enrichissez-vous, enrich yourself, before you can enrich the nation. Not only that but he did things even the far left would adore. He was an avid lover of education and was the man who oversaw the expansion of the school system to every commune. If it weren't for the debasing influence of unchecked liberal idealism he could have formed France into a state to be proud of. We shall honor him for all he did for us in his time and all can agree that it is long overdue."

flavorfra.46.t:0 "A Fight at the Top of the State!"
flavorfra.46.d:0 "Today Maxime Weygand, top military man in France, stormed out of Prime Minister Reynaud’s office, his face contorted with rage and Reynaud screaming after him. This is a scene that has become distressingly common in recent months. Reynaud, despite being political leader of France, has begun to see himself as a military leader as well as political. He has begun to send orders to Weygand telling him where to station troops, how to train them and what equipment to distribute. Weygand despises such overreach. He sees the Army as his domain alone and has done everything in his power to resist Reynaud’s ‘asinine’ orders. This has landed him frequently in hot water and if it weren't for Weygand’s idolization after his role in the liberation of the metropole, Reynaud would have fired him months ago. This most recent row was over Reynaud ordering Weygand to send some units back to Algeria to parade through Oran while Weygand needed them to put down some Syndicalist rabble rousers. The shouting match lasted for nearly half an hour and afterwards Weygand allegedly wrote a resignation letter. He was about to hand it in but was talked down by his chief of staff who pointed out that Reynaud would put a lackey in his place and run the Army himself. For all he hated Reynaud Weygand loved his Army more, so he refrained from resigning. Instead he put it in his desk, for later he says."

flavorfra.47.d:0 "Adolphes Thiers is a complicated man for our Republic to venerate. He was at first a monarchist but, after Charles X exercised his power over the Chamber of Deputies he turned against the institution. Afterwards he however remained a staunch conservative and supporter of a Republic as it was, not as it ‘should be’ according to students and those who haven't known actual power. As Prime Minister he put down the First Commune effectively and with resolve, then managed to get the damned Boche occupiers out of France two years ahead of schedule. Such achievements alone are worthy of veneration. He also oversaw the return of Napoleon the Great’s ashes to France, saw France through the Oriental Crisis and helped with the establishment and early leadership of the Third Republic. All of this and more show just how great a man he was, a true Frenchman."

flavorfra.48.d:0 "As Prime Minister Louis Marin walks through the streets of Paris he has begun to demonstrate his unique sense of style. Any time anybody sees him, be it the twilight of the dawn or dark midnight he is seen in a formal three piece suit, a now iconic pussy bow with white dots and a great mustache like the Gallic chieftains of old. This demonstration has hit off a new fad across the nation which has become a rather popular fashion trend. Even those who profess a hatred of Marin have been spotted trying to emulate his style. All of this seemingly amuses the Prime Minister to some degree, even if he admits that none will look quite as good as he does."

flavorfra.49.d:0 "Georges Boulanger is a French General who is seen as the father of the French right for his hatred of the Germans. However he is much more than that. He is also a fierce patriot who wished for a Republic with a strong executive, much like us. He wanted revenge on the Germans for their humiliations of France, just like us. And just like us he wanted to make sure all Frenchmen were blessed by God and the Catholic church, just like us. Unfortunately he was unable to pursue this dream as he was chased into exile by the liberals and killed himself. This man was truly the model Frenchman. As such we have begun to raise statues of him across the nation, giving him the honor and glory that he deserved so long ago."

The French people adore him for leading them through the Exile with a strong yet steady hand and a single word from him can make or break a government. As our support remains worrying low we have sent envoys to him to ask him to come out in support for us. While we were expecting a bit of a struggle we found that Petain willingly accepted us. A few days later all of France was glued to their radios as Petain gave his last public address. In it he launched numerous venomous broadsides against the factional parliamentary republic and praised us for our efforts in combating these men who want nothing but power. His words were measured, restrained even but the venom dripping behind them was clear for all to hear. After the Marshal was finished we suddenly found the wheels of power much better greased than before. Even those who still oppose us follow our lead, lest they get voted in the next election."

He fought valiantly at Sedan and then he fought valiantly leading the troops that crushed the First Commune. He wanted a King to lead France and he got so tantalizing close. Through wheeling and dealing he got the Orleanists and the Legitimists to agree on supporting Henri V, Count of Chambourd. However Henri dithered over a flag of all things and the Republicans were able to rally enough support to snuff out the new monarchy before it happened. If he were alive, he would support our course that we follow today. As such we shall raise him to the heroic heights he almost achieved himself all those years ago. He is a true Frenchman, and all will know so."

They were eventually apprehended and told police that they did it because he was ‘a puppet of the Jewish masters’ and a liberal. While Maurras  hates Camille with a passion so, personally, is only sad that they didn’t kill him, he also realizes that he is not popular. Meanwhile, for all his faults, Camille is. So, to salvage the situation he has ordered the Camelots punished as harshly as possible. Meanwhile, Maurras  will grit his teeth and issue a public condemnation of the attack. Some suggest that Maurras  should go and speak to Camille personally, at least for the benefit of the cameras. However, Maurras  has dismissed the proposition. He knows that if we were to go visit him there was a non zero chance he would kill Camille himself."

flavorfra.53.d:0 "With our armies now marching into West Africa, the colonial dominion of Togoland has now fallen under our control. Traditionally ruled over by the Germans since the colony's inception in 1884, the colony now lies in our hands, and we must decide what to do with it. We could simply annex Togoland as a new colony of the French Empire, or we could revive an old plan to split the colony in two between French and Anglo regimes. Alternatively, we could revive a small part of the dead ‘Little Entente’ idea by offering this colonial land to the newly-freed Czechs, for they too have a claim to this land from their old colonial exploits that never came to pass. Doing so would make way for a possible alliance with them as well. What should we do?"

First thought of by Czech adventurer Jan Havlasa along with the orientalists Alois Musil and Emil Holub, Czechoslovak Togo was a proposed concept of the Czech people creating a colony in Togo, with the idea also have plans for other African regions as well as for far-off places like New Guinea in Oceania. Though the plan never came to be, the spirit of its ideas still live on within some warhawks within our cabinet, and now the French have offered to hand this colony to us on a silver platter. Doing so would beholden us to them, likely forcing us to join their alliance, but that could be beneficial to our infantile state in the long run. What should we do? "

This war bears a meaning to our people no one outside our borders can understand. Marechal Petain is a very elderly man, and though it pains many of our citizens and administrators to see him have to continue to work tirelessly for our nation, the Lion has never been more steeled.

When our honor is at stake, a nation like ours, forged in the crucible of races and passions, proud and courageous, is ready for sacrifice as for violence. Together we have built a France free, powerful and prosperous. Through much effort, France has been rehabilitated. Those responsible for your misfortunes who led France astray are gone, and the sovereignty of grateful and adoring France has been reclaimed.\n\nThe National Revolution has come to its climax. You have waited with me for better times, and now, the trials of France will have an end. My life is not my own. It belongs to France, my people, and the dead. I know, then, by my calling, what defeat is; I see today what victory is. Victory is a France that no longer suffers in soul and flesh. Victory is a France free of impurities that history has punished.\n\nThe Reich has never before seen Frenchmen with their consciences pure, today we will begin to show them.

Though the great leader continues to deliver greatness for our country, he is now almost 90 years of age. Pétain outright considers himself incapable of working more than four hours in a day, and has shifted his schedule to using those as productively as possible.\n\nIn meetings and discussions, Pétain is much more apathetic to the current events and issues presented to him by his subordinates. In fact, most advisors agree it is difficult to keep Maréchal Pétain engaged in conversation for more than fifteen minutes. In longer sessions, he outright cannot be kept from his slumber.\n\nEven when involved in deliberation, issues the Lion is less familiar with tend to thoroughly confuse him. Even more unfortunately, he has developed a tendency to repeat 10 to 20 times the same observation or communication in the course of a day or several days, if he feels strongly about it.\n\nFortunately, the Maréchal tends to perform at his best around visitors, and episodes of lucidity transform him once more into the effective leader he truly is. After dedicating his entire life to serving France, Petain is conflicted about slowing down in private. When alone, he often grows melancholic about the state of affairs. But with the help of his countrymen in this new era of unparalleled prosperity, Pétain is beginning to view this as the perfect opportunity for the to transition the administrative affairs of the country to those younger leaders who strive to follow in his footsteps, while he continues to guide France as a public model for all Frenchmen."

As Regent Shoe has apparently been using his position to forward his own Calvinist beliefs. As a part of this alleged plot by the Regent, a planned ceremony to dedicate Notre Dame to Our Lady once more was halted by Imperial agents, claiming they were acting in thr name of the Regent.\n\nAfyer a small discussion, the agents left with the Bishop leading the dedication in toe, leaving it unfinished. With this being the case, Prime Minister Taittinger has approached the Regent in secret, asking him to refrain in future from making such crass actions and release the Bishop at once. The Regent, much to his  dismay, released the bishop and make vague promises of never again attempting to enforce Protestantism on Catholic France. However, it appears that the last promise was a lie, as state funding continues to flow as a river into Calvinist missions.\n\nRegardless, it seems the Regent may not have been as neutral as we have hoped after all."

Aside from addressing a few subjects he is deeply passionate about, our leader’s speeches no longer appear as rousing, glorious, or even coherent as in years past. This issue came to a head yesterday, after Maréchal Pétain delivered an assessment of the progress of the National Revolution just before his eighty-ninth birthday celebration. The oration started strong, with Pétain emphasizing the values of the National Revolution and describing the character of France. \n\nHowever, a few minutes in, the Lion could not begin to recall the events of 1944. Moments later, he could not remember what he had just been saying. After a full minute and a half of silently muttering and attempting to collect his words, Pétain began to ramble about his wish to return to France, despite being in the Élysée Palace. After a slight time spent expressing his disappointment and loneliness, Pétain was gently escorted inside. A minister clarified to the concerned audience that the President was simply battling stress and excitement on his birthday. \n\nA vibrant celebration was held, but during the meal the Maréchal talked for a time with a visitor; only to see her again at the end of festivities and ask that he be introduced to him once more as though he had never seen her. \n\nWhile the celebration was prevented from becoming a disaster, it still has generated rumors that the leadership has struggled to censor. Pétain’s inner circle has agreed to limit the public appearances of their superior, and has seen fit to assume almost all administrative and deliberative responsibilities to protect the President, formally from overworking and stress, but truly because his mind has become numb."

In a short speech given over the radio to his people Petain has declared martial law in effect ‘for the foreseeable future’. This announcement has smothered the coming elections and dampened the hopes of aspiring Democrats in France and abroad. Instead it seems like the Military will be guiding France into the future. All the state apparatuses are already under the control of the Marshal's followers and there was a marked personality cult around the Hero of Verdun, one of the facets of the new 'National Revolution', the official ideology of the Junta. The new policies of the Junta include, among others numerous measures, a great militarization of society, a return to Catholicism and traditional values, and a strong stratification of society."

Marshal Petain has upheld his promise to return to democracy by appointing Louis Marin as Premier with a Cabinet of known democrats. While France has a long way to go to true democracy since Petain still retains massive influence over the ship of state, they have taken the first important step today. Louis Marin, leader of the traditional right-wing party Fédération Républicaine, however, announced his intention to create a cabinet bringing together all democratic political tendencies, from the Radicals to the right-wing Republicans, all united in the goal of democratizing French society and dismantling of the oppressive apparatus of the Junta."

Now it seems Maurras was cashing in on his newfound favor, big time. Jean III, nicknamed 'The Old King', made a great speech to the French people in which he called for unity, stability and a return to the 'traditional order of things'.

However, this pope was not the Bishop of Rome who currently rules in Rome, no this was an entirely new Pontifex Maximus. Spurred on by disagreements with the Church, the Catholic Church within France has now split from Rome, at the behest of the French ‘Grandmaster’ Joseph Darnand. The new pope, once known as Marcel Lefebvre, has taken the name Pius XII, and is an ultra traditionalist. Rome, along with a majority of the Catholic Church, have decried this schism, while the new Pope and his Legionary backers claim they will not rest until Rome is under her rightful Pontiff.

Prior to this Conclave, the man elected to replace Pius XI, and seen by most as the legitimate Pope, formally resigned his office. Pius XII, since assuming his office, has proved to be one of the most traditionalist popes in recent memory.

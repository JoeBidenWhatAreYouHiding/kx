NFA_focus:0 "French Republic Focus Tree"

NFA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the French Revolution of 1919, the discredited parliamentary government, having evacuated to Algiers, was rapidly toppled by Ferdinand Foch, who consolidated his military junta until his death in 1929. His successor, Philippe Pétain, has so far taken a more conciliatory attitude to the forces of democracy, reconciling with liberal-conservatives and delegating some power to the Assembly. However, Pétain's simultaneous ties to the deeply Catholic and nationalist Croix-de-Feu, and increasing discontent with parliamentary power within the military, is sure to cause trouble as the National French prepare to take back their homeland..."

NFA_troops_on_the_streets_desc:0 "With the political crisis reaching breaking point, and the junta embittered against civilian politics, Maréchal Pétain has given into the pressure, and taken the fateful decision to forcibly occupy the Assembly. The last sembalances of democratic rule are being swept away, with the Junta now focused on re-organising and militarising the state and society, while a rump parliament rubber-stamps its laws in the presence of armed soldiers."
NFA_demand_the_assemblys_loyalty:0 "Ensure the Assembly's Loyalty"
NFA_demand_the_assemblys_loyalty_desc:0 "Civilian politicians can be allowed to undermine national unity and our preparations for the liberation no longer. It is time to put a stop to their disloyalty and petty bickering. As such, we must ensure that the civilian politicians of the nation understand their secondary and advisory role to the President, and decide what to do with their parties."
NFA_a_new_premier:0 "A New Premier"
NFA_a_new_premier_desc:0 "Since his self-coup, Pétain has ruled alone as both President and Prime Minister. However, the old marshal has never enjoyed day-to-day administration, and nor does he have the time to engage in such matters while pre-occupied as both Head of State and a senior general. As such, he has resolved to delegate his position to a loyal member of his clique in the army, and leave ordinary matters of state to them, allowing for a more capable and efficient government."
NFA_a_new_constitution:0 "Suspend the Constitution"
NFA_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "Although our consolidation of power over the last months has been vital for France to be saved, it has hardly been legal. In order to legitimise the continued dictatorship, and further free ourselves from divisive civilian politics, we must suspend the Constitution of the Third Republic, giving the Maréchal a freer hand to lead France to glory, and liberate our brothers and sisters in the métropole."
NFA_memories_of_verdun:0 "Memories of Verdun"
NFA_memories_of_verdun_desc:0 "It was the Battle of Verdun in 1916, when he heroically held off the German swine, that truly made Pétain's career. and endeared him to the people. Now, with more great battles, this time to free France itself, on the horizon, we must revive the memories of the heroism of the Great War: not least the heroism of Pétain himself, whose populairty will doubtless recieve a significant boost from our campaigns."
NFA_seek_clergy_support:0 "Seek Support from the Clergy"
NFA_seek_clergy_support_desc:0 "The secularism of the republic has long alienated the Catholic church, with good Catholic men and women often drawn to needlessly radical movements in response. However, now that much of the republic has been swept away, and with many right-wing Catholics supportive of Pétain's strong and assertive leadership, we have a golden opportunity to mend our relations with the Church. By meeting with prominent clergymen and displaying Pétain's own faith, we shall truly endear ourselves to the God-fearing common man."
NFA_morality_and_service:0 "Morality and Service"
NFA_morality_and_service_desc:0 "With the clergy and army behind us, we can deepen our rhetoric of social conservatism and militarism, emphasising that traditional values go hand in hand with patriotism and self-sacrifice. By reiviving the memory of French heroes of ages past, and encouraging patriotic sermons from the clergy, we can show to the people that it is their Christian duty to their part to free France."
NFA_chantiers_de_jeunesse:0 "Chantiers de la Jeunesse"
NFA_chantiers_de_jeunesse_desc:0 "In order to bolster our support and position, and promote patriotism and family values, a new initiative has been proposed: camps at which young men will stay for a period of time where they will be taught to love God, to value hard work, and to love nature, besides absorbing a great deal of patriotism and respect for the Maréchal in the process."
NFA_cult_of_the_marechal:0 "The Cult of the Maréchal"
NFA_cult_of_the_marechal_desc:0 "Over the past months, our propaganda iniatives and traditionalist policies have caused Pétain's personal popularity to skyrocket. Reminded of his heroism at Verdun, and shown that he is a good Catholic dedicated to France, the people have increasingly come to support the old marshal, knowing him to be a responsible and determined man, under whose leadership France will prosper. It would be wise to encourage this immense popularity, and capitalise on it to further entrench our government."
NFA_la_revolution_nationale:0 "La Révolution Nationale"
NFA_la_revolution_nationale_desc:0 "With the abolishment of many republican institutions, the end of pretences of democracy, and our return to traditional values, a great change has come over French society. Maréchal Pétain has embraced this, proclaiming it the 'National Revolution': the true French spirit has forcefully asserted itself once more, and all who oppose it, be they republican demagogues or socialist traitors, will be swept away."
NFA_our_sole_purpose:0 "Our Sole Purpose"
NFA_our_sole_purpose_desc:0 "With the army now well and truly in charge of France, we are at last free to focus on the one great purpose for which the Military Government exists: the liberation of France. Whether or not we believe dictatorship to be right in the long term, we must embrace strong leadership so long as we are in exile, for only that can free us from the communard scum. Without the vested powers of the republic, we can now vastly expand our military investments."
NFA_militarise_society:0 "Militarise Society"
NFA_militarise_society_desc:0 "If France is to be liberated, the whole population must be dedicated to the great task before us. It will be no easy feat, but it must be done if we are once more to be among our fellow Frenchmen in liberty and under God. As such, we must promote militaristic culture and patriotism among the people, to ready the nation for the great war that looms ahead, and to legitimise our rule."
NFA_everything_for_the_liberation:0 "Everything for the Liberation"
NFA_everything_for_the_liberation_desc:0 "The great effort to free France will require the total commitment, total dedication, of every single patriot. Nobody can be found slacking, and all must do their duty for the patrie. Only through the shared determination of the whole nation can we hope to see the beauty of Paris once again. As such, we must use our propaganda to emphasise the need for total dedication, and greatly tighten conscription."
NFA_work_with_loyal_businesses:0 "Work with Loyal Businesses"
NFA_work_with_loyal_businesses_desc:0 "Pétain's regime has always enjoyed good relations with the world of business, and with our consolidation of power we can further capitalise on this. By granting favourable deals to businessmen who can prove their loyalty, and encouraging ideas of patriotism and class co-operation among business leaders, we can use our ties to the free market to greatly strengthen our hand."
NFA_arms_subsidies:0 "Arms Subsidies"
NFA_arms_subsidies_desc:0 "If there's one thing we need more than anything to free France, it's the arms and ammunition to wage war against an enemy that outnumbers us by many scores. As such, it is simply essential that we encourage business leaders to invest in armament production, by heavily subsidising the industry and offering less... official favourable treatment to those who can supply it."
NFA_la_france_enivree:0 "La France Enivrée"
NFA_la_france_enivree_desc:0 "There is one thing we must never forget, and that is that France is still held prisoner under Communard tyranny. Every day, good Catholics and valiant patriots suffer under the boot of Godless socialist scum, forced to live under a warmongering and degenerate regime. Not until our countrymen no longer have to suffer such a vile assault on their rights and faith can we resume the 'normality' of which our opponents love to speak."
NFA_unity_in_struggle:0 "Unity in Struggle"
NFA_unity_in_struggle_desc:0 "The task that lies before us, the task of setting the métropole free from the socialist filth, will be far from easy. We can expect no small amount of pain, loss, and bloodshed. But if there is one good thing that we can expect, it is unity and brotherhood among the people. All will share in the fight to free France, all will share in our triumphs and tragedies. And finally, after all the hardship and struggle, all will share in the freedom and peace that it is our mission to restore to the French people."
NFA_the_lion_roars:0 "The Lion Roars"
NFA_the_lion_roars_desc:0 "With our consolidation of power complete, and our preparations to reclaim the métropole well underway, the roar of the Lion of Verdun now resounds from Algiers, across Europe and Africa alike. The socialist filth must know that we are more than ready to crush them, and send them to hell where they belong, and they must know that the fateful day when we shall do so is drawing ever closer! Vive le Maréchal!"

### AF ###

NFA_la_restauration:0 "La Restauration"
NFA_la_restauration_desc:0 "With the AF's position in the government secure, we can make good on our promises to restore the Duc de Guise, Jean d'Orléans, to the French throne. With his influence rapidly giving way to the AF, on whom he is becoming reliant for continued support, Pétain shall have to oversee the transition from republic to monarchy, as his junta withers away."
NFA_emphasise_maurrasisme:0 "Emphasise Maurrasisme"
NFA_emphasise_maurrasisme_desc:0 "With the new AF government in place, Charles Maurras can at last seek to implement his integral nationalist ideals. Rooted in the rational need for order and hierarchy to guide society, Maurrasian ideology is the only tangible solution to France's countless problems. By siezing the initiative and forcing through sweeping legislation, and promoting his political literature, Maurras can at last show the whole nation the light of his ideology."
NFA_anti_parliamentarisme:0 "Anti-Parliamentarisme"
NFA_anti_parliamentarisme_desc:0 "There can be no doubt as to what doomed the French nation in the Weltkrieg and subsequent revolution. It was the weakness and bickering of republican politicians, and the division between Frenchmen caused by multi-party democracy, which led to our fall. Such a pathetic political situation can continue no longer, and the error of Pétain's tolerance the Assembly can finally be corrected. Having amassed the political capital to at last do so, the Maurras cabinet will put the Assembly in its place for good."
NFA_empower_the_camelots:0 "Empower the Camelots"
NFA_empower_the_camelots_desc:0 "The AF's paramilitary and youth group, the Camelots du Roi, has long been an invaluable asset of the party, dominating street fights against many unsavoury elements and teaching Maurrasian values to the French youth. Now that we have taken power, we can empower the Camelots within the government, granting them extensive powers and settling on a clearer purpose for the organisation."
NFA_classical_inspiration:0 "Classical Inspiration"
NFA_classical_inspiration_desc:0 "France is, fundamentally, a Latin and Mediterranean nation, and the roots of French civilisation are the Greek colonies on the southern coast of France and the Roman territories of Gaul. As such, the ideals and philosophy of the classical world must be the basis for French politics, and appreciation of the classics must be popularised in French culture. Long a proponent of classicism, Maurras intends to further popularise these ideals."
NFA_break_the_four_estates:0 "Break the Four Estates"
NFA_break_the_four_estates_desc:0 "Maurras has long identified the fundamental enemies of our civilisation, the anti-France, as being formed of "four confederate estates", namely Protestants, Jews, Freemasons, and immigrants, or, to use the ancient Athenian term, Metics. These four subversive elements have undermined France for centuries, spreading any number of insidious ideologies and enslaving the common Frenchman. It is time to finally break up their influence, if we are to ever have a chance of liberating France."
NFA_localist_ideals:0 "Localist Ideals"
NFA_localist_ideals_desc:0 "Vital to the Maurrasian ideology is an emphasis on localism and regional liberties. Although the circumstances of our exile makes it impossible for us to put this into practice, the government has resolved to form regional commitees of supportive exiles, ready to assume the reigns of local administration when the time comes, and to lay the legislative groundwork for the decentrlisation of the State, which can be put into practice after the Liberation."
NFA_smash_global_finance:0 "Smash High Finance"
NFA_smash_global_finance_desc:0 "If France is to be truly independent, it must free itself from the shackles of rootless finance, with all its corruption, subversion, and Jewish influence. Even today, the bankers at the top are growing fat while decent Frenchmen toil in poverty. This can go on no longer, and it is time for the state to step in and break up corrupt foreign and Jewish businesses."
NFA_sacred_traditions:0 "The Necessity of Hierarchy"
NFA_sacred_traditions_desc:0 "In truth, modern ideals of democracy and liberalism amount to little more than a tyranny of finance and of mob rule, while socialist and most radical right-wing states are even less subtle in their tyranny. The only state that can grant the people genuine freedom is a traditionalist one, built on a natural hierarchy with the King at the top, using necessary authority to guide the people without devolving into a petty tyranny. It is such a state that we must build in France."
NFA_work_with_abbas:0 "Work with Abbas"
NFA_work_with_abbas_desc:0 "For some years now, the AF has enjoyed the support and assistance of the Action Algerienne, an Algerian Arab party inspired by our own movement and ideology. Its leader, Ferhat Abbas, is a staunch admirer of Maurras, and is glad to accpet an autonomous Algeria within the Kingdom of France. It is thus obvious that we should reach out to him and his party, integrating them into the government, to win favour among the Algerian population."
NFA_cultural_revivals_among_exiles:0 "French Traditions"
NFA_cultural_revivals_among_exiles_desc:0 "The many local cultures and traditions of France, from Brittany to Provence and Corsica to Normandy, are each beautiful and unique, and it is the duty of any truly French government to do its utmost to preserve each one. These traditions are under attack each day from the Communard tyrants, and it is down to us to liberate every distinct part of France from their grip. Promoting revivals of local culture among the exiles, and organising them based on their region of origin, will galvanise support for the liberation."
NFA_royal_corporatism:0 "Royal Corporatism"
NFA_royal_corporatism_desc:0 "The unrestrained capitalism of today is destructive to regional liberty and to traditional values, and it is vital that we take a stance against it. However, socialism is an equally nagative system, and we must seek an alternative, reorganising the economy into state-controlled corporations. With the economy under state supervision, we will be able to proactively ready it for the liberation, and break what remains of foreign influence."
NFA_end_romanticism:0 "End Romanticism"
NFA_end_romanticism_desc:0 "One of the greatest evils of the 19th century was the growth of romanticism in art and literature. A deviant movement, an affront to tradition and to the high standards of the Classics, the spread of romanticism went hand in hand with that of liberalism, and we cannot truly free ourselves from one without freeing ourselves from the other. As such, the government must take action to promote true and time-honoured forms of art, infinitely superior to the degenerate movement of the last century."
NFA_support_native_elites:0 "Support Native Elites"
NFA_support_native_elites_desc:0 "The aid of local native rulers has always sustained French colonial rule in Africa. Now, however, this support gives us a perfect opportunity to put Maurras's localist principles into practice. By granting native rulers greater autonomy and self-rule, conditional of course on loyalty to France and contributions to the Liberation, we can perfect the practical means of decentralising the state, and strengthen native acceptance of colonial rule."
NFA_order_and_reason:0 "Order and Reason"
NFA_order_and_reason_desc:0 "Above all else, the state must maintain order and decency in society, and doing so necessitates the use of force. Force, however, is worthless and tyrannical without a higher reason and a higher purpose to guide it. In the integral nationalist doctrine of Maurras, we have that purpose, and in the Camelots du Roi and military we have the force. The Kingdom must be accepted by all good Frenchmen, and in exchange all good Frenchmen will enjoy rational and orderly governance."
NFA_mend_relations_with_the_holy_see:0 "Mend Relations with the Holy See"
NFA_mend_relations_with_the_holy_see_desc:0 "The last great barrier to Maurras's rule is the AF's estrangement from the Papacy and Holy See. Although the Church should be one of our greatest allies, and would normally be supportive of a traditionalist and counter-revolutionary monarchy, they have long been alienated by Maurras's own agnosticism, and his view of the Church as little more than a politically convenient force, as opposed to the Ministry of Christ. We must take measures to end this rift."
NFA_ancient_liberties:0 "Liberty Through Authority"
NFA_ancient_liberties_desc:0 "Although the creation of an authoritarian state is used all too frequently by tyrants, authority can exist perfectly well without tyranny, and indeed is needed to avoid tyranny. Only through the authoritarianism of the state can we keep at bay global finance, the Four Estates, socialism, and every other evil waiting to oppress the French people. Our authority alone is what guarantees genuine liberty."
NFA_the_kingdom_from_the_ashes:0 "The Kingdom Reborn"
NFA_the_kingdom_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "At last, after every trial and tribulation, the great Kingdom of France stands proud once again, confident in the justice of its system and the rightness of its purpose. United under His Majesty and Maurras's cabinet, with the military's loyalty assured, we stand ready to liberate our French brothers and sisters in the Commune, and to restore French greatness to the world. Vive la France, et vive le Roi!"
NFA_celebrate_joan_of_arc:0 "Celebrate Jeanne d'Arc"
NFA_celebrate_joan_of_arc_desc:0 "The symbol of the republic, Marianne, encaspulates everything wrong with that decrepit State. Depicted in filthy clothes and barely dressed, Marianne represents perfectly the poverty and decadence of Republican France. A preferable alternative to such a filthy idol is Jeanne d'Arc, French hero of the 100 Years' War and a revered saint. By popularising her heroics, we can promote the AF's values further."

NFA_the_colonel_at_the_helm:0 "De la Rocque at the Helm"
NFA_the_colonel_at_the_helm_desc:0 "In order to restore support for his presidency and for the military, Philippe Pétain has appointed Colonel François de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu, as his new Premier. As de la Rocque, despite his military past, is the first civilian premier since 1919, this marks a major step, and according to some, the beginning of the end of the junta. Either way, de la Rocque now his a free hand to implement his Catholic and corporatist policies across the nation."
NFA_defang_the_assembly:0 "Defang the Assembly"
NFA_defang_the_assembly_desc:0 "Parliamentary weakness and bickering has been a thorn in the side of the Republic for long enough. It was the division and chaos of parliamentary government that doomed us in the Great War and revolution, and it would be madness to suggest that Foch's coup in 1919 was anything but justified. As such, we must finally put a stop to the parliamentarism that divides us even today, concentrating power in the President, Premier, and cabinet."
NFA_military_alliances:0 "Military Co-Operation"
NFA_military_alliances_desc:0 "De la Rocque is the first civilian to be appointed Premier since the coup in 1919, and understandably many officers are concerned that their political influence will come to an end. It is crucial that we assauge these fears, by meeting with prominent generals and explaining our shared values and goals, offering them government posts and reassuring them of our good intentions."
NFA_support_patriotic_industrialists:0 "Align Patriotic Industrialists"
NFA_support_patriotic_industrialists_desc:0 "Rightwing businessmen, socially conscious and nationalistic, have long been crucial supporters of the Croix-de-Feu, their funds working magic for the party's continued success. We should reward these good men with government positions and contracts, and thus further incentivise other wealthy businessmen to join their ranks."
NFA_strike_hidden_socialism:0 "Strike at Hidden Socialism"
NFA_strike_hidden_socialism_desc:0 "For years now, de la Rocque has warned the nation of "hidden socialism", a nefarious enemy within. Now that we are in power, we can finally begin investigating and stamping out socialist and Communard infiltration. The Deuxieme Bureau, a longstanding bastion of anti-socialism, will be given extended powers to detect and fight socialism, investigating opposition politicians and others who remain sceptical of the government."
NFA_bolster_the_mass_movement:0 "Bolster the Mass Movement"
NFA_bolster_the_mass_movement_desc:0 "The Croix-de-Feu has come a long way from its origins as a veterans' association, and, since being reformed into a political party in 1933, has gained a mess membership unprecedented for French parties, with its own newspapers, security services, and youth groups. If de la Rocque's regime is to prosper, we must further emphasise the party's populist appeal, and incentivise membership as a requirement for government positions and contracts."
NFA_republique_sociale:0 "République Sociale"
NFA_republique_sociale_desc:0 "With the Croix-de-Feu stronger than ever, and having gained the support of much of the establishment, de la Rocque can finalyl reform the failed Third Republic into a new République Sociale Française, creating a new French constitution along Catholic and corporatist lines, with the support of the Assmebly and military. Under the Colonel's guidance, France shall prosper like never before."
NFA_a_minimum_wage:0 "A Minimum Wage"
NFA_a_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Despite our good relations with business, we must never forget or ignore the struggles and sacrifices made by ordinary French workers. The working class makes up a substantial proportion of our membership, and any government has a duty, albeit one long neglected by the Republican establishment, to provide for the common man. As such, we should establish a fair and just minimum wage for all French workers, something which our corporate allies can quite easily afford."
NFA_catholic_state_unions:0 "Catholic State Unions"
NFA_catholic_state_unions_desc:0 "The free-market capitalism of previous governments was a divisive and unsustainable system, and only left the working class with much justified resentment, which was taken advantage of by socialists and erupted in the Revolution. We must take care to never let such resentment build up again. As such, the state will assume control of the remaining trade unions, and reorganise them into Catholic organisations, which can represent workers on company boards and ensure just treatment, while also promoting faith and patriotism among their members."
NFA_restore_the_place_of_the_church:0 "Restore the Place of the Church"
NFA_restore_the_place_of_the_church_desc:0 "Ever since 1905, the Republic has had no organised ties with the Catholic Church, and Catholicism in France has come under attack from Republican elites. Although the conservative policies of Pétain's government did go some way to restoring morality, much work remains to be done, and it is de la Rocque, champion of the Catholic middle class, who will do it. It is time to reach out to the Holy See, and sign a new Concordat with the Church."
NFA_bridge_class_divide:0 "Bridge the Class Divide"
NFA_bridge_class_divide_desc:0 "Class divisions and inequality have crippled our nation for too long, leaving hard-working workers embittered against France and vulnerable to leftist subversion, while their elites grow rootless and complacent. The time for such a disasterous state of affairs is no more, and through worker representation on company boards and state oversight of the market, a new era of class collaboration can set in, in which every man knows and accepts his place and purpose."
NFA_expand_the_dispos:0 "Expand the Dispos"
NFA_expand_the_dispos_desc:0 "The dispos have served as paramilitary and security service for the Croix-de-Feu for years now, asserting the party's presence on the streets and protecting our members, without devolving into the same violence and illegality as the AF's Camelots and other organisations. To protect the government and secure our position, we should further promote membership of the dispos among young men, and empower them to act against our rivals."
NFA_le_flambeau:0 "Le Flambeau"
NFA_le_flambeau_desc:0 "Le Flambeau has always been the newspaper of the Croix-de-Feu, and is popular among our membership. However, propaganfa is of little use when read only by those who already support us. As such, we should invest more heavily in Le Flambeau, expanding its journalistic staff and increasing its circulation, to ensure our message reaches the whole population."
NFA_fils_et_filles:0 "Fils et Filles"
NFA_fils_et_filles_desc:0 "The Fils et Filles de Croix de Feu is the youth wing of our party, teaching the children of loyal members exercise, hard work, and faith. Our government will be greatly strengthened in the long term if we expand this organisation, and so we shall strongly encourage government officials, whatever their personal sympathies, to enroll their children in the movement, and greatly increase the organisation's funding."
NFA_votes_for_women:0 "Votes for Women"
NFA_votes_for_women_desc:0 "Female suffrage has long been championed by parties across the French right, with women held to be modest and conscientious enough to likely vote en masse for conservative parties. In order to strengthen the party's hand and further legitimise future electoral successes, we should extend the franchise to women, and meanwhile extend the Croix-de-Feu's own women's organisations, to galvanise support among the new voterbloc."
NFA_legalist_state:0 "Legalist State"
NFA_legalist_state_desc:0 "The duty of the state, above all else, is to maintain social order and the rule of law, keeping all its citizens safe and free. A state which cannot do this is a failed state, and we must not forget it. By further putting into law the emerging corporatist system, and expaning the police, we can maintain capable and orderly governance to prepare France for the liberation."
NFA_encourage_personality_cult:0 "Encourage the Cult of Personality"
NFA_encourage_personality_cult_desc:0 "Colonel de la Rocque's charisma and popularity has caused him to become deeply popular among his commited followers, with his portrait becoming a common sight in the homes and workplaces of Croix-de-Feu loyalists. To further consolidate our government and promote de la Rocque' public image, we should encourage this cult of personality, celebrating his heroism in the Great War and commitment to France."
NFA_entrench_corporatism:0 "Entrench Corporatism"
NFA_entrench_corporatism_desc:0 "With unions brought under state control and represented in government, and with the state brokering positive relations between employers and workers, a new corporate state has finally taken hold in France. We should further formalise this state of affairs with a new corporate charter, signed by business leaders and unionists and passed into law, to ensure that all co-operate for the common good under state supervision."
NFA_social_dabord:0 "Social d'Abord!"
NFA_social_dabord_desc:0 "With corporatism succesfully established, and the mass movement of the Croix-de-Feu stronger than ever, Colonel de la Rocque has succesfully transformed French politics.

With preparations for a restoration well underway, the whole nation can rejoice, for true and ancient governance is about to return."

NFA_compromise_with_the_liberals:0 "A Republican Cabinet"
NFA_compromise_with_the_liberals_desc:0 "With the inevitable corruption and waste of his junta having become undeniable public knowledge, Phillipe Pétain has caved to the pressure of his allies in the Assembly and of much of the business community, and appointed Louis Marin, leader of the Catholic and conservative but thoroughly republican FR, as his new Premier. Marin makes no secret of his intention to restore a civilian-led Republican government, but many believe that this will be an uphill struggle."
NFA_republican_govt:0 "Form a Unity Government"
NFA_republican_govt_desc:0 "For now, Marin is merely Premier of Pétain's "Provisional Military Goverment", and in spite of his goals of republicanisation, the junta is, for now, intact. Of course, this must change, and so Marin must now sit down with the other Republican parties, in spite of all their past differences, and attempt to form a new broad coalition government, capable of restoring Republican institutions and constitutional integrity in anticipation of the Liberation."
NFA_restore_assembly_power:0 "Strenghten the Assembly"
NFA_restore_assembly_power_desc:0 "Ever since 1919, National France has been little more than a Presidential dictatorship under Foch and Pétain. Now, however, we can begin to change this, and restore the legislature to its rightful place as the dominant branch of government. New legislation, made possibele by the Republican parties' renewed co-operation, will strenghten the hand of the Assembly, and restore checks and balances on executive power."
NFA_reassure_the_military:0 "Reassure the Military"
NFA_reassure_the_military_desc:0 "Although we are working to break the military's grip on political power, we nevertheless need their support for the government to stay intact and for there to be any hope of a succesful liberation. As such, we have little choice but to reach out to the military command, and placate their fears about democratisation, while offering the concessions needed to bring them around to the government."
NFA_constitutional_security:0 "Constitutional Guarantees"
NFA_constitutional_security_desc:0 "Neither Pétain nor Foch ever formally suspended the Third Republic's constitution, but it is obvious that their junta has defied all of its democratic principles. It is thus vital to reinforce the checks on executive power and free speech enshrined in the consitution, and push through further legislation in support of the same ideals of liberty."
NFA_republican_traditions:0 "Republican Traditions"
NFA_republican_traditions_desc:0 "Since 1789, French republicanism has gained its own distinct aesthetic and philosophical identity, with many historic celebrations and civic rituals attached to the Republic. In order to restore faith in the parliamentary system, we must breathe new life into the Republican ideal, promoting the romantic art celebrating Republican history and rejuvenating its rituals and ceremonial duties of the Republic's leaders."
NFA_ceremonial_presidency:0 "A Ceremonial Presidency"
NFA_ceremonial_presidency_desc:0 "Ever since Foch seized power in 1919, the executive branch has had a tight grip on French politics, with the legislature and judiciary greatly sidelined. Now, however, with the unity government entrenched and Pétain having largely accepted the Assembly's control over ordinary governance, we can further reduce the role of the President to a ceremonial figurehead, a role for which the popular war hero Pétain is excellent, with his prestige sure to further bolster our support."
NFA_judicial_independence:0 "Judicial Independence"
NFA_judicial_independence_desc:0 "Under the junta, the legal system was frequently used to unjustly persecute the military's political enemies, and courts were frequently intimidated to make rulings favourable to the political circumstances of the regime. This is not healthy or sustainable for a democratic republic, and so we must further enshrine the independence of the judicial branch in law, and reinforce respect for the consitutional clauses intended to provide for it."

NFA_free_petain_prisoners_desc:0 "Over the 17 years it was in power, the junta unjustly arrested many of its political opponents, in spite of their obvious anti-socialism, proven by the fact that they too chose to flee to Algeria. Staunch supporters of democracy, these men are excellent politicians and administrators in waiting for our government, and, having reinforced the independence of the judiciary, we should set about revoking their sentences."
NFA_legislative_empowerment:0 "Parliamentary Empowerment"
NFA_legislative_empowerment_desc:0 "With our economic reforms implemented and Pétain, albeit reluctantly, having accepted a largely ceremonial role aas a unifying figurehead for the government and nation, we can now go a step further, and consolidate power in the Assembly, exercised through the Premier and cabinet. The French Republic will be a parliamentary republic, or it will be no republic at all."
NFA_monetary_reform:0 "Devalue the Franc"
NFA_monetary_reform_desc:0 "Pétain's junta was all too frequently negligent of the economy, at least so long as it was keeping them suppplied with armaments. Of course, this is thoroughly unsustainable, and only a determined program of monetary and financial reform can create an economy capable of fuelling the liberation. There is much debate within the coalition about how to reform the economy, but all sides agree that the Franc must be devalued, and so we can start our reforms on this note."
NFA_reynaud_plan:0 "Plan Reynaud"
NFA_reynaud_plan_desc:0 "Premier Marin has accepted the economic proposals of Paul Reynaud of the Alliance Démocrate. A staunch believer in deregulation and the free market, Reynaud adovcates privatisation, cutting out red tape, and strengthening ties with big business as a vital step to get the economy into shape. We can begin to implement these proposals by returning to the free market the indsutries which Pétain's junta has attempted to manage or supervise."
NFA_end_fourty_hour_week:0 "End the Fourty-Hour Week"
NFA_end_fourty_hour_week_desc:0 "Excessive regulation and intervention in the market will only stifle the private talent and initiative that we need in order to liberate France, something which the business community has sought to warn of for years now. Some of the red tape that business is most opposed to is the legal maximum of fourty hours of work a week, a law that the AD has sought to repeal for some time. With the blessing of Marin and the FR, Reynaud and his allies can finally do away with this worthless legislation."
NFA_free_market:0 "Encourage Private Initiative"
NFA_free_market_desc:0 "It is the initiative and dynamism of the free market, not any amount of incompetent and heavy-handed state intervention, that will get our economy into a fit state for the liberation and enrich the nation. It is time for the state to further step back from economic intervention, ensuring big business's support for democratisation, and also taking more steps to promote values of entrepeneurship and hard work."
NFA_chautemps_plan:0 "Plan Chautemps"
NFA_chautemps_plan_desc:0 "Premier Marin has accepted the economic proposals of Camille Chautemps of the Parti Radical. Coming from a historically left-wing party, which at least formally still claims socialist credentials, Chautemps advocates for the representation of workers and for a welfare state, alongside increased state intervention. We can begin to implement these plans by greatly increasing government spending on social welfare, and widening the net for those who can recieve it."
NFA_nationalise_infrastructure:0 "Nationalise Infrastructure"
NFA_nationalise_infrastructure_desc:0 "We cannot allow the narrow interests of a few wealthy businessmen to obstruct the national interest at this vital time, when we absolutely need high-quality infrastructure to connect our sprawling colonies, in order to stimulate the mobilisation and war effort. As such, as per Chautemps's proposals, the state will assume control over ongoing infrastructure projects, and ownership of the roads and railways that currently link together the colonies."
NFA_worker_representation:0 "Worker Representation"
NFA_worker_representation_desc:0 "The revolution happened because the ordinary French worker was allowed to feel powerless, exploited, and betrayed. If we are to organise a succesful liberation campaign, let alone to regain the loyalty of ordinary Frenchmen, we must enshrine the representation of workers through trusted trade unions, whose representatives will take places on company boards. This will create a succesful spirit of collaboration between social classes, reducing class tensions and also reducing the support for right-wing corporatists."
NFA_economic_mobilisation:0 "Economic Mobilisation"
NFA_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "The main part of our economic reforms have now been pushed through, and so we can turn our attention to the coming war, expanding on our financial intiatives to ready the economy for war. Increased subsidies for arms production and propaganda reminding businessmen of the current war and the need for patriotism will ensure that the business community is prepared for the coming conflict."
NFA_republican_restoration:0 "Republican Rejuvenation"
NFA_republican_restoration_desc:0 "With Pétain haven given up his old dictatorial powers and the parties of the Republic having deepened their spirit of co-operation, popular confidence in democracy and Republicanism is steadily returning, with Marin increasingly seen as a benevolent elder statesman and Pétain's own popularity also helping round up support support for the coalition. The ideals of the Third Republic truly have been rejuvenated, and Marin's government has succeeded in its mission to restore Parliamentarism."
NFA_relax_censorship:0 "Relax Censorship"
NFA_relax_censorship_desc:0 "Under the junta, the press was routinely muzzled in its political coverage and stances, and more often bought off to print favourable stories. Harsh censorhsip laws are still in place, supposedly on the pretext of the State of Emergency, and these are thoroughly incompatibale with our moves towards democratisation. It is time we repeal these measures, and restore freedom to the press and the ordinary man."
NFA_cleanse_corruption:0 "Clean Up Corruption"
NFA_cleanse_corruption_desc:0 "During the junta's grip on politics, many personal friends or family members of government officials got easy access to government posts or subsidies, and more often than not blatant and obviously criminal practicies such as bribery and extortion would be practiced by unscrupulous administrators. We must take measures to investigate and bring to justice these undesirable men, and send a clear message that only merit will bring success in the new government."
NFA_government_of_consensus:0 "A Government of Consensus"
NFA_government_of_consensus_desc:0 "After much time, we have finally succeeded in ending military rule, economic stagnation, and corruption in National France. In spite of their many evident differences, the Republican parties have embraced the spirit of consensus and co-operation, and Pétain's own popularity has done much to buoy our support. We have democratised as much as we can within the colonies, and stand ready to bring true liberty to our brothers across the Mediterranean. Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, pour toujours!"

NFA_liberation_preparation:0 "Prepare for the Liberation"
NFA_liberation_preparation_desc:0 "The situation in Continental Europe is quickly becoming more and more tense, with elections imminent among the Communard traitors, whose relations with the Germans are more tense than ever. There is no point in denying that a conflict even worse than the horrors of the Great War is around the corner, and that conflict will be the only chance we ever get to liberate the Métropole from syndcalist tyranny. As such, we must review our military capabilities, and seek to resolve debates within the Army."
NFA_industrialise_colonies:0 "Industrialise the Colonies"
NFA_industrialise_colonies_desc:0 "Our current industry could never hope to sustain a military campaign across the Métropole. If we are to have any hope of liberating our brothers and sisters, we must rectify this dire situation, and seek to encourage a far greater level of industrial growth across the colonies. Subsidies for new construction projects in both the Maghreb and Sub-Saharan territories will begin to get our industrial capacity back on track."
NFA_entente_trade:0 "Entente Trade Deals"
NFA_entente_trade_desc:0 "The chaos of the revolution and exile left us with precious few allies compared to the vast coalition that had challenged Germany during the Great War. However, we must consolidate our ties with those allies that we do have, and reach out to our fellow Entente nations for increased economic co-operation, with mutually beneficial trade deals and investment, alongside a fresh effort to attract investment from these countries."
NFA_dockyards:0 "Maghrebi Shipbuilding"
NFA_dockyards_desc:0 "Without a strong and well-equipped navy, we have no hope of liberating France, and as such we badly need ships. With this in mind, the government should subsidise shipbuilding on the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa, and invest further in naval research."
NFA_rearmament:0 "National Re-Armament Program"
NFA_rearmament_desc:0 "Our need for military imdustry is greater than ever, and as such it is now vital that we redouble our investments in arms factories and subsidies for armaments, encouraging both private business and state interests to do their bit for the military econoy, and introducing greater rationing in order to save resources for the military."
NFA_plane_subsidies:0 "Subsidise Plane Production"
NFA_plane_subsidies_desc:0 "The Commmunard forces far outnumber our own, and as such we will need domination of the skies in order to push them back, and also to protect our Mediterranean supply lines. As such, we should greatly extend our subsidies for planes, making a great effort to encourage manufacturers to porduce higher quantities of the latest models."
NFA_supply_liberation:0 "Supplying the Liberation"
NFA_supply_liberation_desc:0 "As we push further into the Commune, we will only need more and more equipment to sustain the Liberation Campaign. Hence, the state must go ever further in its investments in the army, securing the safety of our forces' supply lines and the quality and quantity of their equipment. No matter how tightly the economy has already been squeezed, more is always needed."
NFA_build_transsaharian:0 "The Trans-Saharian Railway"
NFA_build_transsaharian_desc:0 "The German takeover of Morocco has left our remaining West African colonies largely cut off from Algiers by the Sahara. This causes an inefficient administration, and if we are ever invaded it will lead to severe supply issues for our soldiers, particularly if we can no longer safely travel around the coast. As such, we must begin the construction of a new railway across the desert."
NFA_colonial_extraction:0 "Colonial Extraction"
NFA_colonial_extraction_desc:0 "Our colonies contain a vast amount of natural wealth, which has so far gone largely untapped. However, we need the trade and investment more than ever, and as such it is now vital that we look to developing and extracting these valuable resources."
NFA_extent_of_conscription:0 "The Extent of Conscription"
NFA_extent_of_conscription_desc:0 "For years nowm, the government has shied away from the question of how far we should go in conscripting natives for military service, hesitant to alter the status quo in either direction to avoid controversy. However, the hour of the liberation is fast approaching, and many would now like to see the matter settled for good."
NFA_native_autonomy:0 "Expand Native Autonomy"
NFA_native_autonomy_desc:0 "With the AF now firmly in power, we can expand on our alliances with far-right native parties such as the Action Algerienne, and ensure the loyalty of traditional native rulers, by giving greater local autonomy to colonial regions, empowering local monarchs ans integralist politicians with much control over day-to-day governance of their own lands."
NFA_status_quo:0 "Colonial Status Quo"
NFA_status_quo_desc:0 "In spite of the complaints from many corners of society, the existing system in our colonies genuinely does work, and is only benefical to us. As such, we should discredit the groups calling for either liberalised or harsher colonial policies, and affirm our support for the Civilising Mission, by further funding Missionaries and reinforcing colonial outposts in the more remote territories."
NFA_colonial_crackdown:0 "Renewed Crackdown"
NFA_colonial_crackdown_desc:0 "The threat posed to our colonial empire, the only land that the true French government has left, is by now too great to ignore. Seditious individuals from across the political spectrum, both native and French, routinely call for reforms to colonial rule, but it is quite the opposite that we need. New waves of arrests, and the establishment of a formal colonial secret police, will eliminate threats to our continued domination."
NFA_french_union:0 "French Union"
NFA_french_union_desc:0 "With the Métropole liberated, the centre of French administration is now across the sea from the colonies. This has caused much administrative chaos, as the colonial administrations seek to get back onto their own two feet, and only new reforms to the colonial system can remedy this. A new "French Union" in which the colonies are nominally equal partners in a united French state will solve this, and appease native demands for self rule."
NFA_pacify_algeria:0 "Reassert French Rule"
NFA_pacify_algeria_desc:0 "Now that the central government resides once more in the métropole, many colonials feel even more cut off from power than before, and are pressing for greater independence, while the relocation of the central administration has lessened our ability to keep independence movements suppressed. The only remedy to this is to authorise new crackdowns against native organisations and nationalist groups, and to send more troops to reinforce colonial garrisons."
NFA_cdg_plan_chosen:0 "The de Gaulle Plan"
NFA_cdg_plan_chosen_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain has accepted Charles de Gaulle's proposals for military reform, with de Gaulle having been appointed as the new Chief of Staff. The French military will now set about implementing de Gaulle's reform plan, centred around the ideal of a small but heavily capable army, with high quality training and equipment, and also concentrated breakthroughs by armoured units."
NFA_elite_army:0 "A Professional Army"
NFA_elite_army_desc:0 "General de Gaulle has long argued that, given the circumstances of our exile, it would be pointless to attempt to raise a large army, and we must instead make the most of what manpower we have. By cutting manpower quotas for the army while shifting funds from recruitment to training, we can create a small but highly professional and well-trained army."
NFA_special_forces:0 "Expand Special Forces"
NFA_special_forces_desc:0 "A major aspect of professionalising the army is a shift towards specialised, elite units, such as marines and mountaineers. Different units will recieve in-depth specialised training, in order to be exceptionally well-suited for specific operations and circumstances. Meanwhile, the establishment of a new Marine program will help our efforts to land in the Métropole, and reduce the influence of the Navy."
NFA_mobile_warfare:0 "Embrace Manoeuvre Warfare"
NFA_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Himself a tank officer, de Gaulle has claimed for years that tanks represent the future of warfare, with the breakthroughs they achieved during the Great War, particularly at the Somme, demonstrating their ability to rapidly smash through enemy lines before the enemy can form a clear response. With tank technology having greatly improved since then, we can expand our armoured units and increase our investments in tank production."
NFA_tank_investments:0 "Chars de Bataille"
NFA_tank_investments_desc:0 "Although strong armoured units are essential to de Gaulle's vision, our own technology and production capacity falls far short of what would be needed to sustain the tank divisions envisaged by the Chief of Staff. As such, we shall redirect funding away from the navy and from recruitment campaigns to support new Research and Development for tanks, and increase subsidies for their production."
NFA_artillery_improvements:0 "Artillery Improvements"
NFA_artillery_improvements_desc:0 "Although tanks are central to de Gaulle's plan, they can only be in one place at one time, and as such capable infantry units are needed to cover a broader front. The Great War showed that strong artillery is the only way to prevent infantry from being bogged down in attrition, and thus we shall expand our artillery units and further develop tactics for the shelling of enemy forces."
NFA_concentrated_breakthrough:0 "Rapid Breakthroughs"
NFA_concentrated_breakthrough_desc:0 "If tank units can punch through enemy lines quickly enough, it is essential that they keep going as far as they can, to quickly secure strategic locations and throw enemy forces into chaos. Our newly expanded armoured units will thus be trained in rapidly breaking past enemy defences, and tank commanders will be instructed in how best to exploit holes in enemy lines."
NFA_officer_autonomy:0 "Strengthen Officer Autonomy"
NFA_officer_autonomy_desc:0 "Provided that he is capable and well-trained, the officer on the ground will be the best judge of how to act in battle, as the failures of Generals away in their Chateaux during the Great War proved. As such, we should ensure that our officers are highly capable and can be trusted to take dynamic action, and empower them to do just that."
NFA_air_support:0 "Air Support"
NFA_air_support_desc:0 "A large air force is needed in order to disrupt enemy supply lines and break up enemy units, something that will greatly assist our armoured breakthroughs. As such, de Gaulle has authorised new funds for the Air Force, which will be encouraged to focus on Close Air Support and dive-bombing tactics, and supported by de Gaulle in exchange for distancing itself from Darlan and the navy."
NFA_armour_advancements:0 "Armour Advancements"
NFA_armour_advancements_desc:0 "Our current tank models continue to fall far behind those needed for de Gaulle's swift offensives, and although his theories are widely accepted, many officers still lack the experience to command tanks in battle. Thus, we shall invest further in the development of new tank models, and give far more officers extensive training in aromured warfare."
NFA_subordinate_navy:0 "Subordinate the Navy"
NFA_subordinate_navy_desc:0 "In the current circumstances, we have little need for a colossal navy capable of dominating large oceans, when all we need is to be able to cross the Mediterranean sea. So far, however, the nacy has refused to acknowledge this, with Admiral Darnand still demanding needless funds for his worthless projects. It is time to put the navy in its place, and ensure that it cannot act without the approval of the Chief of Staff."
NFA_darlan_plan_chosen:0 "The Darlan Plan"
NFA_darlan_plan_chosen_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain has accepted François Darlan's proposals for military reform, with Darlan having been appointed as the new Chief of Staff. The French military will now set about implementing Darlan's reform plan, centred around the ideal of as large an army as circumstances allow, within an integrated command structure that allows for greater co-operation between forces."
NFA_military_research:0 "Military Research"
NFA_military_research_desc:0 "Our current Research and Development capablities are severely lacking, and we need to greatly expand funding for research facilities in order to develop the military technology required for a modern army. We can put off resolving this issue for no longer, and it is time to greatly increase funding for military research."
NFA_large_army:0 "A Large Army"
NFA_large_army_desc:0 "Darlan and Weygand believe strongly that the only way we can truly ensure a strong enough military is to embrace the traditional French doctrine of an expansive army, capable of covering, and pushing across, a broad front. As such, the General Staff has organised new recruitment campaigns among white Frenchmen, and an effort to persuade those Frenchmen who have fled to other countries to come here and do their duty as well."
NFA_contact_resistance:0 "Expand Resistance Contacts"
NFA_contact_resistance_desc:0 "Within the Métropole, the Communards are still far from unanimously accepted, especially in traditionally Catholic rural areas. Sizeable resistance movements still persist in parts of the Commune, and although we have always tried to support them it has so far proved insufficient to make much difference to their plight. Now, however, Darlan has committed to deepen our backing of these valiant men, ordering numerous more agents to be sent to the Commune, who can co-ordinate the operations of Resistance Groups and ensure they answer to Algiers."
NFA_force_cooperation:0 "Force Co-Operation"
NFA_force_cooperation_desc:0 "Without a strong navy and airforce, we have no hope of ever crossing the Mediterranean, let alone of maintaining the pressure on Communard supply lines that would be needed to defeat them. As such, Darlan and Weygand have committed to further integrate the commands of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, ensuring that the French military is one united and cohesive force, and reigning in ambitious generals such as de Gaulle."
NFA_coordinate_operations:0 "Co-Ordinate Operations"
NFA_coordinate_operations_desc:0 "Without the three branches of the military acting in unison, we have little hope of managing a well-organised campaign. As such, the Officer Corps of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will be integrated together, and we shall ensure that officers from one branch must consult with their counterparts from the others, and arrange any necessary supporting operations, before making new plans."
NFA_naval_influence:0 "Strengthen the Navy"
NFA_naval_influence_desc:0 "If anything, the Navy is the force we need the most in our current situation, as without it we have no hope of even landing in the Commune. Darlan, himself an Admiral, knows this all too well, with many of his loyalists also coming from the Navy. As such, it is vital that we increase funding for the Navy and increase the representation of naval officers in the General Staff."
NFA_air_power:0 "Rule the Skies"
NFA_air_power_desc:0 "A strong Air Force is absolutely vital, in order to both cover our fleets in the Mediterranean and support soldiers in the Métropole. Thus it is vital that we further extend our investments in the Air Force, subsidising Research and Development of planes and promising its chief officers continued backing in exchange for supporting Darlan."
NFA_patriotic_appeals:0 "Patriotic Appeals"
NFA_patriotic_appeals_desc:0 "As we seek to attract more recruits for Darlan's envisaged larger army, it is vital that we appeal to the common patriotism of every decent Frenchman, reminding the people at every opportunity that their French brothers and sisters are subjected to socialist tyranny, with their faith and culture suppressed. Only a new crusade to free France can change this, one which requires the commitment of every citizen."
NFA_broad_offensives:0 "Broad Offensives"
NFA_broad_offensives_desc:0 "Only by pushing across a large front can we maintain pressure on the Communards, something we can do better than ever with our wealth of new recruitments. We must ensure that our infantry forces understand what is needed to maintain a large offensive, and that our officers are well-trained in commanding such operations."
NFA_citizen_soldier:0 "Citizen-Soldier Ideal"
NFA_citizen_soldier_desc:0 "For centuries, the tradition of the Citizen-Soldier, the common Frenchman called to war in times of need, has been crucial to our military prowess. This ideal underpins Darlan's expansion of troop numbers, and we should further reinforce it through mandatory infantry training for all able-bodied adult men, so that if needs must they can be called to serve their nation in its hour of need."
NFA_dominate_mediterranean:0 "Dominate the Mediterranean"
NFA_dominate_mediterranean_desc:0 "Without mastery of the Mediterranean, any effort to transport forces to the shores of the Métropole would be entirely futile. Furthermore, if we can achieve genuine naval control over the sea, we can secure new trade routes while disrupting Communard supplies, and garner new prestige within the region. As such, it is crucial that we invest further in shipbuilding and naval research."

NFA_Ministry_of_the_Air:0 "Ministry of the Air"
NFA_Ministry_of_the_Air_desc:0 "The Ministry of the Air is tasked with both organising our aeronautical efforts, such as civilian air transport, and our air forces, which proved so useful in the Great War and which according to our military thinkers will prove even more critical in the coming war, as technological progress enables new air tactics and strategy."
NFA_Total_Air_War:0 "Total Air War"
NFA_Total_Air_War_desc:0 "Many of the younger generation of officers argue for large scale use of air support for the infantry, but others have also suggested that we should not shy away from using our air force to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry in a more generalised manner: we are not in a position to avoid total war, and turning the enemies' ressources to rubble can only help us."
NFA_Air_Coordination_Center:0 "Air Coordination Center"
NFA_Air_Coordination_Center_desc:0 "We will create a dedicated command center for our air forces, so that they are best assigned according to their strength and weaknesses instead of letting them be potentially misused by commanders with less experience of air tactics, and to ensure that the status of our forces in the air be monitored and controlled as best as possible, for example to mount rescue missions."
NFA_DEM_Barrage:0 "D.E.M Barrage"
NFA_DEM_Barrage_desc:0 "To coordinate offensive and defensive efforts in the air, the ministry will generalise the use of Electromagnetic Detection, immense antennas placed in strategic points using electromagnetic waves to detect aircrafts."
NFA_DCA_Network:0 "DCA Network"
NFA_DCA_Network_desc:0 "To prevent any air forces from attacking us on our own soil, particularly in Corsica so close to the red mainland, we will develop a network of anti-aircraft artillery batteries and searchlights,  highly coordinated by the Ministry of the Air."
NFA_Aircraft_Production:0 "Aircraft Production"
NFA_Aircraft_Production_desc:0 "The aircraft industry exploded during the Weltkrieg, and the government has made sure to generously subsidize it to facilitate its implementation in Algeria. Since then preparations for the next war have not stopped, especially since colonial conflicts have given us the opportunity to test our aircrafts. With war finally on the horizon, we will mobilise the industry to the fullest."
NFA_Long_Range_Fighter:0 "Long Range Fighter"
NFA_Long_Range_Fighter_desc:0 "Corsica might be a floating airfield from which our planes can easily reach the mainland, but we nevertheless need fighters capable of patrolling the vast expanses of the Mediterreanean as well as escort our bombers deep into red territory to destroy the Commune’s industry. The Ministry will ensure that the development of heavy fighters is not neglected."
NFA_Tactical_Bombers:0 "Tactical Bombers"
NFA_Tactical_Bombers_desc:0 "Our military thinkers have realised the importance of coordinated air-land efforts, with infantry heavily supported by tactical air support, against defensive structures, enemy personnel or infrastructure. To implement these tactics, the Ministry of the Air will support the development of tactical bombers."
NFA_Transmitting_Knowledge:0 "Transmitting Knowledge"
NFA_Transmitting_Knowledge_desc:0 "France has a proud history in aeronautics, and the Weltkrieg produced many heroes of the air. But you can’t learn to fly on the ground, and pilots are a rare commodity: we’ll ensure our best aces become even better instructors and teach a younger generation how to exceed them."
NFA_New_Air_Tactics:0 "New Air Tactics"
NFA_New_Air_Tactics_desc:0 "The field of military aviation is a rapidly changing one, and our pilots must adapt their skills to ever changing technology: with new aircrafts come new possibilities of offensive and defensive manoeuvres, new ways of coming out of a tense dogfight: extensive training in these new tactical advances will give an edge over our enemies."
NFA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs:0 "Ministry of Naval Affairs"
NFA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs_desc:0 "The Ministry of Naval Affairs, once tasked with overseeing the administration of both our colonies and our naval forces, is now solely dedicated to the needs of the Navy: control of Mediterrean will be essential to retake the Métropole, as such the ministry will make sure that our navy can stand up to the Internationale."
NFA_A_World_Class_Navy:0 "A World-Class Navy"
NFA_A_World_Class_Navy_desc:0 "Most of the French navy accompanied our government in exile to North Africa, as such our navy is large but many of our ships are outdated. In its current state the navy could defend our shores, but it is uncertain how it would fare if someone were to attempt to contest our hold on the Western Mediterrenean. We will strive for a large scale overhaul."
NFA_An_African_Toulon:0 "An African Toulon"
NFA_An_African_Toulon_desc:0 "Toulon was the primary base of the Mediterrean fleet before the war, but since the exile it has been stationed on lake Bizerte, a large laguna in northern Tunisia intensively developed by colonial authorities, with in particular a large arsenal in Ferryville. To meet our ambitions, Bizerte will be overhauled and developed further."
NFA_Heavy_Destroyers:0 "Heavy Destroyers"
NFA_Heavy_Destroyers_desc:0 "France’s navy has always been developed with the assumption that it would fight a superior force. In the last century, a movement called the “Jeune École” advocated for the use of many smaller ships instead of large dreadnoughts: this idea is now outdated. The ministry will instead encourage the development of well-armed destroyers, a middle ground between our traditional doctrines and the international trends."
NFA_Aviation_Cruisers:0 "Aviation Cruisers"
NFA_Aviation_Cruisers_desc:0 "The field of naval aviation has been somewhat left behind by the international community, locked in a permanent arms race: this is a race we could not win, instead we will radically change our doctrine and encourage the use of air power in naval warfare, for reconnaissance and precision strikes."
NFA_Sea_Leviathans:0 "Sea Leviathans"
NFA_Sea_Leviathans_desc:0 "We might not be able to compete with Germany or Japan in the naval arms race, but we certainly can attempt to knock out any of our Mediterrean opponents with well armed heavy battleships: this might go against previous doctrines, but our current situation means it is time for some innovation."
NFA_Air_Carriers:0 "Air Carriers"
NFA_Air_Carriers_desc:0 "The current naval arms race is misguided: by developing aircraft carriers, we will ensure that we can keep control over the Meditterean by bombing our enemies and sinking them to the depths of the sea before we are even within range of their guns."
NFA_Preparing_Our_Return:0 "Preparing Our Return"
NFA_Preparing_Our_Return_desc:0 "To reconquer the métropole, we need to land on its shore, a fight that the Commune has been expecting for two decennies: it will be anything but simple. We must prepare as much as we can, as there will be no second chance. The Ministry will invest in the development of anything that could help our amphibious assault."
NFA_Invasion_Logistics:0 "Invasion Logistics"
NFA_Invasion_Logistics_desc:0 "However, the amphibious assault is merely the first part, we must ensure that our troops can secure a lasting bridgehead. And for this, there is only one way to prepare: impeccable logistics, so that the men lucky enough to be the first to set foot on the sacred soil of the Patrie can hold back any counterattack the Communards might attempt."
NFA_The_U_Boat_Menace:0 "Develop the Forces Sous-Marines"
NFA_The_U_Boat_Menace_desc:0 "The Commune lacks many resources essential to the modern war effort, most importantly, oil. Keeping control of the Mediterranean will be a strong step towards isolating them from their allies or neutral states willing to trade with them, but a large fleet of submarines will give us the capacity to harass their convoys even more efficiently."
NFA_Battaile_Escadres:0 "Bataille d'Escadres"
NFA_Battaile_Escadres_desc:0 "The battle for the Mediterranean won’t be won with a single engagement, and we need to think strategically. By creating task forces, we will ensure our ships have clear roles and that they will be easily more coordinated, and our naval commanders will be taught how to think on a larger scale."

NFA_cull_freemasonary_desc:0 "The pagan secret society that is Freemasonary has long sought to infiltrate French institutions and abuse them for their own designs, fatally weakening us during both the war and the Revolution. Now we can take back what is ours by removing enemies of the French Legion associated with the Freemason movement before they strike us."
NFA_voice_of_the_militia:0 "Voice of the Militia"
NFA_voice_of_the_militia_desc:0 "The French Militias requires both more recruits and more devotion.

NFA_dominate_capitalism:0 "Dominate Capitalism"
NFA_dominate_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalist internationalism, materialism and greed have long sought to subvert our nation, our faith and our unity.

They and the army shall all be merged into one as commanders from each League are brought to heel under Darnard, organized as a single cohesive unit simply called the French Militia, with Commanders promised prominence after the Liberation for their loyalty. Only some organizations will remain semi-independent but underneath the Milice for internal security purposes, such as Darnard's Knights of the Sword."

NFA_ideal_of_youth_desc:0 "Strength. Vitality. Action. The positive attributes of youth are not to be understated, and as such Militia Schooling with an emphasis on recruiting young men and upholding the ideal of physical fitness shall be implemented at once."
NFA_ultranational_catholicism:0 "Ultranational Catholicism"
NFA_ultranational_catholicism_desc:0 "The values of France are those of an uncompromising Christian faith that warriors do not shy away from if they are to wage a war on the chaos and radical materialism destroying this earth. We must embrace our own national Catholicism and the French Race as incontrovertibly linked, promoting Legion friendly priests within the Church and demanding an endorsement of our values from the Papacy alongside according funds. They MUST denounce those supposed Christians who helped destroy true Catholicism in France such as the liberal Austrian scum who must now be called into a Crusade against our foes unless they wish to be destroyed next."
NFA_french_purity:0 "French Purity"
NFA_french_purity_desc:0 "France is not simply a place but a people, a people resulting from thousands of years of blood and tradition. This can not be forgotten as French blood purity will be rewarded and promoted within society and those who subvert it such as Jews and 'natives' and worst of them all, those who breed with foreigners, will be treated accordingly."
NFA_underworld_connections:0 "Underworld Connections"
NFA_underworld_connections_desc:0 "In Nice and Corsica there remain members of the Milieu who oppose the syndicalist revolution and who remain on good terms with Darnard's Legion. The Praetorians will tigthen connections with them for men, supplies and most importantly information."
NFA_knightly_rituals:0 "Knightly Rituals"
NFA_knightly_rituals_desc:0 "We are the French Knights of old reborn, sent to make France whole again, as we should act as such. Tightly regulated knightly rituals, ceremonies and initiation rituals will increase our prestige and loyalty from loyal soldiers."
NFA_legionary_outreach:0 "Legionary Outreach"
NFA_legionary_outreach_desc:0 "We are not alone in desiring a world free of madness and a return to spiritualism and a rightfully earned warrior hierarchy despite our current disagreement over the details. Both Evola and the Iron Guard have endorsed our 'Esoteric' and traditionalist turn, and as such we should reach out to them and like-minded allies in Spain."
NFA_the_internal_enemy:0 "The Internal Enemy"
NFA_the_internal_enemy_desc:0 "Even in our fort of French nationalism, the internal enemy waits to strike. The Jews, liberals, unruly capitaists, even the supposedly conservative critics of our Order, must be purged if we are to avoid further sabotage and espionage. We shall not repeat the mistakes of the first World War by allowing them to run rampant, and we must be pure if we are to redeem the mainland."
NFA_militia_corporatism:0 "Militia Corporatism"
NFA_militia_corporatism_desc:0 "It is time to further tighten our grip of the market, the market has done its time and has its merits, unfortunately, the capitalists only think of getting rich at the expense of their country, their blood brothers and the national cause. Under Darnand this is no longer the case, the market will be monitored and controlled by our proud legionnaires, the brave sons of the Eternal France, because they are the most able to serve it."
NFA_grand_master:0 "The Grand Master"
NFA_grand_master_desc:0 "We must end this charade of failed defender of France, Petain, being our leader when we have but one Chief of the French, Joseph Darnard. Petain will be respectfully retired and The Grand Master of the Milice shall be granted vastly expanded executive power."
NFA_total_sacrifice:0 "Total Sacrifice"
NFA_total_sacrifice_desc:0 "Passive support for the cause will not do, if we are to take back our homeland the citizenry must give all. Every man who can serve or produce must, every women who can serve in an auxillary shall, every gun and vehicle that goes underused must be the Militias. We will not lose for want of manpower or resources, we will squeeze this colony of every drop of blood and sweat."
NFA_industrial_push_command:0 "Industrial Push Command"
NFA_industrial_push_command_desc:0 "Now that we have submitted the market to our will it is time to use it wisely. Great works, as much in the civil and military field as in the naval field, will be undertaken by the Great Master in order to transform our overseas possessions into industrialized territories worthy of our Metropole occupied by the Communards."
NFA_colonial_pacification:0 "Colonial Pacification"
NFA_colonial_pacification_desc:0 "As is Paris, Marseille, Strasbourg or Brest, our once vast colonial empire is an integral part of our great country, our forefathers having fought valiantly under the tricolor flag to earn these resourceful lands. The natives don't seem to understand this reality, they are here in our country, not in theirs, on our French lands, it's time to remind them of this fundamental lesson and to make sure they get it in their heads once and for all, one way or another..."

NFA_the_beautiful_war_desc:0 "We are ready, after long and costly preparations that have required a lot of hard work from our Grand Master Joseph Darnand, everything is ready to launch the crusade that will bring us home. The Communard dogs will defend themselves, but our proud and strong legionnaires will beat them just as we crushed the Reds of the Paris Commune in 1870. Onward! The only true French will triumph!"

###Reconstruction###
NFA_la_liberation:0 "La Libération"
NFA_la_liberation_desc:0 "After so many long years of pain and struggle in the name of French freedom, we have finally returned to the mainland, freeing our brothers from the tyranny of socialism. Our beautiful country, however, lies in ruins, devastated by the worst war in its history, and the return to the métropole after years of exile has caused chaos within our administration. Remedying these many issues will be no mean feat."
NFA_settle_returnees:0 "Settle Returnees"
NFA_settle_returnees_desc:0 "With the métropole back in our hands, there are now millions of Frenchmen seeking to, as they see it, come home. These men and women not only expect settlement and a resumption of life as it was before the revolution, but also a restoration of their old properties. Of course, fully meeting these demands would generate much resentment against the Frenchmen who never left the métropole, whose loyalty we need to gain."
NFA_restore_admin:0 "Restore Administration"
NFA_restore_admin_desc:0 "The move from Algiers to [NFA.Capital.GetName] has greatly impacted the efficiency of our administration, with bureaucrats having to forget twenty years of established practice. Meanwhile, this has been cruelly exploited by what socialist resistance remains, with civil disorder now all too common. We must work to reduce the impacts of this situation, investing in new bureaucratic training and offices, and re-inforcing pollice forces."
NFA_adress_devastation:0 "Adress Devastation"
NFA_adress_devastation_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the war and the horrendous battles required at every step to free the nation, much of France now lies in ruins. The pre-war socialist economy has collapsed, with countless millions not only jobless but without any jobs to seek, with their former factories and farms having been torn to pieces. As such, we must urgently invest in relief for the people, and begin rebuilding the country."
NFA_rebuild_industry:0 "Rebuild Industry"
NFA_rebuild_industry_desc:0 "If the economy is ever to recover from the horrific damage done by the war, we must rebuild the hundreds of factories turned to rubble by bombs and shells. New government agencies, and millions of Francs of funds, will ensure that ruined industrial complexes can be rebuilt, using labour programs that can put those impoverished by the war back on track to prosperity."
NFA_national_effort:0 "Effort National"
NFA_national_effort_desc:0 "The reconstruction of the nation and economy will require the dedication of every loyal Frenchman, regardless of politics or former allegiances. A new government program, dubbed the "Effort National" will ensure that every working man knows that the rebuilding of the nation, and acceptance of the new government, is the only rational choice for his own family and the community around him. Meanwhile, it is time for the state to further invest into the salvaging of industry, and economic relief."
NFA_assert_legitimacy:0 "Assert Legitimacy"
NFA_assert_legitimacy_desc:0 "There can no longer be any doubt that we alone are capable of governing France. Socialism is broken across the world, and the strength of the socialist resistance within France is rapidly declining. New propaganda campaigns and investments in law and order will ensure that every citizen respects us as his nation's sole legitimate government."
NFA_syndie_trials:0 "Trials of the Communards"
NFA_syndie_trials_desc:0 "With the greater part of the Commune's leadership now safely imprisoned, we can arrange for them to stand trial for their crimes against France and its people. However, the matter of sentencing these men may well prove controversial, and the government will need to tread carefully in the coming weeks."
NFA_reconstruction_over:0 "National Recovery"
NFA_reconstruction_over_desc:0 "Although much remains to be done, the worst of the post-war devastation is now behind us, with the French economy having stabilised and jobs returned to the country. Meanwhile, although some dissent and resistance lingers, the political scene has calmed down, with our government secure in its place and broadly accepted, if not universally loved. The worst is behind us, and now France can face the future."

NFA_la_france_divisible:0 "La France Divisible"
NFA_la_france_divisible_desc:0 "Despite our succesful liberation of parts of France, much of the nation is now occupied under the boot of Germany. Of course, this state of affairs is completely intolerable, and it is an urgent priority that we seek a remedy to it, assessing our options for how to win back our land."
NFA_send_ultimatum:0 "German Ultimatum"
NFA_send_ultimatum_desc:0 "Only a show of force will put the boches in their place. With the French army having mobilised to the current frontiers, we can disptach a blatant ultimatum to the German government: fall back to the pre-war borders, or face the full might of a resurgent French nation."
NFA_bordeaux_conference:0 "The Bordeaux Conference"
NFA_bordeaux_conference_desc:0 "We must face the reality that a war with Germany would be catastrophic and unwinnable at this stage. As such, our diplomatic corps has drawn up a proposal for a new coference with the Germans, to be held in Bordeaux, where we shall try to negotiate for the return of our lands."
NFA_bide_time:0 "Bide Our Time"
NFA_bide_time_desc:0 "The French government has decided that, in the current circumstances, a war with Germany would be madness, but given the extent of Germany's advantage over us negotiations would also be doomed to fail. As such, we can do little but accept the current borders and seek to rebuild ourselves to a point where we can challenge German hegemony in future."
NFA_france_is_whole:0 "French Re-Unification"
NFA_france_is_whole_desc:0 "Thankfully, our gambit has paid off, and France is a united nation once again, from the Pyrenees to the Channell and from the Atlantic to the Alps. This is a vital success for the government, and we can now look further afield in our foreign policy."
NFA_support_resistance:0 "Support the Maquisards"
NFA_support_resistance_desc:0 "Luckily, a loose resistance against the Germans' pawns, known as the Maquisards, has emerged, hoping to drive out the boches and restore our rightful rule. Although we are clearly not ready for direct conflict, funding these heroes is very much in our interests."
NFA_review_economy:0 "Review the Economy"
NFA_review_economy_desc:0 "With the worst of the post-war chaos behind us, we can now direct more funding towards French industry, and set up new government bodies tasked with revitalising France's economy, in order to negate the long-term aftermath of the war and build up economic soft power."
NFA_revive_cities:0 "Revive French Cities"
NFA_revive_cities_desc:0 "Urban areas, and urban industry, are absolutely essential to our economic success, and were hit extremely hard by the war. A new round of investments, aimed at restoring businesses and jobs to cities, and rebuilding the many buildings which are still damaged, will ensure that French cities become the centres of culture and success that they should be."
NFA_new_trade:0 "New Trade Deals"
NFA_new_trade_desc:0 "We cannot achieve economic success without strong trading partners, and finding such trading partners will go a long way to buoying our status on the world stage. Thus, a new government committee will seek to draw up trade deals with nations around the world, and negotiate with them for mutually beneficial arrangements."
NFA_post_syndie_boom:0 "Post-Syndicalist Boom"
NFA_post_syndie_boom_desc:0 "Finally, the economy is back on its feet. The markets have more energy than ever, and France is fast becoming one of the most lucrative places in the world to do business, as companies around the world find favourable opportunities in our country through trade deals and native French businesses become widely respected and wealthy once again. Truly, the French Miracle has arrived."
NFA_french_shipyards:0 "French Shipyards"
NFA_french_shipyards_desc:0 "Before 1914, France was a world leader in shipbuilding, and as the economy grows at an unprecedented pace, we should look to revive this industry, both to sustain the current rate of growth and give France the maritime prowess required to truly claim the status of a great power."
NFA_global_economic_power:0 "Global Economic Power"
NFA_global_economic_power_desc:0 "As our Committee for World Trade negotiates more and more succesful deals, and our economic interests in foreign countries across the world greatly increase, we can now declare ourselves a true world economic power, a force to be reckoned with in world trade and a nation more than capable of exerting financial influence on foreign states."
NFA_review_military:0 "Review the Military"
NFA_review_military_desc:0 "In the immediate aftermath of the Liberation, the French military went into some decline as funds were re-directed to reconstruction, and many soldiers were lost in the course of the War.Now that France is back on its feet, however, we can again increase military funding, beginning with investments in tactical advancement and an expansion of the officer corps."
NFA_syndie_soldier_question:0 "The Fate of Communard Soldiers"
NFA_syndie_soldier_question_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Communard regime, the common soldiers that served in its army have been in a state of legal limbo, something that would be completely unsustainable if allowed to continue for long. Thus, we must finally settle on our policy towards these men, though whatever decision we reach is sure to be controversial."
NFA_honour_heroes:0 "Honour Heroes"
NFA_honour_heroes_desc:0 "The men who fought for France in the Liberation are the greatest heroes that this nation has known in modern times, and must be recognised as such. A new program of veterans' benefits and a cultural effort to recognise their heroism will ensure that the sacrifices that have been made for France are rewarded."
NFA_new_army:0 "Restore Military Prestige"
NFA_new_army_desc:0 "The French military showed what it's made of in the Liberation, and it is vital that foreign powers do not percieve it as having declined since. New military exercises, and a further expanded military budget, will ensure that our newfound repuation for military prowess stays intact."
NFA_expand_deuxieme_bureau:0 "Expand the Deuxième Bureau"
NFA_expand_deuxieme_bureau_desc:0 "In future, countries will compete less and less on the battlefield, and instead will compete for information and intelligence. We must keep up with this emerging trend, and commission new funding for the Deuxième Bureau, alongside a recruitment effort and greater research and innovation regarding espionage methods."
NFA_nuke_research:0 "Nuclear Research"
NFA_nuke_research_desc:0 "Countries across the world are now seeking to develop nuclear bombs, capable of destroying entire cities through the splitting of the atom. Some worry that these will be the end of humanity, but many optimists argue that if weapons become this dangerous then countries will do more to avoid conflict. Either way, for the security of France, and in order to deter any attack, we must look to developing nuclear weapons of our own."
NFA_loose_ends:0 "Loose Ends"
NFA_loose_ends_desc:0 "Whatever the status of Alsace-Lorraine, there are many smaller diplomatic questions, and other territorial disputes, that we should seek to resolve as we assert our place on the world stage. Meanwhile, we can begin to rebuild our colonial empire by demanding that breakaway states submit to our protection."
NFA_consolidate_alliances:0 "Consolidate Alliances"
NFA_consolidate_alliances_desc:0 "Without our various allies around the world, we would have achieved nothing. As such, we must repay their sacrifices with favourable trade terms and military aid, thus guaranteeing that their loyalty to us continues, and we go arm in arm into the new era."
NFA_look_east:0 "Look East"
NFA_look_east_desc:0 "The greatest diplomatic question now facing us is that of Germany, with the perfidious Boches continuing to occupy Alsace-Lorraine, besides many former French colonies stolen in our moment of weakness. It is essential that we determine our policy towards the Reich, as we seek to carve out our place among the great powers."
NFA_german_thaw:0 "German Thaw"
NFA_german_thaw_desc:0 "We have to confront the sorry truth that an effort to destroy the German Empire would be wishful thinking. Their military and economy still outranks ours by miles, and likely always will. As such, the best we can do is attempt to co-operate, and reap what benefits we can. We cab start by proposing the establishment of embassies in each other's capitals, for the first time since 1914."
NFA_reich_trade:0 "Trade With the Reich"
NFA_reich_trade_desc:0 "With Germany having accepted our initial advances, we can now reach out further, and propose a mutually beneficial trade deal, which would see the free exchange of resources and goods across the border. This would go a very long way to warming relations, and also make the status of Alsace-Lorraine less controversial, as it will be far less cut off from France and French investment."
NFA_demilitarise_border:0 "Propose Non-Interference"
NFA_demilitarise_border_desc:0 "So far, Germany has welcomed our efforts at reconciliation. With this in mind, we shall now propose to the Germans that our two countries sign a formal treaty of non-interference, recognising each other's current borders and agreeing spheres of influence around the world which the other country will not meddle in. If the Germans accept, it will be an unprecedented victory for peace, but the amount of concessions they are willing to make may be running thin."
NFA_perennial_enemy:0 "The Perennial Enemy"
NFA_perennial_enemy_desc:0 "The filthy Boches are irredeemable enemies of the French people. We can never commit the atrocities that they committed against innocent Frenchmen in two world wars, whether or not these were under the thin veil of anti-socialism, and we can never forget the plight of our brothers and sisters in Alsace-Lorraine. New military exercies on the border, and heightened aggressive rhetoric, will give the Hun a warning they have coming."
NFA_colonial_claims:0 "Assert Our Colonial Claims"
NFA_colonial_claims_desc:0 "In the chaos of our defeat and revolution, Germany was able to sieze legitimate French territories across the globe. With Franco-German relations once again deteriorating, we should re-assert our claims to these colonies, encouraging unrest among the remaining French settlers and garnering more legitimacy for our anti-German stance."
NFA_alsace_lorraine:0 "A New Alsace Ultimatum"
NFA_alsace_lorraine_desc:0 "No more can we ignore the suffering under Hunnic tyranny of our French brothers and sisters in Alsace-Lorraine, as the humiliation of 1870 remains an unhealed wound in the French national consciousness. The time has come to dispatch a new ultimatum to the German filth: cede our rightful lands, or face the wrath of a resurgent French nation."
NFA_arms_length:0 "At Arm's Length"
NFA_arms_length_desc:0 "There will be no war with Germany, by now that is certain. However there will be no peace either. The deep ancestral rivalry between our two nations cannot simply vanish, and we have little choice but to uneasily compete for influence around the world, while the question of Alsace-Lorraine goes unsolved for yet another generation."
NFA_new_peace:0 "A New Era of Peace"
NFA_new_peace_desc:0 "Against all odds, Germany has accepted our proposal of a non-interference treaty, and the document has now been signed, stipulating spheres of influence and enshrining a promise of non-aggression. [NFA.GetLeader] has declared that the developments indicate "peace in our time", a sentiment with which much of the world seems to agree, as war and all its horrors are truly averted."
NFA_crush_boches:0 "Crush the Boches"
NFA_crush_boches_desc:0 "Finally, the French nation will have its revenge. Every noble Frenchman who fought and died, seemingly in vain, in 1870 and in 1914 will be avenged by the conquering armies of France, as we march East to destroy the Hunnic filth for good. All for one, and one for all!"

###Post-lib Junta###
NFA_triomphe_du_marechal:0 "Triomphe du Maréchal"
NFA_triomphe_du_marechal_desc:0 "After many long years of exile, Maréchal Pétain has finally won the day, and triumphed over the Red traitors. Some years ago, it seemed inevitable that the military junta would whither away, but without its impressive survival we would never have gotten to this triumphant point."
NFA_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
NFA_martial_law_desc:0 "Although the Martial Law declared in 1936 was never formally lifted, it came to be all too lightly enforced, particularly among white Frenchmen and the more trusted natives. With the situation still unstable and chaotic across the newly-liberated Metropolitan territories, we must restore our commitment to national security, and ensure that traitors are correctly dealt with."
NFA_eliminate_socialists:0 "Eliminate Socialists"
NFA_eliminate_socialists_desc:0 "Socialist resistance and subversion remains rife in spite of our victory. Not only are the frequent terror attacks and ambushes on our troops the doing of Communard remnants, but the regrettable difficulties encountered by our administration are likely also the doing of socialist inflitrators and sympathisers. Waves of arrests of those whose loyalty is suspect, and greater investment in the police and security services, will guard against the red menace."
NFA_protect_veterans:0 "Reward Veterans"
NFA_protect_veterans_desc:0 "There is no section of soceity more deserving of the nation's respect and gratitude than the heroes who risked their lives for France to be set free. The veterans of the Liberation campaign, especially career soldiers, are among Pétain's most loyal supporters, and extolling the heroism of common soldiers will inevitably legitimise our military government. An extended program of military benefits, and propaganda to portray veterans as the greatest heroes of France, will go a long way to strengthening our hand."
NFA_cdg_govt:0 "The de Gaulle Government"
NFA_cdg_govt_desc:0 "Following the retirement of our leader, Philippe Pétain, his protégé and Premier, Charles de Gaulle has succeeded him as President and leader of the military junta. The young general must now deal with the remaining resistance, including his rivals within the military, and settle the renewed question of monarchism, a cause with which he has been known to sympathise."
NFA_break_parliamentarism:0 "Break Parliamentary Weakness"
NFA_break_parliamentarism_desc:0 "For too long, the lingering influence of civilian politicians and the parliamentary establishment has divided the nation and undermined its true leaders, the military. Only a President given free reign to defend the nation's interests, as Pétain should have been years ago, can truly serve the people. As such, we must eliminate the influence of liberal politicians and push through new legislation to give de Gaulle greater prerogatives to lead the French nation onwards."
NFA_central_economic_planning:0 "Central Economic Planning"
NFA_central_economic_planning_desc:0 "A central executive is necessary not just to ensure stability and order, but also to defend the interests of the people, not least in financial affairs. A planned economy, regulated from [NFA.Capital.GetName] for the collective good, is necessary, with the market held in check and forced to serve the interests of the public, to ensure collaboration between classes."
NFA_taste_of_equality:0 "A Taste of Equality"
NFA_taste_of_equality_desc:0 "If we are to avoid future class conflicts and defuse red subversion, we must make the people feel that their needs will be served and defended under our own government, which can improve their life and promote their interests. Greater provision for employment programs and social security will ensure the contentment and loyalty of the common man."
NFA_strike_at_dissident_officers:0 "Strike at Dissident Officers"
NFA_strike_at_dissident_officers_desc:0 "There are many military leaders still lurking in the background whose loyalty to de Gaulle is far from assured, such as Maxime Weygand, with whom he has often clashed on military doctrine, and François Darlan, his longstanding rival within the junta. These men are imminent threats to our hold on power, and must be dealt with, whatever the cost."
NFA_purity_of_joan_of_arc:0 "The Purity of Jeanne d'Arc"
NFA_purity_of_joan_of_arc_desc:0 "Saint Jeanne d'Arc, the peasant girl who nobly came to the defence of the nation in the Hundred Years' War, is the perfect ideal for the French people to aspire. Pious, patriotic, and valiant, every citizen should aspire to emulate her virtues. New education and cultural programmes will ensure that these principles are central to our culture."
NFA_presidential_state:0 "Presidential State"
NFA_presidential_state_desc:0 "Monarchy may be as good a means of ensuring strong and central power as any other, but due to French monarchism's association with the Maurrasians, who advocate for a reckless loosening of central authority, and the potential of a separate head of state to undermine de Gaulle's leadership, we should instead structure our new constitution around a strong Presidency."
NFA_restore_the_monarchy:0 "Restore the Monarchy"
NFA_restore_the_monarchy_desc:0 "General de Gaulle, having grown up in a devoutly Catholic family and been influenced to some extent by the writings of Maurras, has never hidden his monarchist sympathies. Although the General's vision of a monarchy, as a central unifying force, diverges heavily from the Maurrasian ideal of a localist state, de Gaulle has resolved to put Henri d'Orléans, Count of Paris, on the throne, in order to legitimise the continued Junta and serve as a centralising figurehead."
NFA_concentrated_power:0 "Concentrated Power"
NFA_concentrated_power_desc:0 "Only if executive power is concetrated in the person of de Gaulle can the executive fulfill its duty to defend and uplift the people. Just as de Gaulle's military theories have seen large numbers of tanks concentrated in hard-hitting offensives, his rule over France will see power concentrated in his office, with nothing but benefits for the common man."
NFA_deal_with_maurrasians:0 "The Maurrasian Question"
NFA_deal_with_maurrasians_desc:0 "With Henri on the throne, de Gaulle's government has won some admiration among the integral nationalists of the Action Française, while de Gaulle has long harboured some admiration for Maurras himself. Nevertheless, the Maurrasians diverge significantly from our government's own centralist policies, and are distrusted by many within the junta. We must tread carefully as we decide our policy towards them."
NFA_croix_de_feu_absorption:0 "Croix-de-Feu Absorption"
NFA_croix_de_feu_absorption_desc:0 "With de Gaulle having chosen to establish a strong Presidency, the Catholic Corporatist Croix-de-Feu party, which has long used its influence within the junta to advocate for such a system, has doubled down on its support for us, and it would be wise to consolidate our ties with them. Nevertheless, some believe that de Gaulle should be wary of its leaders' ambitions."
NFA_guarantor_of_independence:0 "Guarantor of Independence"
NFA_guarantor_of_independence_desc:0 "It is essential that the empowered President is seen by the nation as its protector and the guarantor of its independence from foreign threats, and that he recieves sufficient control over foreign policy to make these claim a reasonable one. De Gaulle's greater involvment in foreign affairs will ensure that France can sufficiently pull its weight on the world stage."
NFA_guide_growth:0 "Guide Growth"
NFA_guide_growth_desc:0 "As the economy recovers from the devastation of the Liberation, and begins to grow once more, it is vital that the state intervenes sufficiently to guide this growth that it might truly benefit the common Frenchman. New corporate taxes and increased public spending will ensure that a strong economy can be enjoyed by every citizen."
NFA_splendour_of_the_strong:0 "The Splendour of the Strong"
NFA_splendour_of_the_strong_desc:0 "Charles de Gaulle has consolidated his grip on power within the junta and within France itself, and shrewd political alliances alongside a reformist economic policy have won him the admiration of much of the population. The necessary strong government of the military will be able to continue for years, and we can breathe a sigh of relief as we know that, under de Gaulleleadership, France will not come to harm."
NFA_darlan_govt:0 "The Darlan Government"
NFA_darlan_govt_desc:0 "Following the retirement of our leader, Philippe Pétain, his protégé and Premier, François Darlan, has succeeded him as President and leader of the military junta. The succesfull Admiral must now deal with the remaining resistance, including his rivals within the military, and establish a foreign policy more in line with his naval interests, and rabid Anglophobia."
NFA_break_with_british:0 "Break With the British"
NFA_break_with_british_desc:0 "All his life, Darlan's instincts have been thoroughly Anglophobic, and he has always had a deep distaste for the opportunism and perfidity of our supposed allies. Now that France has been liberated, we no longer have any need for English meddling in our affairs, or for the pretence of friendship. It is time for France to show the world what it's made of, and go it alone."
NFA_gather_allies:0 "Gather Allies"
NFA_gather_allies_desc:0 "Now that we have broken off the Entente Cordiale, we will need new friends. As such, Darlan has called for the creation of a new system of Paris Protocols, for mutual defence and co-operation among nations neither in the British nor German spheres. Only time will tell whether or not this initiative is a success."
NFA_naval_supremacy:0 "Naval Supremacy"
NFA_naval_supremacy_desc:0 "It was the heroism of the Navy which made the Liberation possible, and they were the only section of the military that was never defeated in the Great War. It thus only follows that the Navy should be given special powers over the other sections of the Armed Forces, and that they should dominate the French government."
NFA_eliminate_disloyal_generals:0 "Eliminate Disloyal Generals"
NFA_eliminate_disloyal_generals_desc:0 "There are still those within the armed forces who are opposed to Darlan's government and his vision of a France guided by the Navy, not least his long-time rival within the junta, Charles de Gaulle. These individuals will only undermine us more and more as time goes by, and we must deal with them swiftly and mercilessly."
NFA_bolster_merchant_marine:0 "Bolster the Merchant Marine"
NFA_bolster_merchant_marine_desc:0 "As we come to dominate the seas, we will have far greater potential to trade around the world, growing our own economy and gaining influence in other countries. In order to do this, howeverm we will need a strong Merchant Marine, with sufficient ships and sufficient protection from our navy to support an ermerging trading empire."
NFA_empower_officer_corps:0 "Empower the Naval Officer Corps"
NFA_empower_officer_corps_desc:0 "As the Navy was the only undefeated part of the military in 1919, and went on to be absolutely crucial to the Liberation campaign, it has shown beyond any doubt that it is the superior branch of the Armed Forces, and indeed the only branch with the credibility to lead the nation onwards. A further effort to fill government posts with naval officers will ensure our dominance."
NFA_control_mediterranean:0 "Control the Mediterranean"
NFA_control_mediterranean_desc:0 "Nothing is as vital to our security as control over the Mediterranean Sea, through which must of our commerce must flow, and which connects us to the colonial empire. As such, we must look to secure our grip over strategic points through the Sea. Only then can our safety on land and sea be assured."

NFA_goods_for_the_masses_desc:0 "Our stronger grip over world trade now allows us to give the ordinary Frenchman access to what were once luxury goods, and in no short supply. By making goods from across the world avalable, and also ensuring a good supply of more essential products, we can bolster the economy and ensure the contentment and loyalty of the people."
NFA_improve_the_constitution:0 "An Improved Constitution"
NFA_improve_the_constitution_desc:0 "The old constitution of the Third Republic, suspended for years now, is thoroughly inadequate for our military government and its duty to serve and defend the people, and the legal paralysis of its ongoing suspension is sure to cause more crises. As such, Darlan has ordered the drafting of a new Constitution entirely for the French nation."
NFA_national_propaganda_machine:0 "National Propaganda Machine"
NFA_national_propaganda_machine_desc:0 "Admiral Darlan understands that it is essential to maintain the people's loyalty, by maintaining control over the information that they consume. It is crucial that the narratives within the media are consistent, coherent, and above all favourable towards the government and President. A more direct state involvment in propaganda, and greater intervention in the media, will ward off subversion for good."
NFA_the_unchallenged_fleet:0 "The Unchallenged Fleet"
NFA_the_unchallenged_fleet_desc:0 "At last, Admiral Darlan has secured his grip on power within the military and the government, within France as a whole, and most crucially on the world stage. No nation dares to stand in the way of the French Navy, and our dominance of the Seas and of world trade has ensured prosperity for the French people, and influence across the globe. Vive Admiral Darlan, et Vive la France!"
NFA_constitutional_restoration:0 "Constitutional Restoration"
NFA_constitutional_restoration_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain has given in to the pressure from his allies in civilian politics, who continued to support his government following his consolidation of power, and formally restored the constitution of the Third Republic, suspended years earlier. Although many celebrate this as a step towards democracy, Pétain has made clear that he intends to remain in power, and the junta, for now at least, remains in place."
NFA_rapid_decollectivisation:0 "Rapid Decollectivisation"
NFA_rapid_decollectivisation_desc:0 "One of the greatest evils of the Commune was its collectivisation of agriculture and industry, which required the theft of farms and factories from their rightful owners and almost invariably led to horrendouds inefficiency. Whatever the short-ter consequences, reversing these disasterous policies is vital for the future of France."
NFA_entrench_business_ties:0 "Entrench Business Ties"
NFA_entrench_business_ties_desc:0 "In order to prevent the restoration of the Constitution from spiralling out of control and ending the Junta, we must consolidate our alliances with influential businessmen and ensure that the reduction in the junta's authoritarianism goes hand-in-hand with a reduction in economic intervention, thus ensuring that the business community will prop up our government."
NFA_correct_state_intervention:0 "Minimise State Intervention"
NFA_correct_state_intervention_desc:0 "In exchange for their continued support and loyalty, we should ensure that our allies in business have a freeer hand to innovate and create wealth for the nation, cutting back the red tape that constrains businesses and slashing taxes in order to remove pointless checks on the market's ability to bring prosperity to the nation."
NFA_review_our_rhetoric:0 "Review Our Rhetoric"
NFA_review_our_rhetoric_desc:0 "Before the Liberation, the junta came to use radically anti-parliamentarian and deeply traditionalist rehtoric, promising an arch-conservative "Révolution Nationale" that would end the Republic for good and restore a traditional ideal of France. This is of course at odds with our new policies, and we must find a way to end the Révolution Nationale without too much controversy."
NFA_delegate_to_civilians:0 "Delegate to Civilians"
NFA_delegate_to_civilians_desc:0 "With our recent moves having won back the loyalty of civilian politicians and the more liberal part of the population, we should put this new-found support to good use and restore civilian involvment in government, with capable politicians and industrialists taking over important government posts while the military remains in control, guiding the nation to ensure stability."
NFA_constitutional_ideal:0 "Safe Elections"
NFA_constitutional_ideal_desc:0 "The restored Constitution forces us to accept frequent elections for all manner of government positions, which if left uncehcked could be a major liability to the stability of our rule. Of course, we cannot let the situation deteriorate to that pointt, and thus we must now look into means of ensuring that these elections are won by good, trustworthy men who wil serve France, and its leader, to the best of their capability."
NFA_president_for_life:0 "Lifetime Presidency"
NFA_president_for_life_desc:0 "Currently, the Constitution forces term limits on the Presidency, meaning that one day Pétain would be legally obliged to retire from his office. Of course, such a prospect is thorougly unacceptable, and among other amendments needed to ensure stability, we can remove all term limits from the constitution, to prolong the Maréchal's benign leadership as far as possible."
NFA_revolving_door:0 "The Revolving Door"
NFA_revolving_door_desc:0 "As we further cement our ties with civilian politics and industry, we should secure the existence of a "Revolving Door" between the military, business, and politics, with loyal and capable men going between these three areas of public life, to ensure uniform competence and loyalty between all three, and further cement our influence through society."

NFA_patriotism_and_productivity_desc:0 "With our alliance with business secure, we should look to remind the people that socialistic demands for heavy-handed state intervention will only weaken the economy and promote Communard revivals, and are thus immensely unpatriotic and seditious. Meanwhile, we should further encourage our friends in industry to do their very best to drive uup growth and productivity, ensuring that the people are content with the results of our policies."
NFA_republican_caesarism:0 "Republican Caesarism"
NFA_republican_caesarism_desc:0 "Just as Caesar's strong leadership and fearless charisma was the last hope of the Roman Republic, until his tragic assassination, Maréchal Pétain's leadership and charisma is the only thing that has allowed the values and ideals of the French Republic to live on, triumphing over stale reactionaries and socialist traitors alike. A new propaganda campaign will ensure that the people know this, and continue to be inspired by Pétain's heroism."

NFA_freedom_under_the_marechal_desc:0 "With our reforms secured, we have managed to both secure the position of the military government and Pétain's loyalists, but also to give the French people genuine freedom, both financial and political, as Republican life slowly returns under the benign presidency of Philippe Pétain, the saviour of the French Republic."
NFA_continue_revolution_nationale:0 "The Révolution Nationale Continues"
NFA_continue_revolution_nationale_desc:0 "Maréchal Pétain, the hero and saviour of France, has inevitably seen off the subversive demands of ambitious officers and corrupt liberals alike.

NFA_military_supremacy:0 "Military Supremacy"
NFA_military_supremacy_desc:0 "It was the military, and only the military, that freed this nation from the red tyrants. Their startegies, their commitment, their sacrifices, and crucially their leadership of the French nation through the Junta was what made the Liberation at all possible. Neither ourselves or the French people must ever forget that, and it is essential that the military continues to form the backbone of the government."
NFA_un_ordre_moral:0 "Un Ordre Moral"
NFA_un_ordre_moral_desc:0 "Central to the ideology of the National Revolution is a traditionalist ideal of French Catholoc culture, based around ruralism and a moral society. It is this ideal which Pétain's government must now implement in the freed métropole, with the Junta having committed itself to a restoration of traditional moral values. New education and cultural programmes will make this ideal a reality."
NFA_rewrite_the_constitution:0 "Rewrite the Constitution"
NFA_rewrite_the_constitution_desc:0 "The ongoing suspension of the Constitution of the Third Republic is only an issue for us in the long term, creating needless legal paralysis and likely to cause future government crises.

NFA_break_republican_modernism:0 "End Republican Modernism"
NFA_break_republican_modernism_desc:0 "Under weak parliamentary rule in the Third Republic, the moral values and traditional ideals which generations of Frenchmen held dear were degraded and attacked by rootless elites.

NFA_sole_leadership_desc:0 "Maréchal Pétain, a hero of the French nation for decades now and a highly astute politician, has no need for his strong leadership to be meddled with or lessened by any over-ambitious crony or subversive politician.

NFA_social_duty_of_army_desc:0 "Although the military as an institution has achieved supreme power within France, it nevertheless has a duty to the people. It is that duty that causes the military to fight at all, that duty which inspired the military to liberate France, and that duty which lies at the heart of the Révolution Nationale. Under the paternal guidance of its army, France will prosper like never before."
NFA_subordinate_capitalists:0 "Subordinate the Capitalists"
NFA_subordinate_capitalists_desc:0 "Although we are deeply grateful for the support that the Junta recieved from those in business before the liberation, we must not get ahead of ourselves in restoring unchecked capitalism or irresponsible business practices.

NFA_return_to_the_earth:0 "Return to the Earth"
NFA_return_to_the_earth_desc:0 "As we seek to promote a revived moral order, we must also promote a revival of the conditions from which that moral order arose: a stable and pious countryside, dedicated to hard work and faith, and confident in its trust in the government.

NFA_maurrasians_hold_on:0 "Maurrasians Hold On"
NFA_maurrasians_hold_on_desc:0 "The move from Paris to Algiers, combined with the shock of rapid decentralisation at the same time as a larger political shift, came close to undermining Maurras's government. However, the loyalty of the AF's allies in the military, particularly General de Hauteclocq, and the determined courage of our supporters, has ensured that the just and valiant leadership offered by the AF will continue, and restore France to the great nation that it was always meant to be."
NFA_enfore_integralist_consistency:0 "Enforce Integralist Consistency"
NFA_enfore_integralist_consistency_desc:0 "The recent crisis proved that our government has still failed to sufficiently assert itself, and prove to the French people that its vision is the only right one for the nation. By popularising Maurrasian principles in speeches and propaganda, we can end the popular ignorance of our political doctrines, and it is imperative that we make sure our narrative and rhetoric remains consistent, if we are to appear a strong and dynamic government."
NFA_local_reconstruction_committees:0 "Local Reconstruction Commitees"
NFA_local_reconstruction_committees_desc:0 "With the shock of our initial measures towards decentralising governance having subsided, we can now further solidify local power by allowing loyal regional governments, formed by local Maurrasian supporters and with the full backing of the Crown, to manage the post-war recovery, both social and economic, on their own terms. This measure will ensure that our longstanding principles are put into practice, and will guarantee that each region of France can rebuild itself in a manner that suits itself."
NFA_cleanse_socialist_decadence:0 "Cleanse Socialist Decadence"
NFA_cleanse_socialist_decadence_desc:0 "The socialism that overtook France in the last two decades was merely an acceleration of the rapid decline of the Civilised World, into a state of materialistic and anarchic decadence, which has been ongoing since the French Revolution. Now that Socialism, the most hideous by-product of this degeneration, lies defeated, its causes and influence must be weeded out throughout French society, whatever the cost, setting a model to the whole world."
NFA_restore_the_pays_reel:0 "Supremacy of the Pays Réel"
NFA_restore_the_pays_reel_desc:0 "Maurras has long observed that there are two Frances, which exist largely apart from the other. There is the Pays Légal, a soulless and mess of documents and officials in [NFA.Capital.GetName], powerless before global finance and social degeneration. And then there is the true France, the Pays Réel, the loyal and devoted people of this nation, who have remained loyal to their traditions and the national cause in spite of all. By greatly diminishing the ability of the central bureaucracy to interfere with regional governments, we can ensure that the Real Country asserts itself."
NFA_restore_provincial_parliaments:0 "Power to the Provinces"
NFA_restore_provincial_parliaments_desc:0 "What generations of decadent Republicans termed the "Ancien Regime" in truth held the key to reliable governance: each province of the Kingdom, within its own boundaries, could enjoy the protection and guidance of the Crown, while governing itself with a high degree of autonomy through its own Parliament, conscious of local needs while also devoted to the Crown and national interest. By restoring these Parliaments, we shall come far closer to restoring the old, true France."
NFA_eliminate_traitors:0 "Eliminate Traitors"
NFA_eliminate_traitors_desc:0 "The issues that we faced in the immediate aftermath of the defeat of the Commune made it all too clear that the enemy within, from the remaining agents of Masonic Jewry to mere petty opportunists, continues to lurk in the shadows, poised to strike at the Kingdom. As such, we must once again conduct a thorough sweep of our government, the civil service, and the military, to hunt down all who are disloyal to our ideals."
NFA_party_dominance:0 "Party Dominance"
NFA_party_dominance_desc:0 "The Action Française has existed as a political movement, in one form or another, since the Dreyfus Affair, and throughout its long life it has inspired many both in France and around the world to stand up for values that they know to be true. However, if our own government is to last and prosper, we must work to make the Party a social institution, incentivising membership and ensuring that ordinary people can use the Party and its internal institutions to push for their goals, granting true freedom to the Pays Réels under the guidance of the King and his cabinet."
NFA_compulsory_camelot_membership:0 "Compulsory Camelot Membership"
NFA_compulsory_camelot_membership_desc:0 "The Camelots du Roi, an institution serving as both a party youth movement and political paramilitary, was granted sweeping powers not long after we first assumed power. However, now that France has been liberated, the Camelots will play a vital role in our efforts to make the Party a major social institution, through which true patriots can exercise political power within their local regions. Mandatory enrollment in the organisation for young men will guarantee that they learn loyalty to the King, and find a place in our new social hierarchy."
NFA_protect_regional_culture:0 "Regional Cultural Revivals"
NFA_protect_regional_culture_desc:0 "No longer can hedonistic socialist internationalism, or the cosmopolitan spirit of a Republic centralised in Paris, threaten and degrade the cultures of each distinct part of France. With the local AF Brances now dominant in each region, alongside the Aristocracy and loyal clergymen, we can focus on restoring the distinct and beautiful cultures and identities of the regions of France, each one integral to the nation as a whole."
NFA_responsible_christian_unions:0 "Union Royale du Travail"
NFA_responsible_christian_unions_desc:0 "The working class of France will always have its grievances, as does every other element of a hierarchical society. However, it is imperative that these grievances are never again allowed to be subverted by Judeo-Masonic Socialists, and our social hierarchy must be built around trust and co-operation. As such, a new national trade union, the Royal Union of Labour, will function within the Party, with its leadership decentralised between the Kingdom's provinces, allowing workers to legitimately improve their lot in harmony with the Crown."
NFA_af_newspaper_circulation:0 "Push the AF Newspaper"
NFA_af_newspaper_circulation_desc:0 "Since the Action Française's founding, our eponymous newspaper has been instrumental in disseminating Maurrasian doctrine, providing commentary on current affairs, and rallying support for the Party. As we consolidate the position of the Party as a universal institution upon which Latin social hierarchies can be built, it is essential that we pour maximum effort into increasing the circulation of this newspaper, ensuring that every Frenchman understands our narrative."
NFA_nationalist_intellectual_rebirth:0 "Nationalist Intellectual Rebirth"
NFA_nationalist_intellectual_rebirth_desc:0 "Maurrasisme, and the AF as a whole, was born out of the many different strands of rightist nationalism that took hold among French intellctuals towards the end of the 19th Century, and were accentuated by the Dreyfus Affair. However, Maurras and most of his old comrades are now old men, and to truly secure the longevity of our ideals we must ensure that the younger generation is ready to carry the flame of integral nationalism, by promoting nationalist movements among students, and ensuring that Maurrasian politics is dominant within the universities."
NFA_agrarian_investments:0 "Agrarian Investments"
NFA_agrarian_investments_desc:0 "The epitome of Maurras's ideal of a good Frenchmen, the embodiment of the Pays Réel, is a humble and patriotic yeoman farmer, living a simple and moral life out in the fiels, and always ready to answer the call of his nation. While we disseminate propaganda urging a return to the fields and encouraging Frenchmen to take up an agrarian way of life, we must also invest heavily in the countryside, to uplift and reward the loyal farmers and artisans of France."
NFA_organic_state_realised:0 "The Organic State Realised"
NFA_organic_state_realised_desc:0 "After every struggle which we have necessarily endured over the AF's long history, and after all the hellish bloodshed of the Liberation, France is at last truly free. Maurras has realised his dream of an orderly, organic nation, built around a natural social hierarchy, and loyal to the values of the Latin race, all united under a valiant and wise King. With the place of the AF Party fully secure and the people's loyalty assured, we truly have succeeded. Vive le Roi, et Vive la France!"
NFA_the_cowled_men:0 "The Cowled Men"
NFA_the_cowled_men_desc:0 "Maurras was, in truth, too old and hesitant to give France the strong leadership that it truly needs. His government's weakness and inaction gave way to social chaos amidst suicidal policies of decentralisation, making it absolutely imperative for Eugène Deloncle to step in, alongside his longstanding allies in business and the intelligence services. Now at the helm of the Kingdom, Deloncle promises a new revolutionary outlook, and unwavering determination to build a bold new vision of France."
NFA_dynamic_heroism:0 "Heroic Dynamism"
NFA_dynamic_heroism_desc:0 "Only a government dedicated to action and idealism, under principled and dynamic leadership, can be a righteous government, and such a righteous government is what we can now build. For Deloncle and his inner circle to rebuild France and its society, they must assume absolute power throughout the nation, sweeping aside both the King's prerogatives, and Maurras's feeble attempts to create a balance powers through decentralisation. France will be one nation, strong and united under its Chief."
NFA_revolutionary_action:0 "Revolutionary Action"
NFA_revolutionary_action_desc:0 "Although the AF's traditionalist principles were admirable, Maurras never went far enough in his assessment of the causes of today's decadence, accepting rationalism and enlightenment philosophy. Only a true Revolution in France, a nationalist and popular Revolution against all the corrupting principles of Enlightenment thought and degenerate culture, can restore France to genuine traditionalism. All barriers to such a Revolution must be swept away by Deloncle's government."
NFA_legionary_rehabillitation:0 "Rule By the Shadows"
NFA_legionary_rehabillitation_desc:0 "Deloncle has always led a secretive clique, rather than a political party, and although he now finds himself at the head of the French nation, and building a new mass movement, the sanctity of his inner circle must be preserved. The upper levels of power will be fully concetrated in the hands of trustworthy Cagoulards, intiated into our order and trusted by the Chief. Only thus can we be certain of the security of our power."
NFA_social_revolution:0 "Social Revolution"
NFA_social_revolution_desc:0 "It is time for the French people to finally stand up for their ideals, and throw off every false and degenerate assertion of the last 300 years, which has been forced upon them by insidious foreign forces, acting to destroy all that is good in France. A true Social Revolution, led on by Deloncle and enforced by his supporters, will use mass political force to topple all these vile ideas, and rebuild the true France."
NFA_consolidate_intelligence_alliance:0 "Intelligence Alliances"
NFA_consolidate_intelligence_alliance_desc:0 "Many of those within Deloncle's inner circle, and many of his allies outside of it, come from the intelligence services, an institution more than used to shadowy plots, and devoted to anti-socialism. Thus, it is crucial that we further entrench these alliances, giving Deloncle allies such as Loustanau-Lacau top jobs within the intelligence services and initiating as many operatives into La Cagoule as we can."
NFA_ensure_market_loyalty:0 "Win Over the Capitalists"
NFA_ensure_market_loyalty_desc:0 "Some within the business community in France, such as Eugène Schueller and Louis Renault, have long been trustworthy supporters of Deloncle, with Schueller giving Cagoulard groups access to his property and funds while being a valued associate of Deloncle. We should expand on these alliances, relaxing Maurrasian corporatist policies and giving business leaders more free reign to innovate, in exchange for pledges of loyalty, and also initiate the most loyal into La Cagoule."
NFA_new_chivalric_elite:0 "A New Chivalric Elite"
NFA_new_chivalric_elite_desc:0 "With the order of La Cagoule expanding and coming to dominate most aspects of French society, we should further consolidate its internal structures and hierarchies, with Deloncle and his closest allies at the top, and demanding full support, while the most loyal and capable can work their way through the ranks of the Order. Like the Knightly Orders of old, we have a clear mission, to be the vanguards of France's Counter-Revolution, and the dynamic leadership needed to succeed."
NFA_destroy_outside_subversion:0 "Expunge Subversion"
NFA_destroy_outside_subversion_desc:0 "Our Order is still, in spite of all our efforts, threatened by a multitude of unscrupulous forces. From Maurrasian remnants, to socialist partisans, to the remaining liberals, many still stand in opposition to our Revolution. This can persist for no longer, and it is time that the full wrath of La Cagoule is directed at these scum who would subjugate France once more. There can be no mercy for a traitor, for he has abandoned all principles."

NFA_le_chef_et_le_roi_desc:0 "With Deloncle now wielding absolute power, both through the regular appratus of state and through his place at the top of La Cagoule, it is time for him to be shown the respect deserved by the Chief of the French. Every citizen, from His Majesty to the lowliest workers and peasants, will show undying loyalty to the Saviour of France, and the popular fury of the ongoing Social Revolution will be unleashed on those who stand in Deloncle's way."
NFA_ritualistic_nationalism:0 "Cagoulard Rituals"
NFA_ritualistic_nationalism_desc:0 "La Cagoule's secretive and elitist structure has long functioned through a strictly observed and highly intricate system of rites and rituals, partly modelled on those present in Freemasonry, and also with an over ultranationalist slant. With the Order and its internal hierarchies now being steadily bolstered, we should expand this system of rituals to become a staple of every Cagoulard's life, and a demonstration of loyalty to the Chief."
NFA_tighten_grip_on_market:0 "Innovation From Above"
NFA_tighten_grip_on_market_desc:0 "Those capitalists who can be brought over to our cause now have been, with many now initiated into the Order and those who proved more resistant dealt with as they deserve. As such, our loyal industrialists and innovators can now be given a free hand to lead the French economy into the future, with La Cagoule ready to protect them from seditious workers' movements and their talents put to the use of the nation."
NFA_absolute_loyalty:0 "Absolute Loyalty"
NFA_absolute_loyalty_desc:0 "Every Frenchman must value one word, one principle, above all else: loyalty. It is crucial for our Revolution to succeed that all show the respect they must towards their King, their Chief, their superiors within society, and, should they be members of our Order, to senior Cagoulards. Only this absolute and unquestioning fealty can revive the best of the French spirit, with total devotion to authority stimulating the awakening of the nation."
NFA_national_social_ideal:0 "The National Social Ideal"
NFA_national_social_ideal_desc:0 "Finally, French society is showing the results of our Revolution, with radical nationalism, discipline, and loyalty becoming deeply valued among every good Frenchman. With France at last corresponding to his vision, Deloncle can now proclaim that his ideal of a nation that is both National - ethnically pure and determined to retain its nationhood - and Social - built around simultaneous values of solidarity and hierarchy - has been realised."

NFA_la_france_de_demain_desc:0 "Under the guidance of Deloncle, his inner circle, and the wider order of La Cagoule, France has been revolutionised from the top down, with the dynamic and heroic Cagoulard elites ruling the country and recieving the loyalty they deserve. Now, the Kingdom looks out to the world stage, awaiting a chance to assert its newfound glory."

NFA_de_gaulle_putsch_desc:0 "Although he felt that the Restoration of the Monarchy was to be welcomed as a unifying force and opportunity for political change, and had to co-operate with the Maurrasians in order to gain the military strength to save France, Charles de Gaulle never believed in the Maurrasian dream of an arch-traditionalist and decentralised state. Following the chaos caused by Maurras's rushed attempts to realise such a state, de Gaulle has intervened to restore order, returning military rule to France."
NFA_disarm_camelots:0 "Disarm the Camelots"
NFA_disarm_camelots_desc:0 "The Camelots du Roi were the longstanding paramilitary force of the Action Française, supporting the party line in street fights while also serving as a youth movement for the sons of Maurrasian supporters. During Maurras's time in power they, and their leader Maurice Pujo, gained immense influence in the government, and are now doing their best to resist de Gaulle's siezure of power. Formally banning the organisation, and disarming those who resist, should remove this obstacle."
NFA_crackdown_on_radicals:0 "Challenge Radicalism"
NFA_crackdown_on_radicals_desc:0 "France is simply too civilised, too great a nation to allow the madness of political radicalism to threaten it, as was shown by the twi failures of Socialism and Integralism. Instead, a responsible and capable centralised state, held in check by the Crown and the military, will justly exercise power over the nation, to defend France from any future challenges. How, after all, can you awaken radical fanaticism in a country that has two hundred and forty-six varieties of cheese?"
NFA_secure_our_grip:0 "Cement Our Grip"
NFA_secure_our_grip_desc:0 "With [NFA.Capital.GetName] firmly in our hands, we must ensure the uniform loyalty of all areas of France, a task made harder by the autonomy that each region came to enjoy in the dying days of the AF.

NFA_end_localist_madness:0 "Reverse Localist Madness"
NFA_end_localist_madness_desc:0 "The fanatical regionalism of Maurras and his sycophants would have doomed France to eternal inertia and instability, had it ever been genuinely realised. Thankfully, the new government under de Gaulle knows perfectly well that only strong central power, exercised both through the Crown and the Premiership, can preserve stability and unite the nation. With [NFA.Capital.GetName] firmly at the centre of the political process, France will be safe from all radical threats."

NFA_into_the_future_desc:0 "With de Gaulle's emergency government having finally stabilised France, the respected General is now preparing to announce free elections in France, after which a new Constitution can be drafted for the Kingdom. As the Orléans Monarchy was historically noted for its liberal tendencies, many within the Royal Family have responded enthusiastically, as have many nations on the world stage. However, it is unclear whether or not any organised opposition will appear, due to the extent of Maurras's purges of liberals."

NFA_liberal_success_desc:0 "Despite the peresecution that French liberalism endured under the AF for so long, the remnants of the Parti Radical, Alliance Démocratique, and others besides, have been rallied by Bertrand de Jouvenel, a liberal thinker from an old aristocratic family, who has long sympathised with royalism, into a new French Liberal Front, which has astonished many by defeating de Gaulle in the elections. De Jouvenel promises a new liberalisation of the economy, and a system of checks and balances in what he sees as France's long tradition of liberalism."
NFA_new_political_configuration:0 "New Political Configuration"
NFA_new_political_configuration_desc:0 "De Jouvenel, despite being fundamentally a liberal, has always been attracted to "new" and radical elements of political thought, fuelling his interest in futurism, and he also makes no secret of the influence which both leftist and rightist radicals have had on his thought. De Jouvenel now promises a genuinely new politics to the French people, in which society can function in harmony, through a genuinely representative democracy and liberal economy, giving every citizen the space needed to innovate and rise to the top."

NFA_balance_of_powers_desc:0 "We cannot allow another inept strongman, such as Pétain, Maurras, or any of the Commune's assorted petty tyrants, to take hold of France again. The new Constitutional Monarchy must function on a basis of consensus, in which no branch of the state can hold sufficient power to establish a tyranny. The separate institutions of Monarchy, Parliament, Military, and Judiciary will all play their role in the State, and will all hold each other in place."
NFA_correct_statist_errors:0 "Economic De-Regulation"
NFA_correct_statist_errors_desc:0 "For all too long, any number of disasterous economic policies, whether socialist or corporatist, have stifled the best talent that France can offer, and strangled ordinary citizens' ability to innovate and enrich both themselves and society as a whole. The various industries nationalised over the past years will be broken up and sold off, and red tape slashed, in order to stimulate a new innovative capitalist spirit in France."
NFA_market_responsibility:0 "Responsible Capitalism"
NFA_market_responsibility_desc:0 "Whatever the beliefs of the most radical members of the emerging free-market school of thought in France, we must not get swept away in our programme of economic liberalisation, and cannot forget where an overly lax attitude to economics leads. The state must keep closely in touch with the direction of the economy, even if it rarely intervenes, and it is essential to make sure that ordinary people are still sufficiently provided for."
NFA_legacy_of_july_monarchy:0 "New Liberal Era"
NFA_legacy_of_july_monarchy_desc:0 "The main part of de Jouvenel's reforms are now completed, with economic prosperity reaching France through the free market, and the new liberal government having greatly succeeding in restoring France's trust among the global community. The nation can now rest easy, for under the sane and responsible guidance of its new democratic institutions, and under the unifying leadership of His Majesty, a new and glorious liberal era has dawned."
NFA_gaullists_hold_on:0 "Gaullist Continuity"
NFA_gaullists_hold_on_desc:0 "Few were surprised by the election results, which showed a clear victory for Charles de Gaulle and his National Royal Rally. De Gaulle now has genuine legitimacy for the first time since his coup, and has recieved a clear mandate from the people to steadily correct the errors of the Maurrasian government while stabilising the Kingdom and working towards economic prosperity for all."
NFA_centralise_power_in_the_crown:0 "Centralise Power in the Crown"
NFA_centralise_power_in_the_crown_desc:0 "The King still, at least nominally, retains the sweeping powers which he gained under the Maurrasian government, even if Maurras only gave him such powers to legitimise his own actions. Nonetheless, it would be a grave mistake to strip the Crown of these prerogatives too hastily, when de Gaulle can use these special powers, exercised through the institution of the Crown, to strengthen the French state, and further centralise it around his own rule."
NFA_control_local_governments:0 "Dominate Local Governments"
NFA_control_local_governments_desc:0 "It would be going too far to entirely abolish the Provincial governments set up by the AF, or to fully strip them of their powers, but we can ensure that they are loyal. By stepping in to promote friendly candidates in new local elections, and in extreme cases ensuring that elections go their way, we can guarantee that these governments toe de Gaulle's line, and steadily give up more powers to the central government."
NFA_necessity_of_intervention:0 "The Necessity of Intervention"
NFA_necessity_of_intervention_desc:0 "The AF was right in recognising that state intervention in the economy is needed to build harmony and co-operation between social classes, and de Gaulle can now expand upon earlier corporatist policies to ensure class solidarity. Meanwhile, we can also use this new increased state intervention to further centralise government power, by centrally managing the Corporate State from the Capital."
NFA_centralise_financial_planning:0 "Centralise Economic Planning"
NFA_centralise_financial_planning_desc:0 "Not only will a centrally controlled system of economic planning better preserve financial stability and class harmony, but it will also further correct the suicidal decentralisation of Maurras's government. As such, new sweeping powers will be granted to the national financial institutions in [NFA.Capital.GetName], to ensure that the economy is in safe hands."
NFA_certain_idea_of_france:0 "A Certain Idea of France"
NFA_certain_idea_of_france_desc:0 "Finally, de Gaulle has succeeded in building a new centralised and united state. With the support of the King, the Army, and the common man, General de Gaulle can further capitalise on his immense popularity to push through the last of his centralising forms. At long last, de Gaulle's "certain idea" of this great nation is becoming a reality."
NFA_new_constitution:0 "Legacy of the July Monarchy"
NFA_new_constitution_desc:0 "From 1830 to 1848, France was a genuine Constitutional Monarchy, under the same House of Orléans that leads us today. Under the first Orléanist Kingdom, the economy was liberalised and industry advanced greatly, brilliant statesmen worked all too hard to build a secure place for France on the world stage, and the nation prospered in unity. That spirit must now be revived, with the government directly reminding people of its political predecessor, the July Monarchy."

NFA_reclaim_indochina_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the collapse of the French colonial empire, the German navy managed to assume control over our Indochinese colonies.

NFA_reclaim_morocco:0 "Reconquer Morocco"

Considering itself heir to the tradition of progressive republicanism rather than socialist class warfare, much of the party sided against the revolution and its parliamentarians joined the government in exile in Algiers. However, in the anti-Communard frenzy of the Exile, the party was quickly marginalised and is now a shell of its former shelf, though it could never have been called particularly influential.§!"
NFA_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Parti Radical\n§LFounded in 1901, the Radical Party or more formally the “Radical-Socialist and Radical Republican Party” is a center-left party  in the tradition of “radical” republicanism. Historically one of the dominant parties of the Third Republic, they are economically and socially liberal, strongly attached to parliamentarism, and secular in the extreme, bordering on anti-clericalism even after the rise in Catholic fervor since the Exile. Of the old major parties, they suffered the worst from the Defeat, the Civil War, and the Exile. Indeed, the left wing of the party initially supported the revolution, before being marginalised by more radical leftists. As such, the party lost the trust of their liberal, educated middle- and upper-class voting base.§!"

Although its staunch republicanism makes the junta distrustful of it compared to the FR and Croix-de-Feu, and it has lost supporters to both parties since the exile, under the leadership of Pierre Étienne Flandin and Paul Reynaud the party hopes to revive its fortunes and breathe new life into the centre ground.§!"
NFA_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Fédération Républicain\n§LThe Republican Federation was founded in 1903 by conservative Republicans, and since then has upheld the values of the democratic right-wing. Although Foch's coup amidst the chaos of the exile, and the military rule since, has greatly weakened Republican parties of all stripes, the FR has been willing to co-operate with the junta, and under the determined leadership of Louis Marin has secured its place as one of Pétain's most important allies in the Assembly, positioning itself as a Catholic and conservative party which can nonetheless uphold the Republic.§!"
NFA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Gouvernement Militaire Provisoire\n§LIn the chaos of the revolution and exile, parliamentary rule broke down, and the great commander and war hero Ferdinand Foch stepped in, being elected Head of State, forming a broad coalition government and declaring a temporary state of emergency giving the government, and the military, broad powers to ensure the stability of the nation. Following his death in 1929, his fellow Great War hero, Phillipe Pétain, steped in to fill his shoes, all but unopposed. Pétain, however, has taken a more conciliatory tone than Foch, and has been willing to work with and delegate to political parties and their leadersip. Nonetheless, this "Temporary Military Government" has now lasted for almost two decades, and almost evert Frenchman is by now embittered against it for any number of reasons. It won't take much for these grievances to come out, and the status quo won't be able to last forever...§!" 
NFA_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Croix de Feu\n§LFounded by nationalistic veterans, with extensive financial support from right-wing industrialists, the Croix de Feu, under the leadership of the war hero Colonel François de la Rocque, has rallied much of the republican right. Staunchly nationalistic, the party vehemently opposes unchecked parliamentary democracy, arguing that its weakness allowed the for fall of the Republic in 1919. Staunchly againt perecieved "hidden socialism" among the democratic left, and supportive of a new corporate state in France, the party has become one of Pétain’s most loyal allies in the assembly, although some are concerned that de la Rocque's own populism and cult of personality among his supporters can't exist alongside Pétain’s presidency forever." 
NFA_national_populist_party_long:0 "Action Française\n§LFounded in 1899 amidst the political chaos and anti-semitic nationalist upheaval of the Dreyfus affair, the Action Française is the origin of integral-nationalist thought, and the champion of Orléans monarchism in modern France. Led from an early stage by the royalist intellectual Charles Maurras, the party seeks to restore an idealised vision of France as it was before the revolutions and rapid changes of the 18th and 19th centuries. The AF upholds principles of localism and state Catholicism, but Maurras's own agnosticism and largely cynical idea of the Church as a unifying and federating force, rather than the true ministry of Christ, has nonetheless caused friction with the clergy. In spite of this, the AF has always been a bulwark of middle class traditionalism, a position greatly strenghtened by the bitterness and resentment against the republican order that has developed since the revolution and exile.§!" 
NFA_national_populist_party_darnand_long:0 "Chevaliers du Glaive\n§LA formerly fringe movement on the French radical right, Joseph Darnand's splinter group from the Croix-de-Feu has now risen to power with the reluctant consent of the junta, amidst an increasingly chaotic political crisis. Inspired by the Romanian legionaires, among other extreme right movements, Darnand's movement defines itself against liberal democracy, capitalism, socialism, and the "Jewish leper", instead embracing a vision of discipline, hierarchy, fanatic nationalism, and "true liberty", under a single unchallenged leader, namely Joseph Darnand himself. The government claims to be deeply Catholic, and to represent "Christian civilisation”, but its often checked violence and radicalism will inevitbaly set it apart from the Church. Linked with many other ultranationalist movements, notably the terroristic secret order of La Cagoule, the Chevaliers are sure to never hesitate to use brutal force and determination in their concolidation of power in France.§!" 
NFA_national_populist_party_cagoule_long:0 "Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire\n§LLa Cagoule was founded in the mid 1930s by the disillusioned monarchist Eugène Deloncle, dissastisfied with the inaction and legalism of the Maurrasians, and by hardline anti-socialists in the Intelligence Services, eager for harsher measures and a stronger government. Nevertheless, when Cahrles Maurras and the AF came to power in France, the two rival reactionary monarchist groups formed a reluctant alliance, with Maurras seeing the intelliegence skills and experience of the Cagoulards as a vital resource.\nAfter the Liberation, however, relations turned sour once again, with Deloncle more and more alarmed by the weakness and divisions of Maurras's government, and distinctly ambitious himself. This culminated in a succesful coup against the Maurrasian government, and now Deloncle and his associates stand as the unchallenged leaders of the Kingdom."
NFA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Gouvernement Militaire Provisoire\n§LWhen Charles Maurras and his allies first came to power, it was due to the increasing weakness of the Military Government to legitimise its rule over France, which forced them to turn to the AF. Indeed, some Generals were pleased by this, and among them was Charles de Gaulle, who despite his views varying from the Integral Nationalist orthodoxy, was very much a monarchist sympathiser. Over the next years, de Gaulle, as Chief of Staff, co-operated with the Maurrasian government and in return recieved a signifcant amount of autonomy in military affairs, and influence within the government. After the Liberation, however, de Gaulle's own opposition to Maurras's localism, and the instability of the AF government, provoked him to stage a coup, and he now stands at head of the Kingdom.§!"

NFA_market_liberal_party_kingdom_long:0 "Front Libéral Français\n§LAn unexpected consequence has arisen from Charles de Gaulle's decision to let free elections take place: liberal politicians and intellectuals who survived the Maurrasian purges have now organised into a new "French Liberal Front" under Bertrand de Jouvenel, who seeks to reconcile the fundamental ideals of French Liberalism with the revived Kingdom, in the spirit of the July Monarchy of the 1830s."

POLITICS_LOUIS_BONAPARTE_DESC:0 "Born in 1914, Louis Bonaparte is a young man who has known exile his whole life. Indeed Louis is since 1926 the head of the Bonaparte family, exiled along with all other former reigning families by French law passed in 1886. Born in Belgium, his family fled to England shortly after his birth, before fleeing further to Switzerland after the British revolution. This allowed him to join the French army, where he quickly rose through the ranks during the war thanks to his heroic deeds, followed by our people with bated breath. Close to PSF, with whom he shares a conception of democratic rule with a strong head, he has surprisingly been elected president by a parliament newly dominated by the Bloc National, creating worry among committed Republicans. Louis Bonaparte has however assured that he would not repeat the modus operandi of his ancestors, praising the Republic for having managed to survive exile and war.\n\nHowever, once a dead movement, monarchical Bonapartism is seeing a rise in popular support, as young Louis enjoys ever-growing popularity. Only time will tell whether or not the Prince will attempt to seize the crown..."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_VI_DESC:0 "Born in 1914, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte is a young man who has known exile his whole life. Indeed Louis is since 1926 the head of the Bonaparte family, exiled along with all other former reigning families by French law passed in 1886. Born in Belgium, his family fled to England shortly after his birth, before fleeing further to Switzerland after the British revolution. This allowed him to join the French army, where he quickly rose through the ranks during the war thanks to his heroic deeds, followed by our people with bated breath. Close to PSF, with whom he shares a conception of democratic rule with a strong head, he was surprisingly elected president by a parliament newly dominated by the Bloc National, creating worry among committed Republicans. Though he had assured them of his commitment to the Republic, the support for the restoration of House Bonaparte on the throne of France quickly grew.\n\nAfter his victory against the German Empire and the reconquest of all rightfully French land, his popularity further skyrocketed, and restoration was a simple formality: a single plebiscite and the Empire was reborn. Committed Republicans were appalled, but the French people rejoiced, as they always knew that the Bonapartes were always destined to lead France to glory."
POLITICS_FRANCOIS_DE_LA_ROCQUE_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, François de La Rocque, commonly referred to as simply “the Colonel”, has accomplished a brilliant military and political career. An alumnus of Saint-Cyr, he was grievously wounded during the Great War, was mentioned in dispatches nine times and became at thirty-three one of the youngest commanding officers in the French armed forces, receiving the Légion d'Honneur for military valour in 1916. A patriot and pious Catholic, he remained loyal to the government as the revolution broke out. After the exile he joined the Croix-de-Feu, a veterans group that quickly attracted tens of thousands of veterans who hoped to revive the spirit of comradeship of the trenches and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming its president in 1931. A supporter of Henri Mordacq, like him he supports democracy and the Republic, though he prefers a strong rule, scarred by the infamous parliamentary instability of the Third Republic. Having founded the Parti Social Français in the early 1930s, the party quickly grew exponentially, becoming the first mass party in French politics, all devoted to the Colonel and his hope of a reformed Republic.\n\nChosen to head the democratic coalition after the end of Marshal Pétain’s junta, he has served France since implementing much of his ideas. However, with the mainland reconquered, the Colonel saw in his former democratic allies the seeds of instability that would once again lead France to her fall, as Communard remnants still lurk and hope for any opportunity to strike. As such, he has formed a new government with military figures, to temporarily head France until full democracy can be safely restored."
POLITICS_LOUIS_MARIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1871, Louis Marin is a veteran of parliamentary politics, having first been elected as a deputy of his native Moselle in 1905, being a founding member of the Fédération Republicaine that he headed until its fusion with the Alliance Démocratique, he has been a part of the Chamber of Deputies for now close to four decades. An ethnography professor, conservative, cultured, patriotic, a moderate Catholic, Marin is the very picture of a distinguished older gentleman, well appreciated by his colleagues and the public at large. An ardent defender of the primacy of parliament, he nonetheless did little to oppose Marshal Pétain’s bid to power, though he still often privately agitated for a restoration of democracy.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those chosen to be a part of the Government of National Unity, a new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the right in the latest legislative elections, he has been elected president, almost as if it was the natural conclusion of his illustrious career. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, he nonetheless hopes to revive the spirit of the early Third Republic and head a conservative, moderate, patriotic regime."
POLITICS_EDOUARD_DALADIER_DESC:0 "Born in 1884, son of a baker, a teacher then mayor of his hometown of Carpentras, Édouard Daladier is a pure product of Republican meritocracy. After years on the Western Front, where he bravely served and received citations and the Légion d’Honneur, he remained loyal to the government after the revolution broke out. In exile, a  man of the moderate left, he was seen with suspicion despite his opposition to revolutionary socialism, especially as he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical, so recently divided as its left-wing joined the socialists in revolt. He fiercely defended the primacy of parliament against Marshal Pétain’s creeping encroachment, which earned him the praise of the few remaining committed democrats and the nickname “the Bull of Vaucluse” for his pugnacity.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, the new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, a lawyer by trade, Paul Reynaud was young enough to be mobilised in 1914 and fight in every major engagement of the Great War, even being dispatched to Russia to assist the White forces in 1918. After the defeat, a man of the moderate right, thoroughly committed to economic liberalism, he joined the ranks of the Alliance Démocratique, revealing himself to be a captivating orator and fierce political animal in the chaos of exile. When Marshal Pétain and his supporters formed an emergency government, he begrudgingly accepted the new status quo, but never wavered in his commitment to his ideals of liberal, democratic Republic. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives.\n\nWith democracy restored, Reynaud is hard at work to restore the spirit of the Republic, deeply damaged by the defeat and the junta. Preferring a more active role as president, he hopes to implement his unorthodox economic ideas, shying away from free-market economics in favour of light dirigisme, making him a somewhat more amenable to the PSF."
POLITICS_CAMILLE_CHAUTEMPS_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, Camille Chautemps could be described as the prototypical Radical. Born into a bourgeois family of Radical politicians, a lawyer by trade, a prominent Freemason, committed to economic and political liberalism as well parliamentary supremacy, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical following the exile, appreciated for his fierce denunciations of the breakaway left-wing of the party, and willingness to compromise with his opponents. He was among those who actively defended a return to normal democratic life following the bid of Marshal Pétain for power but quickly found himself somewhat isolated. Indeed, his Freemason links worked against him, as he was given the nickname of “Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret” by right-wing newspapers, accused of working in concert with the left-wing of the Radical party still active in the Commune.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain, though he was not called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, he remained active in the party. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1889, Pierre-Étienne Flandin is a lawyer by trade, but as the son of a politician, he was naturally predisposed to following in his footsteps. Elected to parliament at only 25, his burgeoning career was cut short by the Great War during which he served with distinction as a balloon observer. There was born his speciality: advocacy for aeronautical development, and precise technical knowledge. Indeed, Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British. A man of the moderate right, he joined the Alliance Démocratique. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives. His skills as a knowledgeable technician have made him indispensable in parliamentary commissions, his advice sought after by the government and across political lines.\n\nIn short, he is an unassuming but unifying figure within Parliament, and as such he was asked to be part of the Government of National Unity after the fall of Marshal Pétain. With the coalition surviving, to the surprise of many, he was the natural compromise between the right and the left. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed regime, parliamentary and liberal."
POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1856, by 1914 Philippe Pétain was on his way towards retirement after a discreet and honourable career as innovative military theorist and professor at the École de Guerre. The Great War destroyed any hope of a quiet retirement, however: from the early days of the war, he distinguished himself as a capable and charismatic leader of men, appreciated by his troops to whom he showed paternal care and quickly shot up the ranks, replacing officers who had failed in Belgium and northern France. Then came Verdun, where he issued his iconic order: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, granting him national fame. His care for proper logistics and morale contributed heavily to the victory, and from then on he was “the Lion of Verdun”. Emboldened by his successes and having earned the respect of the many men that served under him, he was able to restore order during the mutinous mood of 1916, and when the front broke between British and French armies at Amiens in 1918, he was the one who succeeded Supreme Commander Foch and stabilised the front. It was his ideas that permitted the successful counter-attacks, his presence that prevented wider mutiny from occurring. This sadly was not enough to prevent defeat.\n\nAmidst the chaos of the civil war and exile, Pétain held on to his career, and his role in the succesful evacuation of the loyalist forces to Algiers earned him much admiration. Nonetheless, it would be his old superior Ferdinand Foch, not him, who would assume control some months later in a bloodless putsch. Undaunted, Pétain came to be a firm supporter of the new junta, sharing many of his countrymen's belief that a responsible military government would prove to be a unifying force, and get the nation into shape for a future liberation.\nThen, when Foch passed away in 1929, it was Pétain who was destined to fill his shoes, assuming control of the junta largely unchallenged. Since then, he has worked tirelessly to build alliances with both the Croix de Feu and centre-right parties, and has been happy to delegate responsibilities to the Assembly and to civilian politicians when necessary. Nevertheless, he has no intention of doing away with the junta entirely, something which is sure to create tension as time goes by.\nFor now, however, it is Pétain and Pétain alone who is at the helm of France, and the Lion of Verdun bravely roars from the sands of Africa, with but one hope: that one day, he might be laid to rest in the soil of Verdun, alongside the valiant men who he is proud to have led."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Born in 1874, Jean d’Orléans was for long a picture of aristocratic aloofness. He was after all far down the line of succession of the House of France. Barred from service in the French army, he joined the Danish army for some time, as the king Valdemar was his brother-in-law, before eventually settling in Morocco hoping to promote French interests in the region. The Great War would, however, transform him: once again barred from joining the armies of the Republic, he joined the Medical Service of the Red Cross, transforming his French chateau into a hospital and personally taking care of the wounded. Though with initially little interest in politics, the defeat and break out of the revolution would further convince him of the need for deep reform, bringing him closer to the Action Française. In 1924, following the death of his cousin Philippe d’Orléans without an heir, he was acclaimed by royalists as the rightful pretender to the throne of France. In exile in now German Morocco, he would continue the cooperation with the Integralists started by his predecessors. Royalist efforts were now entirely concentrated around the AF, particularly as the Catholic hierarchy went past their issues with the movement, deeply shocked by the anticlerical violence of the syndicalist revolution. In 1933, he issued a manifesto calling for a “royal government” to save France, instead of a “government of parties”, a clear shot at Pétain’s regime: this would further enhance his political profile in a France-in-exile where the prestige of the Republic was at its lowest and the Marshal’s junta was rapidly losing support.\n\nWith the triumph of Charles de Gaulle against democratic and reformist forces, few were surprised that the new head of state called for a restoration of the monarchy. King Jean III now leads France as it struggles to purge the remnants of the Republic from the nation, and prepares her, the Eldest Daughter of the Church, to the holiest of struggles, a crusade to reconquer the métropole from the Reds."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Born in 1908, young Henri d’Orléans has known exile his whole life. He lived a carefree early childhood on his father’s property in Morocco, where he was found to be a particularly bright child, curious and caring of the various workers of the vast plantation, quickly becoming fluent in French, Arabic, English, German, Italian and Spanish. Soon, however, he would be with his father in his chateau-hospital, being exposed to the horrors of war, before having to flee from the wrath of the revolutionaries. This incident would prove deeply traumatic for Henri, sowing the seeds of a later political awakening. Back in Morocco, he was tutored by the best European tutors, who would introduce him to Integralist thought, which resonated deeply with the youth: not just in its deeply reactionary rhetoric, but most particularly in its advocacy of strict adherence to the Social Doctrine of the Church and economic reform along with corporatist thought. Furthering his studies in Belgium, he discovered for the first time the crowded housing, poor working conditions and terrible anonymity of the lives of the European working poor, as he was attending to their needs as part of Catholic charity efforts. When his father became the head of the House of France in 1924, he became its Dauphin, immediately surrounded by advisors who sought to shape the young man into a worthy King of France. As heir presumptive, now banned from France, the dashing Dauphin nevertheless fully dedicated himself to the royalist cause, working closely with the Action Française despite his personal enmity towards Charles Maurras, as he could recognise that the growing movement was the best chance for restoration of the monarchy. His marriage to his cousin Isabelle de Orléans e Bragança in 1931, and the birth of their son Henri in 1933 created further enthusiasm among royalists: the future of the House of France secured.\n\nOften making discreet trips across the border from Morocco to meet with royalist leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Henri was instrumental in the struggle that led to the restoration of the monarchy. In the early years of the renewed kingdom, he assisted his ageing father in every way and was often seen as the real power behind the throne, attempting to outmanoeuvre the Action Française about as often as he worked with them. Now in power, King Henri hopes to continue the rebirth of France, to build a monarchy that will last for another thousand years."

#Initial Ideas
NFA_anti_communard:0 "Anti-Communard"
NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "After our defeat in the Weltkrieg of 1919, the communards rose up again and abolished our cherished Republic. Luckily, some of the most important figures of the Republic have immigrated to Algeria where they plan to organise the counter-revolution. Now that the syndicalist traitors have taken full control of the mainland, we must crush them! We must ensure that our Eternal France will always be free!"

NFA_native_unrest_2:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_native_unrest_2_desc:0 "The Code of the Indiginate remains in place since its creation in 1887. A diverse set of laws and regulations imposed on the native populations of the empire, they enshrine their inferior legal status despite them being technically French citizens. Collective punishment, a paralel justice system, forced labour and service in the armed forces, enforced by native elites under the guise of modernisation and spread of civilisation: to say that the Indigénat has created ressentment would be an understatement. However it has proved to be a sure source of labour for the colonial effort and is supported by many prominent voices in government who argue that maintaining this status quo is necessary to prepare for the Reconquest."

NFA_internal_unrest:0 "Simmering Discontent"
NFA_internal_unrest_desc:0 "Years of inaction and politcal stagnation have caused many elements within the army and the population to become dissatisfied with the current regime, something hardly helped by Maurice Janin's repeated blunders. This has exensively played into the hands of both resurgent liberal parties and the far-right Leagues. Although it is supressed, contestation is slowly but surely growing within the French Republic."

#protests and Petain ideas 
NFA_protests:0 "Widespread Protests"
NFA_protests_desc:0 "The exposure of Janin's corruption has provoked widespread protests against the regime. Almsot every Frenchman has some grievance with the junta, whether he opposes the Republic, the dictatorship, or indeed Pétain's failure to fully assert his power, and this bottled-up resentment has now spilled over. Something will need to change if the regime is to live on."
NFA_prestige_of_verdun:0 "Prestige of Verdun"
NFA_prestige_of_verdun_desc:0 "It was the Battle of Verdun in 1916 which first made Pétain a hero to the nation, and the French people have never forgotten his defence of the nation. By reviving and encouraging these memories, the junta is seeking to revive its popularity."
NFA_liberation_priority:0 "Liberation Priority"
NFA_liberation_priority_desc:0 "Above all else, the junta's greatest priority is the liberation of France, a purpose for which Pétain now seeks to militarise much of French society, mobilising the whole nation towards the goal of one day seeing their homeland again."

NFA_chantiers_de_la_jeunesse_desc:0 "In order to bolster its popularity, the military junta has instituted a system of "workshops", or camps, at which young men approaching adulthood will stay for a few months, to learn physical fitness and moral values. "
NFA_dictatorship_of_morals:0 "Dictatorship of Morals"
NFA_dictatorship_of_morals_desc:0 "By deepening its ties with the Catholic Church and distancing itself from the old liberal secularism of the Republic, the junta has managed to portray itself as a mora, and conservative government, rallying much of the French right behind it."
NFA_revolution_nationale:0 "Révolution Nationale"
NFA_revolution_nationale_desc:0 "Pétain has doubled down on his traditionalist policies, proclaiming a "national revolution" against the old liberal-democratic institutions of the Republic, and against the Communards. Supported by conservatives and more radical rightwingers, this counter-revolutionary ideology will likely dominate French politics for years."
NFA_crusade_for_the_metropole:0 "Crusade for the Métropole"
NFA_crusade_for_the_metropole_desc:0 "Pétain's regime has expanded further on its determination to liberate France, seeking to mass-mobilise French society and the economy, and to deepen citizens' enthusiasm for militarism and the liberation, and reminding them of their compatriots' struggle under socialist tyranny."
NFA_strengthened_intelligence:0 "Expanded Deuxieme Beureau"
NFA_strengthened_intelligence_desc:0 "In order to further infiltrate the Commune in anticipation of the liberation, and in order to monitor and combat dissent at home, Pétain has granted sweeping powers and extensive funds to the nation's intelligence service, the Deuxieme Beureau."

NFA_the_roar_of_the_lion_desc:0 "With Republican liberalism swept away, and French society militarised and mobilised towards the liberation effort, Pétain has finally secured power at home, and now gazes abroad.

NFA_localist_laws:0 "Localist Legal System"
NFA_localist_laws_desc:0 "Although the exile makes it hard to truly implement Maurras's principles of local autonomy, we have nonetheless laid the legal framework for a decentralised state, in anticipation of the liberation. Meanwhile, Maurras has taken the opportunity to extend localist policies to the natives in Africa, to bolster their acceptance of French rule and loyalty to the King."
NFA_traditionalist_culture:0 "Traditionalist Culture"
NFA_traditionalist_culture_desc:0 "Seeking to uphold Maurras's traditionalist ideal of Latin civilisation and classicism, the AF government is seeking to remould French culture, rejecting modernity and romanticism."

NFA_liberty_under_the_king_desc:0 "The AF regime, despite being a dictatroship by all accounts, sees itself as rejecting totalitarianism and tyranny, with which it associates the Commune, and instead sees its regionalism and traditionalism as guaranteeing true freedom for the French people."
NFA_cult_of_jeanne_darc:0 "The Cult of Jeanne d'Arc"
NFA_cult_of_jeanne_darc_desc:0 "In the place of Marianne, decadent icon of the corrupt republic, the AF has sought to celebrate and encourage the popularity of Jeanne d'Arc, medieval heroine of the Hundred Years' War, and a Catholic saint, seeing her as embodying the true French spirit of valour and piety."

NFA_business_alliance:0 "Business Alliance"
NFA_business_alliance_desc:0 "De la Rocque's party owes a lot to patriotic businessmen, whose support has been essential to the movement from its beginning.

NFA_class_cooperation:0 "Class Co-Operation"

NFA_dispos:0 "Dispos"
NFA_dispos_desc:0 "The Dispos are the longstanding paramilitary and security service of the Croix-de-Feu, enforcing the party's presence and protecting its members without resorting to the same petty violence as groups like the Camelots du Roi. With de la Rocque in power, the Dispos have been given increased powers to protect state security."
NFA_french_corporatism:0 "French Corporatism"
NFA_french_corporatism_desc:0 "The Croix-de-Feu's government has consolidated its corporatist economic policies, firmly entrenching a corporatist state in which social classes co-operate and are fairly represented under the oversight of the state, which intervenes when necessary to protect the interests of each social group, and to prevent class conflict."

#Republican ideas
NFA_strengthened_assembly:0 "Strengthened Assembly"
NFA_strengthened_assembly_desc:0 "The Marin government has begun a program of restoring power to the legislature after 17 years of Presidential dictatorship under Foch and Pétain.

NFA_reynaud_economy:0 "Reynaud's Economic Plan"
NFA_reynaud_economy_desc:0 "Louis Marin's coalition has agreed to adopt the economic proposals of Paul Reynaud of the Alliance Démocratique, who urges rapid deregulation of the economy, rolling back taxes and workers' rights legislation in order to create a productive free market reliant on individual dynamism and talent."
NFA_chautemps_economy:0 "Chautemps's Economic Plan"
NFA_chautemps_economy_desc:0 "Louis Marin's coalition has agreed to adopt the economic proposals of Camille Chautemps of the Parti Radical, who urges state intervention in the economy, to keep the flaws of unrestrained capitalism in check, and ensure that the working man is contented and productive, within a system built on class co-operation."

NFA_militia_state_idea_desc:0 "Darnand's own Chevaliers du Glaive movement, alongside other rightist militias and paramilitaries, now dominate the state and day-to-day administration, redirecting the purpose ot the government towards their own needs and ideals, and seeking to rebuild French society in their image."
NFA_legion_capitalism_idea:0 "Legion Capitalism"
NFA_legion_capitalism_idea_desc:0 "The industrial class, especially socially conscious right-wing businessmen, have long been influential in National France, bankrolling a range of nationalist movements. Now that Darnand is at the helm, he has further consolidated this, strengthening ties with what businessmen will accept his government, and seeking to more thoroughly use the market for the benefit of France."
NFA_legion_idealism_idea:0 "Legionary Idealism"
NFA_legion_idealism_idea_desc:0 "The many far-right movements that have coalesced into the Darnand government all share the same celebration of heroic idealism, and of a noble struggle to the end. Some say that ours is a lost cause, out here in the sands of a foreign land, but ours is the right cause, and it will triumph so long as a single one of us is left alive!"
NFA_underworld_connections_idea:0 "Underworld Connections"
NFA_underworld_connections_idea_desc:0 "Many of those who stayed in the Commune to form the resistance there were radical rightists similar to ourselves, who saw little hope in the Republican government in Algiers. Meanwhile, many more see us as a simple lesser evil compared to the Godless tyrants that are the Communards. Either way, Darnand will need the loyalty of the Métropole's anti-socialist underground more than ever in the coming years."

#Colonial Ideas
NFA_native_autonomy_idea:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_native_autonomy_idea_desc:0 "The Action Française has never been attached to jingoistic colonialism, viewing it as a waste of resources better spent on confronting France's real foes. With Maurras in power, the French government has granted traditional native elites, and, in the case of Algeria, native integralists, greater autonomy, in line with the AF's localist values. Although colonial rule remains intact, it is hoped that this will reduce expenditure and dampen native opposition."
NFA_colonial_status_quo:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_colonial_status_quo_desc:0 "The National French government has seen little reason to drastically reform colonial policies, in light of the immense benefits of cheap native labour and of prevailing acceptance of the civilising mission and colonial methods within white society. As such, the colonial status quo will be largely maintained for the forseeable future."
NFA_harsh_crackdowns:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_harsh_crackdowns_desc:0 "With a more hardline and authoritarian government in place, colonial repression within National France has been further expanded, with harsh crackdowns on independence movements becoming far more frequent, and all native political movements banned. The government believes that only this can maintain French rule in the long term, but some are concerned that it will only pour oil on the flames of native opposition."

NFA_empowered_executive_desc:0 "For too long, the lingering influence of civilian politicians and the parliamentary establishment has divided the nation and undermined its true leaders, the military. Only a President given free reign to defend the nation's interests, as Pétain should have been years ago, can truly serve the people. As such, we must eliminate the influence of liberal politicians and push through new legislation to give de Gaulle greater prerogatives to lead the French nation onwards."
NFA_centralised_economy:0 "Centralised Economy"
NFA_centralised_economy_desc:0 "A central executive is necessary not just to ensure stability and order, but also to defend the interests of the people, not least in financial affairs. A planned economy, regulated from [NFA.Capital.GetName] for the collective good, is necessary, with the market held in check and forced to serve the interests of the public, to ensure collaboration between classes."
NFA_ideal_of_joan_of_arc:0 "Cultural Ideals"
NFA_ideal_of_joan_of_arc_desc:0 "Saint Jeanne d'Arc, the peasant girl who nobly came to the defence of the nation in the Hundred Years' War, is the perfect ideal for the French people to aspire. Pious, patriotic, and valiant, every citizen should aspire to emulate her virtues. New education and cultural programmes will ensure that these principles are central to our culture."
NFA_naval_dominance:0 "Naval Dominance"
NFA_naval_dominance_desc:0 "It was the heroism of the Navy which made the Liberation possible, and they were the only section of the military that was never defeated in the Great War. It thus only follows that the Navy should be given special powers over the other sections of the Armed Forces, and that they should dominate the French government."
NFA_naval_propaganda:0 "National Bureau of Propaganda"
NFA_naval_propaganda_desc:0 "Admiral Darlan understands that it is essential to maintain the people's loyalty, by maintaining control over the information that they consume. It is crucial that the narratives within the media are consistent, coherent, and above all favourable towards the government and President. A more direct state involvment in propaganda, and greater intervention in the media, will ward off subversion for good."
NFA_market_relations:0 "Free Market Economy"
NFA_market_relations_desc:0 "One of the greatest evils of the Commune was its collectivisation of agriculture and industry, which required the theft of farms and factories from their rightful owners and almost invariably led to horrendouds inefficiency. Whatever the short-ter consequences, reversing these disasterous policies is vital for the future of France."
NFA_civilianisation:0 "Civilianisation"
NFA_civilianisation_desc:0 "With our recent moves having won back the loyalty of civilian politicians and the more liberal part of the population, we should put this new-found support to good use and restore civilian involvment in government, with capable politicians and industrialists taking over important government posts while the military remains in control, guiding the nation to ensure stability."
NFA_revolving_door:0 "The Revolving Door"
NFA_revolving_door_desc:0 "As we further cement our ties with civilian politics and industry, we should secure the existence of a "Revolving Door" between the military, business, and politics, with loyal and capable men going between these three areas of public life, to ensure uniform competence and loyalty between all three, and further cement our influence through society."
NFA_republican_caesar:0 "Republican Caesar"
NFA_republican_caesar_desc:0 "Just as Caesar's strong leadership and fearless charisma was the last hope of the Roman Republic, until his tragic assassination, Maréchal Pétain's leadership and charisma is the only thing that has allowed the values and ideals of the French Republic to live on, triumphing over stale reactionaries and socialist traitors alike. A new propaganda campaign will ensure that the people know this, and continue to be inspired by Pétain's heroism."
NFA_military_state:0 "Military State"
NFA_military_state_desc:0 "It was the military, and only the military, that freed this nation from the red tyrants. Their startegies, their commitment, their sacrifices, and crucially their leadership of the French nation through the Junta was what made the Liberation at all possible. Neither ourselves or the French people must ever forget that, and it is essential that the military continues to form the backbone of the government."
NFA_moral_order:0 "Moral Order"
NFA_moral_order_desc:0 "Central to the ideology of the National Revolution is a traditionalist ideal of French Catholoc culture, based around ruralism and a moral society. It is this ideal which Pétain's government must now implement in the freed métropole, with the Junta having committed itself to a restoration of traditional moral values. New education and cultural programmes will make this ideal a reality."
NFA_new_intervention:0 "New Economic Interventionism"
NFA_new_intervention_desc:0 "Although we are deeply grateful for the support that the Junta recieved from those in business before the liberation, we must not get ahead of ourselves in restoring unchecked capitalism or irresponsible business practices. The market must know its place, and be held to account in its social duty to provide for the common man, by a new programme of responsible state intervention."
NFA_agrarian_paternalism:0 "Agrarian Paternalism"
NFA_agrarian_paternalism_desc:0 "As we seek to promote a revived moral order, we must also promote a revival of the conditions from which that moral order arose: a stable and pious countryside, dedicated to hard work and faith, and confident in its trust in the government. A new state programme will do its best to encourage good Frenchmen to move to the countryside, and return to their ancestors' agrarian lifestyle."

NFA_maurrasian_doctrinal_cohesion:0 "Maurrasian Doctrinal Cohesion"
NFA_maurrasian_doctrinal_cohesion_desc:0 "The move from Paris to Algiers, combined with the shock of rapid decentralisation at the same time as a larger political shift, came close to undermining Maurras's government. However, the loyalty of the AF's allies in the military, particularly General de Hauteclocq, and the determined courage of our supporters, has ensured that the just and valiant leadership offered by the AF will continue, and restore France to the great nation that it was always meant to be."
NFA_decentralised_reconstruction:0 "Decentralised Reconstruction"
NFA_decentralised_reconstruction_desc:0 "With the shock of our initial measures towards decentralising governance having subsided, we can now further solidify local power by allowing loyal regional governments, formed by local Maurrasian supporters and with the full backing of the Crown, to manage the post-war recovery, both social and economic, on their own terms. This measure will ensure that our longstanding principles are put into practice, and will guarantee that each region of France can rebuild itself in a manner that suits itself."
NFA_regional_autonomy:0 "Localist State"
NFA_regional_autonomy_desc:0 "What generations of decadent Republicans termed the "Ancien Regime" in truth held the key to reliable governance: each province of the Kingdom, within its own boundaries, could enjoy the protection and guidance of the Crown, while governing itself with a high degree of autonomy through its own Parliament, conscious of local needs while also devoted to the Crown and national interest. By restoring these Parliaments, we shall come far closer to restoring the old, true France."
NFA_heroic_idealism:0 "Heroic Idealism"
NFA_heroic_idealism_desc:0 "Only a government dedicated to action and idealism, under principled and dynamic leadership, can be a righteous government, and such a righteous government is what we can now build. For Deloncle and his inner circle to rebuild France and its society, they must assume absolute power throughout the nation, sweeping aside both the King's prerogatives, and Maurras's feeble attempts to create a balance powers through decentralisation. France will be one nation, strong and united under its Chief.."
NFA_revolutionary_nationalism:0 "Revolutionary Nationalism"
NFA_revolutionary_nationalism_desc:0 "Although the AF's traditionalist principles were admirable, Maurras never went far enough in his assessment of the causes of today's decadence, accepting rationalism and enlightenment philosophy. Only a true Revolution in France, a nationalist and popular Revolution against all the corrupting principles of Enlightenment thought and degenerate culture, can restore France to genuine traditionalism. All barriers to such a Revolution must be swept away by Deloncle's government."
NFA_cagoulard_intelligence:0 "Loyal Intelligence"
NFA_cagoulard_intelligence_desc:0 "Many of those within Deloncle's inner circle, and many of his allies outside of it, come from the intelligence services, an institution more than used to shadowy plots, and devoted to anti-socialism. Thus, it is crucial that we further entrench these alliances, giving Deloncle allies such as Loustanau-Lacau top jobs within the intelligence services and initiating as many operatives into La Cagoule as we can."
NFA_cagoulard_capitalism:0 "Cagoulard Capitalism"
NFA_cagoulard_capitalism_desc:0 "Those capitalists who can be brought over to our cause now have been, with many now initiated into the Order and those who proved more resistant dealt with as they deserve. As such, our loyal industrialists and innovators can now be given a free hand to lead the French economy into the future, with La Cagoule ready to protect them from seditious workers' movements and their talents put to the use of the nation."
NFA_new_centralisation:0 "New Centralisation"
NFA_new_centralisation_desc:0 "The King still, at least nominally, retains the sweeping powers which he gained under the Maurrasian government, even if Maurras only gave him such powers to legitimise his own actions. Nonetheless, it would be a grave mistake to strip the Crown of these prerogatives too hastily, when de Gaulle can use these special powers, exercised through the institution of the Crown, to strengthen the French state, and further centralise it around his own rule."
NFA_new_liberal_government:0 "Liberal Awakening"
NFA_new_liberal_government_desc:0 "De Jouvenel, despite being fundamentally a liberal, has always been attracted to "new" and radical elements of political thought, fuelling his interest in futurism, and he also makes no secret of the influence which both leftist and rightist radicals have had on his thought. De Jouvenel now promises a genuinely new politics to the French people, in which society can function in harmony, through a genuinely representative democracy and liberal economy, giving every citizen the space needed to innovate and rise to the top."
NFA_a_responsible_market:0 "Responsible Capitalism"
NFA_a_responsible_market_desc:0 "Whatever the beliefs of the most radical members of the emerging free-market school of thought in France, we must not get swept away in our programme of economic liberalisation, and cannot forget where an overly lax attitude to economics leads. The state must keep closely in touch with the direction of the economy, even if it rarely intervenes, and it is essential to make sure that ordinary people are still sufficiently provided for."
NFA_gaullist_dominance:0 "Gaullist Dominance"
NFA_gaullist_dominance_desc:0 "Few were surprised by the election results, which showed a clear victory for Charles de Gaulle and his National Royal Rally. De Gaulle now has genuine legitimacy for the first time since his coup, and has recieved a clear mandate from the people to steadily correct the errors of the Maurrasian government while stabilising the Kingdom and working towards economic prosperity for all."

# Intro and starting politics

nfa.1.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - History"
nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic fell in the same way it came to be: in defeat by German arms and facing socialist unrest. As the civil war that followed the Communard revolution of 1920 eventually came to a close, the government chose exile instead of surrender. Having retreated to Marseilles, they embarked with the French navy towards Algiers, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the Boches. Neither happened and instead, a peace treaty was concluded between the German Empire and the Commune, with little to no regard towards the exiled government. The Commune was recognised as the successor of the French Republic by most of the newly German-aligned world, while the exiles remained seen as the legitimate government by those who had fought beside them in the Weltkrieg. But the refugees refused to be cowed: they renewed their claim as the legitimate government of all of France and her empire and their commitment to the Entente, preparing for any opportunity to strike.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the exile proved highly unstable. With the remnants of the Parliament and mainstream parties thrown into chaos by the defeat and exile, the great commander Ferdinand Foch seized control in a bloodless putsch, ruling at the head of a thinly-veiled junta until his death in 1929. His shoes were filled with ease by his fellow war hero, Phillipe Pétain, the Lion of Verdun. Pétain's rule has, so far, been percieved as less autocratic than his predecessor's, with the Maréchal willing to delegate to the Assembly and civilian politicians when needs be, and chosing to co-operate with the parties of the centre-right, as well as the corporatist Croix de Feu. Nevertheless, he alone is the leader of France, and the constitution remains suspended and ignored, with the military continuing to dominate both politics and the economy, and parliament often sidelined. However, Pétain’s premier, General Maurice Janin, has a less than admirable record of incompetence, and his many blunders may soon catch up with him and his government..."
nfa.1.a:0 "Those Accursed Communards!"

nfa.2.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - Political Situation"
nfa.2.d:0 "The circumstances of the revolution and exile have convinced Maréchal Pétain, and a large proportion of the population, that only a dynamic and authoritarian rule can save France, at least until the métropole is liberated. However, both far-right royalists and liberals are increasingly dissatisfied with the regime, and are slowly becoming restless for change. This is not helped by the percieved incompetence of the Premier, Maurice Janin, who has already endangered the government with his blunders before, and may well do so again. Even Pétain's allies in the Croix de Feu and FR are starting to grow impatient with the political stagnation, and de la Rocque's corporatists are increasingly hindered by internal factionalism, making them hardly the ally they once were. To put it simply, the junta is slowly but surely losing political credibility and is now mainly held together by the prestige of Pétain."

nfa.3.d:0 "As if this lack of civilian support wasn’t enough, trust in the Marshal is starting to erode within the army, the backbone of the regime. Pétain’s favouritism towards his protégés has put many in key positions, and though they certainly are competent, many officers are left behind while others worry that this could encourage doctrinal rot, that Pétain is surrounding himself with yesmen. Increasinly, debate is flairing up within his clique, between General de Gaulle and  Admiral Darlan, whose proposals for the Libération are starkly different, over how the military should prepare to free the métropole.\n\nThe most important problem facing the nation, however, is simply its situation, in exile. Though in Algeria, officially annexed as part of France as an overseas department in the late 19th century, exiles and pieds-noirs settlers make up a significant part of the population, in some major cities even making up a majority, overall Europeans are still a small minority ruling over millions of indigènes, who despite being considered Frenchmen are essentially second-class citizens, subject to heavy taxes and forced labour, with rule from Algiers enforced by native elites and the army. Since the defeat in the Weltkrieg, the colonial situation is precarious: unrest is ruthlessly put down, recent famines were badly managed, syndicalist and pan-Arab agents spread propaganda against colonial authorities. However, most traditional indigenous elites are still loyal to France, and there exists a growing class of French-educated natives and native war veterans who despite wanting reform remain loyal. But one thing is clear: if the government is careless, further unrest and perhaps even revolts are bound to happen.\n\n§RBe careful! A failure to keep the resistance in non-core African states under 80 will result in revolts.§!"

Though the situation is unfortunately tense at home, given the magnitude of the event it is important for the Entente that the Lion attends the funeral of George V and the coronation of his son Edward, and more personally for Pétain it is important to mourn a friend and ally, who like him oversaw the exile of his people after bloody revolutions in their homelands, and like him was wholeheartedly dedicated to one day come back and retake what is rightfully theirs. And so Marshal Pétain embarked on a special Trans-Atlantic flight, ready to honour the memory of a friend but celebrate a new era of Anglo-French friendship."

They then drove to Windsor, where late King-Emperor George had asked to be buried. After a grandiose and emotional ceremony where Pétain was finally able to say farewell to a personal friend and ally, he took a tour of Ontario and Québec, greeted all along the way as a friend of the Empire, before meeting with King Edward VIII. In a pre-planned move, the two men shook hands in front of the media of the world, and the new king declared that no matter the struggles the future holds, the French and British nations would always fight side by side in this great crusade against the syndicalist threat. Later on, the two men held a private talk, discussing current issues facing the Entente, the policies that both men were planning on undertaking, as well as the inevitable prospect of war. The mutual undying commitment of both nations to each other was, of course, renewed, announcing even stronger bonds within the Entente."

natfra.6.t:0 "A Murder in the Casbah"
natfra.6.d:0 "Shocking news has reached the nation today. Last night, the retired General Henri Mordacq was found dead in the Casbah, having been stabbed repeatedly and left to bleed out in the gutter. Mordacq had a glittering career in the Great War, successfully holding the town of Arras against the Germans in 1914, and becoming deeply influential in the Clemenceau government. However, he became far too indebted to the Tiger for his own good, and with the fall of the Clemenceau government amidst the revolution and Foch's coup, his political career collapsed. His military career soon followed, with the general staff increasingly wary of his unorthodox theories. Nonetheless, by the time of his death he had become a prolific writer, and his fierce defence of Clemenceau had made him a prominent figure among liberals.\nAlready, the right-wing press, notably the Croix-de-Feu's paper Le Flambeau and of course the Action Française, are pointing the finger at natives, Jews, socialists, and everything in between. Notably, this cause has been taken up by Joseph Darnand. This is the first major scandal to have broken out since he split from the Croix-de-Feu, and he clearly wants to make a success of it, calling in harsh and clear terms for a crackdown on Algerian nationalists.\nMany in the Pétain government, even if they lack the same hysteria, are also now calling for an investigation focused on Arab organisations in the Casbah and possible socialist infiltration, arguing simply and persuasively that these groups were likely behind the old general's death. However, some are arguing that we can't point the finger at any specific group yet, and a much broader investigation is needed. Janin's cabinet has so far been unable to reach a decision, and the premier himself seems dangerously indifferent. As such, the matter has reached Pétain himself, who must now come to a decision."
natfra.6.a:0 "The Arabs were obviously behind this, let's clean up the Casbah."

natfra.7.t:0 "The Culprits"
natfra.7.d:0 "After weeks of investigation, loyally aided by numerous white citizens who were present in the Casbah at the time, it has been made clear beyond much doubt that Algerian nationalists were at fault for Mordacq's murder. Although a specific murderer has not yet been found, and those we have rounded up have proved notably resilient under interrogation, it is quite clear to all involved that cells of the socialist and Algerian nationalist ENA, and its associated groups, were responsible.\nAs such, the government has resolved to order a new crackdown on nationalism and native groups across Algeria and the West African colonies, lest this happen again. Meanwhile Joseph Darnand, whose own nephew aided the police during the investigation, has emerged from his first major political test stronger than ever."
natfra.7.a:0 "I want all these Arabs behind bars before sunset!"

natfra.8.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrest"
natfra.8.d:0 "Today, the news splashed across the front pages has astonished most. The murderers of Henri Mordacq have been clearly proven as guilty and rounded up. They are, however, a far cry from the Arabs, Jews, or leftists whom Maurras and Darnand had accused. Rather, the guilty men are outwardly respectable white citizens - and among them, crucially, is Henry Charbonneau, Joseph Darnand's own nephew and a former member of the Action Française, who drifted further to the right and joined more fringe leagues. This connection to the murder has greatly embarassed Darnand, and aroused a great deal of suspicion. Clearly, the circumstances and motives behind Mordacq's death will have to be looked into even further."
natfra.8.a:0 "This doesn't seem right..."

natfra.9.t:0 "La Cagoule"
natfra.9.d:0 "After much investigation and infiltration by the police, the full shocking truth of Mordacq's death has now become clear.\nThe naval veteran and engineer Eugène Deloncle, who had initially supported the AF before leaving it due to his frustration with Maurras's unwillingness to violently seize power, has formed a deep-running and extemsive terrorist organisation, up to now in total secrecy. Deloncle's organisation, dubbed "La Cagoule" by the AF writer Maurice Pujo, due to the cowls they wear in their initiation rituals, seemingly sought to inspire harsher crackdowns against liberals and Arab nationalists, as well as further radicalise the French right, by framing leftist or Arab groups for terror attacks, as happened in the case of Mordacq.\nThe group, it is clear, has enjoyed the support of several notable industrialists, most notably the founder of L'Oréal, Eugène Schueller, and countless previously respected figures have been implicated in the scandal. Most prominently among these is Joseph Darnand himself, now revealed to be an active member of the organisation, and directly complicit in the death of the general. Although an attempt was made to bring him to justice, his home was found abandoned, and it is believed that he has fled across the sea to Romania."

natfra.10.t:0 "Janin's Plan"
natfra.10.d:0 "Pétain's premier, Maurice Janin, has few redeeming features. He is uncharismatic, unmotivated, incompetent, and prone to political blunders. He is, however, loyal, and it is that loyalty that has inspired him to come to the Maréchal today with an undesirable, if necessary, proposal.\nIn order to ensure that he has the political capital to push through the military spending that is needed to get the army into a fit state for the Liberation, Janin intends to pay off a large number of deputies in the Assembly.\nAlthough he knows that such corrupt measures are far from ideal, and could cause significant problems if leaked, Janin is certain that it is the only way forward, in light of growing frustration with his government and abilities. Reluctantly, Pétain can only agree."
natfra.10.a:0 "Let's at least hope this can be kept quiet..."

natfra.11.t:0 "The Scandal Breaks"
natfra.11.d:0 "In news that surprised few in the know, Janin's corruption has today been exposed, in all its sordid detail. Elaborate bribes, distrubing threats, even promises to turn a blind eye to blatantly illegal activity in exchange for support: all have been common practices of the Janin government, and all have intensified recently as Janin makes a belated effort to strenghten his hand. Everyone from the staunch liberal Camille Chautemps to Charles Maurras and Joseph Darnand has harshly rebuked not only Janin but Pétain himself, and although Janin's own fall from power is now a certainty, some even speculate that the Junta itself is on the way out."
natfra.11.a:0 "Ah, muerde..."

natfra.12.t:0 "Janin's Resignation"
natfra.12.d:0 "Today, the inevitable came to pass, and, after two days spent locked away in his office, Maurice Janin gave a short, regretful speech to a jeering assembly, announcing his immediate resignation. It is clear that Pétain himself had forced him out, threatening that if he didn't go quietly he would lose not only his rank in the army but his liberty as well. And thus fell the Janin regime, ineffectual and shambolic to the end. Pétain's next move as he attempts to stabilise the situation is for now unknown, but members of the Croix-de-Feu, FR, and even AF have all been seen meeting with representatives of the junta."
natfra.12.a:0 "What lies next?"

natfra.13.t:0 "Our Next Move"
natfra.13.d:0 "Ever since Janin resigned, the Republic has been without any Prime Minister, and the junta has been in chaos, with Pétain forced to take on the daily administrative responsibilites that he has grown used to delegating. Meanwhile, protests supported by everyone from liberals to legionaires are continuing in the streets, and we are running out of time to stabilise the situation. As such, two possibilites lie before Pétain.\nFirst, as is suggested by many, he could seek to gain the support of civilian politicians, through more... legitimate means than Janin had used. This would entail entering into discussions with either François de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu and darling of the far right, or Louis Marin, leader of the centre-right Fédération Républicain. Either man would be able to use his political prestige and support base to restore confidence in the regime, but would also demand extensive concessions in exchnage for doing so: something which has isnpired some Pétain loyalists to urge the Maréchal not to bother talking to any politicians. Civilian politics, they argue, is responsible for dragging France into the chaos it currently faces, and it is time for Pétain to fully secure the junta's position and bend the Assembly to his will.\nThe old marshal must chose a course of action, but he has little time..."
natfra.13.a:0 "Arrange a meeting with de la Rocque, we need nationalist backing."
natfra.13.b:0 "We have to maintain the basis of the Republic: reach out to Marin."
natfra.13.c:0 "Enough is enough. Declare martial law in Algiers!"

natfra.14.t:0 "A Meeting with the Colonel"
natfra.14.d:0 "As faithfully arranged by Pétain's supporters, the Lion of Verdun, the respected commander of the Great War, has met with François de la Rocque, a heroic common soldier from the same conflict. While Pétain rose first to the position of Foch's right-hand man, de la Rocque became active in veterans' groups, joining the right-wing Croix-de-Feu in 1927 and taking it over two years later, the same year that Pétain succeeded the late Foch as President. Since them, de la Rocque has greatly expanded his organisation from a vaguely nationalistic group for disgruntled old soldiers to a formidabble political movement, advocating for corporatist economics, French nationalism, and a strong Presidency. Perhaps predictably, the Croix-de-Feu has so far been glad to support the Junta, gaining the votes of many of Pétain's sympathisers among the public and has been vital in maintaining parliamentary support for the junta.\nAlthough de la Rocque now promises that he will continue to stand by Pétain no matter what, he today suggested to the Marshal that appointing a new cabinet, dominated by members of the Croix-de-Feu, with himself as Premier, would go a long way to resolving the crisis. He is, indeed, correct. With open backing from de la Rocque's newspaper, Le Flambeau, his paramilitary "dispos", and from his extensive support base, the junta will surely be able to move on from the crisis. Nonetheless, some allies are cautioning Pétain that granting de la Rocque such influence may well lead to the end of the junta, with de la Rocque slowly displacing the Maréchal."
natfra.14.a:0 "We must be sure of his backing, we have to accept."
natfra.14.b:0 "He'll stay loyal anyway: we don't need to give him so much power."

natfra.15.t:0 "The de la Rocque Cabinet"
natfra.15.d:0 "Today, Pétain appeared before the assembly to give an extensive speech, broadcast to the nation over radio, admitting the failings of the junta and acknowledging the need for reform. With that in mind, he went on to announce that the popular right-wing nationalist, Colonel François de la Rocque, would be appointed as his new premier, with a cabinet dominated by the Colonel's allies in his party and in business. This is a significant change in direction for the junta, as de la Rocque, despite his military past, left the army shortly after the war, and is thus the first civilian Premier since Foch's coup. Such a major step has astonished many around the world, and, although the nature of de la Rocque's policies hardly makes this a sign of liberalisation, the sun may be setting on the Junta."
natfra.15.a:0 "Good luck, Premier de la Rocque!"

natfra.16.t:0 "Martial Law"
natfra.16.d:0 "With the crisis dragging on, and his opportunities to form political alliances either exhausted or refused, Maréchal Pétain today took the drastic step of declaring martial law in Algiers, citing "the ongoing struggle against syndicalism" as his formal reason. Of course, this has confused few, and it is obvious that he intends simply to consolidate his own power. Later in the day, a large number of soldiers, led by General de Gaulle entered the Assembly. Reluctantly unchallenged by the liberals and greeted with cheers by the delegates of the Croix-de-Feu, they presented a simple bill, declaring full support for Phillipe Pétain and recognising him as both President and Prime Minister. The motion was adopted near-unanimously, and the handful that voteed against it were promptly placed under arrest.\nNow, young soldiers patrol the streets of Algiers, rounding up Arab nationalists in the Casbah and liberal dissidents in the European quarter. Opposition to Pétain will doubtless fast evaporate, as politicians scramble to save their careers and freedom. Although it has taken brute force to secure the junta, and some condemnation may come our way, this alone could have saved France."
natfra.16.a:0 "Vive le Maréchal!"

natfra.17.t:0 "A Meeting with Marin"
natfra.17.d:0 "As faithfully arranged by Pétain's supporters, the Lion of Verdun, the respected commander of the Great War, has met with Louis Marin, a conservative politician and staunch republican. When Foch assumed control of the government, Marin was one of many centrist politicians who reluctantly accepted the junta as a stabilising force. Over the 1920s, he came to staunchly defend the Foch regime from both its opponents and his own party, and with the tacit backing of the Junta, took charge of the Fédération Républicain, a Catholic conservative party nonetheless commited to the Republic. When Pétain succeeded Foch in 1929, Marin aided in the smooth transition of power, and has since been a prominent, if reluctant, supporter of the regime in the assembly. Pétain for his part has been willing to delegate policymaking and day-to-day administration to the FR, among other parliamentary allies.\nHowever, Marin is now suggesting that only reforms can restore the people's confidence in Pétain's government. As such, he is urging the Maréchal to appoint him as the new Premier, with a cabinet made up of liberals and republicans, to slowly prepare the French nation for a return to democratic life, once the Métropole is liberated. However, many in Pétain's clique argue that we cannot risk allowing liberals too much influence, and that parliamentary chaos must be avoided."
natfra.17.a:0 "Reform is the way forward, accept his proposals."
natfra.17.b:0 "Politicians' bickering got us into this mess in the first place!"

natfra.18.t:0 "The Marin Cabinet"
natfra.18.d:0 "Today, Pétain appeared before the assembly to give an extensive speech, broadcast to the nation over radio, admitting the failings of the junta and acknowledging the need for reform. With that in mind, he went on to announce that the veteran conservative and republican, Louis Marin, would be appointed as his new premier, with a cabinet dominated by republican politicians and liberal-minded businessmen. This is a significant change in direction for the junta, Marin, a longstanding deputy and leader of the Fédération Républicain, is the first civilian Premier since Foch's coup. Such a major step has astonished many around the world, and, although Marin would certainly have had to accept the continuation of the Pétain presidency to get this far, this may well be a sign of steps towards democratisation."
natfra.18.a:0 "Good luck, Premier Marin!"

natfra.19.t:0 "Time's Running Out" 
natfra.19.d:0 "Having turned down his allies' overtures, and with the protests ongoing, Pétain is an increasingly difficult position. Although both de la Rocque and Marin have promised that they will continue to stand by the junta, our refusal to make meaningful concessions to either man has certainly ensured that their support will be hardly vigorous in the coming weeks. And, with the protesters going nowhere, this won't be enough.\nWith this in mind, multiple allies of Pétain, including both General de Gaulle and Admiral Darlan, are now once again urging the Maréchal to declare martial law, argung that civilian politics has lead to this chaos, and that it is time for us to move on from it for good, if the junta is to live on and the métropole is to be retaken. However, others are urging us to make discreet overtures to various far-right leagues, to see if their support will bolster our image."
natfra.19.a:0 "Enough is enough: martial law it is."
natfra.19.b:0 "We can do this legitimately if we gain the leagues' support."

natfra.20.t:0 "Maurras's Gambit"
natfra.20.d:0 "Having been quietly contacted by associates of the President looking for backing, Charles Maurras, the political philosopher and dominant politician of the Orléanist monarchist and integral-nationalist Action Française, has seemingly formed a clear impression that the junta has become desperate for support. It is with this in mind, it appears, that he and his allies in the AF today announced a new motion in the assembly, to formally lift the law of exile against royal pretenders, allowing them back into France. Although this is not an outright effort at restoring the monarchy, it is the crucial first step to doing so, and thus an extremely ambitious move on the part of Maurras.\nEspecially telling was Maurras's humble request, repeated in later speeches by Maurice Pujo and Henri Massis, for the support of President Pétain in his efforts. Of course, such an endorsement of Maurras's move would allow the act to pass with ease, and lead on to a restoration of the monarchy. But, it would seem, Maurras won't take anything less in exchange for his support."
natfra.20.a:0 "We need allies, give him our backing."
natfra.20.b:0 "This is too far: we can't allow the republic itself to be destroyed!"

natfra.21.t:0 "The Unlikely Alliance"
natfra.21.d:0 "With the law of exile having been repealed with Pétain's backing, Jean d'Orléans, the Duc de Guise and Orléanist claimant to the throne, has arrived amidst royalist celebrations in Algiers. He was also greeted by General de Gaulle, a clear sign of the junta's growing willingness to back monarchism, as well as a reminder of de Gaulle's own royalist instincts. Many now predict a restoration of the Orléans monarchy within the near future, claims that the junta has been hesitant to deny.\nMeanwhile, the newspaper and supporters of the Action Française have taken a firmly pro-junta stance recently, rallying around Pétain as the presumed saviour of their hopes of a restoration, and encouraged in this by Maurras and Pujo. Confronted in the streets by the AF's paramilitary Camelots du Roi, the protests have also begun to fade away. A new mood of optimism has set in around the Presidential palace, and Pétain is glad that the tide has finally turned in his favour." 
natfra.21.a:0 "All as planned!"

natfra.22.t:0 "A Spanner in the Works"
natfra.22.d:0 "Until today, all has been going well and smoothly in our collaboration with Maurras and the AF. Most have come to believe that the junta will live on, even if the monarchy will return. However, things became notably more complicated today.\nWith the repeal of the law of exile having allowed every royal claimant to return, Louis Bonaparte, claimant to the throne of the French Empire, arrived in Tunis today. This has considerably disrupted our plans for a smooth consolidation of power, with the roots of a resurgent Bonapartism now beginning to grow: having to chose between two royal houses is less than desriable. Many of Pétain's allies, including de Gaulle, simply argue that we should ignore Bonaparte. The Empire fell in 1870, and there is no organised political movement equivalent to the Action Française that can fight for its restoration.\nHowever, others, including François Darlan, are arguing that this is a good opportunity not to let Maurras's influence grow too out of hand, and that we should tacitly support Bonaparte."
natfra.22.a:0 "We owe Maurras our loyalty: ignore him."
natfra.22.b:0 "We should be wary of the AF's power, endorse Bonaparte."

natfra.23.t:0 "Pétain's Speech"
natfra.23.d:0 "Today in Algiers, President Pétain, flanked by military loyalists and Action Française politicians alike, gave an extensive and charismatic speech, detailing the failures of the Republic. Blaming the inherent weakness and infighting of parliamentary rule for the defeat in both the Great War and revolution, and in the short term for the corruption that brought down Marin, Pétain declared that only a return to monarchical rule, under the House of Orléans, could save France, and that preparations would be made for a restoration. The old marshal also proceeded to announce a new cabinet, dominated by prominent members of the AF.\nWith monarchists celebrating in the streets, and both Maurras and the Duc de Guise having declared their happiness at this turn of events, it is clear that the future if France is a future under its King."
natfra.23.a:0 "Vive le Roi de demain!"

natfra.24.t:0 "Maurras's Anger"
natfra.24.d:0 "With Pétain having publicly given his tacit support to the young Louis Bonaparte's claim to the throne, the Orléanist Action Fran����aise, which has so far been invaluable to our efforts to preserve the junta, has been thrown into a fury. Senior members of the AF have stormed out of meetings with Pétain loyalists, and Charles Maurras's own less than flattering remarks about the President have been eagerly picked up by sensationalists in the press.\nWith this new crisis threatening to undermine our continued control in power, many within Pétain's clique, notably General de Gaulle, are strongly urging the Maréchal to mkae a necessary U-turn and cut off his support for the Bonapartists, and thus seek to again placate the AF. However, many others insist that by distancing ourselves from the AF, we made the right choice, stopping our influence from growing unchecked. Turning around now, they argue, would be humiliatimg, and we should instead dig in our support of the Bonapartist claim, and weather the storm."
natfra.24.a:0 "We've come this far in support of Bonapartism; we can't backtrack now."
natfra.24.b:0 "We have to eat our words and try to find a settlement with Maurras."

natfra.25.t:0 "The Third Empire"
natfra.25.d:0 "With Pétain having doggedly supported the Louis Bonaparte for several weeks now, in the face of anger from liberals and the far right alike, few were surprised today, when President Pétain declared the Third Republic to be at an end. In a simple and brief act, obediently passed by Pétain's allies in the assembly in spite of the Orléanist AF delegates storming out, the French Empire, the great nation which once had stretched from Haiti to Moscow, was reborn. Louis Napoleon, having met repeatedly with Pétain over the past weeks, was declared Emperor and a formal coronation is said to be under preparation.\nAlthough many came to predict such a move, the restoration of a largely discredited monarchy, which has never had a political movement to continue its legacy like the Orléanists, has come as a profound shock to almost everyone. Nevertheless, most citizens have taken a positive attitude to the restoration, and have come to hope that the young Louis, with the loyal aid of the Lion of Verdun, can restore the greatness of his ancestor."

natfra.26.t:0 "An Offer from Darnand"
natfra.26.d:0 "With political instability ongoing, and the rift between the junta and far right only increasing, something must be done. And it seems, at last, that we have a solution. The minor but nonetheless increasingly popular far right leader, Joseph Darnand, who claims inspiration from the Romanian legionaires, has approached Pétain, Maurras, and de la Rocque with a proposal for a "meeting of national pacification" chaired by himself. Describing his goal asthe unity of the French right behind Pétain, to strenghten and bring together the nation in preparation for the liberation, Darnand believes that his relatively fringe position to the other men will let him position himself as a compromise candidate and a mediator between them, in spite of his being significantly more radical than the others.\nEven if darnand himself can find little goodwill among Pétain's clique, most of the Maréchal's advisors are urging that we take the opportunity to attempt to further unite the nation. Time, they insist, is running out to resolve the crisis, and we must take this opportunity to find allies."
natfra.26.a:0 "We need a united nation, arrange the meeting."

natfra.27.t:0 "The Meeting of National Pacification"
natfra.27.d:0 "Charles Maurras and François de la Rocque, the two great rivals of the French right, faced each other uneasily from opposite sides of the table. Staring distractedly out of the window of the Presidential Palace, de la Rocque looked down on the sprawl of Algiers below. Maurras, meanwhile, gazed at the large Presidential Standard on the wall opposite, admiring the detail of Pétain's axe symbol. The impending arrival of President Pétain himself, not to mention that of the upstart Darnand, hardly reduced the tension. In spite of their many differences, neither man could understand what Pétain saw in this deluded legionaire, or how Darnand could possibly think he could stabilise the nation. But they had both needed to appear commited to national unity, and so they had both obediently arrived at the palace an hour before.\nThe patter of footsteps began to resonate from the corridor outside, and Maurras and de la Rocque alike braced themselves for long hours of argument, both knowing it would be in vain. They heard the doors open, and what seemed to be the President commenting to an aide.\n\nAnd then, the bomb went off, and all the tension, all the rivalry, was swept away in fire and chaos."
natfra.27.a:0 "Quelle catastrophe!"

natfra.28.t:0 "The Saviour of France"
natfra.28.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Presidential Palace bombing, the entire nation and administration fell into chaos. With Charles Maurras and François de la Rocque both dead, their parties rapidly fell into chaos, amidst infighting and, more importantly, total shock and astonishment at what had happened. President Pétain, for his part, was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, leaving him unable to maintain order while his allies squabbled among themselves. \nIt was only Joseph Darnand who could offer the vision, determination, and strength needed to save France in its hour of need. With the bomb having gone off mere minutes before he arrived at the palace, he was at the centre of events from the start. His natural charisma soon allowed him to take charge of the efforts to maintain order, ensuring that the President could safely get to hospital. Shortly afterwards, understanding the gravity of the situation and how thoroughly France had been betrayed by its politicians, he ordered his loyal militiamen to storm the assembly. With the whole administration thrown into chaos, the brave men faced no resistance, and it was not long before Darnand addressed the nation over the radio.\nA nefarious plot, he declared, had unfolded this day. The communards, bankrolled and aided by the Jews and Freemasons not only of Algiers but of the entire world, and using Algerian nationalists as useful idiots, had conspired to kill Pétain. And just how close their plot had come to success, Darnand stated, only showed how complicit the political class was in this disgraceful plot against France itself. The liberals in the assembly, the Jews, the Masonic lodge of Algiers, the natives: every vile force opposed to the French Race had come together this day, and it was through his leadership and the glory of France alone that they had failed. Only a radical, indeed revolutionary, reorganisation of the French State, he announced, could save France from its foes. Shortly afterwards, having regained consciousness in hospital, a shaken Marshal Pétain confirmed Darnand as Premier."

As such, the Maréchal has appointed General Charles de Gaulle, a loyal member of Pétain's clique, as the new Premier of France. With his influence having been much strenghthened by the adoption of his proposals for the liberation of the métropole, de Gaulle's appointment has come as a surprise to few, and many in the country have high hopes for his adminstration."

natfra.30.d:0 "Since the declaration of Martial Law, Maréchal Pétain himself has ruled as both Premier and President. However, he has never been suited to day-to-day administration, and his duties as Head of State and military position leave him with little time for this anyway. As such, the Maréchal has appointed Admiral François Darlan, a loyal member of Pétain's clique, as the new Premier of France. With his influence having been much strenghthened by the adoption of his proposals for the liberation of the métropole, Darlan's appointment has come as a surprise to few, and many in the country have high hopes for his adminstration."
natfra.30.a:0 "Bonne chance, Monsieur le Premier!!"

natfra.31.t:0 "Finding Parliamentary Backers"
natfra.31.d:0 "As we seek to ensure lasting loyalty within the Assembly, and eventually make the body fully subordinate to the military government, we must deepen our ties with right-wing parties who can assist us. So far, the parties most friendly towards the junta have been Louis Marin's Fédération Républicaine, and François de la Rocque's Croix-de-Feu.\nThe FR, in spite of its Catholic and conservative policies, is deeply commited to Republicanism and democratic ideals, with the result that the more authoritarian members of Pétain's clique distrust it as overly liberal. Nonetheless, Marin has always supported the Junta, arguing that it is impossible to seek full democracy in the current circumstances, so doubling down on his support may well lend us legitimacy.\nOn the other hand, de la Rocque's party is far less commited to Parliamentarism and the Republic, but de la Rocque has long sought to cultivate a cult of personality which some fear could challenge Pétain's own, alongside his party's mass membership, a new innovation in French politics which troubles some traditionalists.\Nevertheless, we need allies, and due to the rivalry between the two parties we must settle on one of the two as our primary ally."
natfra.31.a:0 "Marin's Republicanism will appease democrats."
natfra.31.b:0 "De La Rocque's politics are far closer to our own."

natfra.32.t:0 "Parliament Stabilises"
natfra.32.d.marin:0 "After over a week of intense lobbying and campaigning by Louis Marin and his Fédération Républicaine, with generous support from the junta itself, the Assembly has passed a given into the pressure to pass a new law, giving Pétain, as President of the Republic, sweeping powers to move against dissidents and to reform the Republic.\nThis was largely seen as inevitable since Pétain's loyalists in the Army occupied the Assembly when Martial Law was first declared, but it is clear that Marin's renewed support for Pétain has also gone a long way to legitimise the Maréchal's consolidation of power. De la Rocque also sought to round up support for the recent law, but with Pétain having chosen to co-operate with his rival Marin instead, he has lost a significant amount of influence."

natfra.32.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.33.t:0 "Pétain's Speech"
natfra.33.d:0 "In his first major public appearance since Martial Law was declared, Philippe Pétain today declared that the old constitution of the Third Republic, long since discarded anyway, had, at least for the time being, conclusively failed, and that the recent turbulence was all the proof for this that anyone needed. As such, declared the Maréchal, the constitution shall be suspended, with the military assuming direct control over France, at least until the métropole is liberated and order is restored."
natfra.33.a:0 "A necessary measure to ensure strong government."

natfra.34.t:0 "Marin's Request"
natfra.34.d:0 "Having greatly aligned himself with the military junta since martial law was declared, and done a great deal to stabilise Pétain's government, Louis Marin is now asking for concessions in return.\nMarin has never sought to hide his republican and democratic ideals, and his Fédération Républicaine, in spite of its conservatism, is very much a Republican party. As such, the political grandee is now arguing that in order to further his own legitimacy, Pétain should clarify that the suspension of the Constitution is a provisional measure, and that the Republic will be restored after the Liberation."
natfra.34.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.34.b:0 "Who's this jumped-up civilian to order us around?"

natfra.35.t:0 "De La Rocque Seeks to Expand the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.35.d:0 "Having greatly aligned himself with the military junta since martial law was declared, and done a great deal to stabilise Pétain's government, François de la Rocque is now asking for concessions in return.\nHis Croix-de-Feu is a thoroughly new force in French politics, as it is the first ever party to seek to enlist a mass membership, with its own paramilitaries, women's associations, youth groups, and more besides. De la Rocque now argues that government funds to further expand his party would further strenghten the Junta's hand, and garner more legitimacy."
natfra.35.a:0 "This will only improve our popularity."
natfra.35.b:0 "We should be wary of de la Rocque's ambitions: reign him in."

natfra.36.t:0 "The Powers of the Army"
natfra.36.d:0 "Through the rule of Pétain, and by extension his many loyalists within the military, the army has essentially come to control National France. For years now our government has been very much a military junta, but now, with Pétain having greatly consolidated his power, his allies are divided on the extent to which the army's power should be recognised.\nMany believe that the normal of the institutions of the republic work fine, and we can simply maintain the junta bty appointing military men to key positions, as we have done before. However, others argue that the constitution is an opportunity for a more fundamental step away from civilian politics, and that we should formally give broad governmental powers to the institution of the Army itself."
natfra.36.a:0 "Give the army official powers in the administration."
natfra.36.b:0 "Just appoint military men to "civilian" posts."

natfra.37.t:0 "Political Stabilisation"
natfra.37.d:0 "With the Republican Constitution finally suspended and our civilian allies having done much to bolster our legitimacy, it is clear by now that the military junta has endured, with the protests against the government having thoroughly withered away, and politicians with dubious loyalty having either affirmed their support, or been dealt with.\nNow, with a freer hand and a clearer purpose, Pétain and his allies can lead France onwards, with the Maréchal declaring that only strong leadership and clear purpose can bring the nation to victory over the red traitors."
natfra.37.a:0 "Vive le Maréchal, et Vive la France!"

natfra.38.d.degaulle:0 "Since he was appointed as Premier when Martial Law was declared, General Charles de Gaulle has worked tirelessly to preserve the junta, and to restore its popularity and place in society. Meanwhile, as Chief of Staff he is fast becoming the most influential officer in the military, which is fast being reformed into the small, professional force that he envisaged.\nAs such, de Gaulle is now proposing to Pétain that, as Premier, he be given extended powers over day-to-day governance, and that more of his loyalists within the military be appointed to cabinet positions. While Pétain is deeply impressed by de Gaulle's service to the junta and to France, some worry that he may be becoming too influential."

natfra.38.a:0 "We can't trust his ambitions."
natfra.38.b:0 "He has proven his loyalty: very well."

natfra.39.t:0 "The Focus of the Chantiers de la Jeunesse"
natfra.39.d:0 "Now that we have established a program of "youth workshops", or camps for young men to stay at in order to learn loyalty and service to France, we must decide on what the main purpose of these camps will be. Many of Pétain's more conservative allies want the camps to focus on teaching the youth traditional values and strong morality, while other members of the junta would prefer for young men to mainly be taught support for the junta, and devotion to the Maréchal, in order to ensure the loyalty of the next generation. Many in the army, however, instead want the camps to mainly provide basic training and physical fitness programs, to prepare young men for military service."
natfra.39.a:0 "Teach the youth traditional morality."
natfra.39.b:0 "Teach them loyalty to Pétain."
natfra.39.c:0 "Focus on getting them fit for the army."

natfra.40.t:0 "Marianne et Maréchal"
natfra.40.d:0 "As Pétain's personality cult continues to grow, some of the old marshal's supporters have now begun replacing busts of Marianne, symbolic incarnation of freedom and thee Republic, with busts off Pétain himself. While the loyalty that this demonstrates is of course commendable, many of our more democratically-inclined citizens are concerned by this, fearing that it demonstrates that Pétain is sweeping away the Republic in its entirety, and the essence of France with it. As the controversy grows, we shall have to take a side."
natfra.40.a:0 "Pétain is a heroid patriot, what better symbol of the Republic is there than his image?"
natfra.40.b:0 "This is too far, politely ask our supporters for Marianne's busts to go back up."

natfra.41.t:0 "Criteria for Government Contracts"
natfra.41.d:0 "With the junta having resolved to further deepen its ties with French businessmen, knowing that their financial and material support is crucial for the liberation, we must decide on our criteria for awarding government contracts. Many within Pétain's clique believe that there are still too many democratic sympathisers in business for us to award contracts lightly, and that loyalty to Pétain should be our first concern. Others, however, argue that this will lead to inefficiency and corruption, and that we must award contractts fairly, even if it compromises our ideological consistency."
natfra.41.a:0 "There is no qualification more important than loyalty."
natfra.41.b:0 "Focus on their competence, not their politics."

natfra.42.t:0 "Allegations of Corruption"
natfra.42.d:0 "Over the past months, the junta has conspicuously tightened its bonds with various loyal businesses in National France. However, allegations are starting to surface in the less loyal elements of the press, and in simple rumours, of a blatant corruption that goes far beyond simply favouring the more supportive businessmen for contracts. Many within the government are urging Pétain to act quickly and crack down on any such behaviour, lest we see a repeat of the Janin scandal. However, others point out that times have changed since then, and that we are now in a better position to simply crush the rumours before they become embarrassing."
natfra.42.a:0 "We don't need to worry about public outcry any more: crush the sedition."
natfra.43.b:0 "This could become a problem, introduce anti-corruption campaigns."

natfra.43.t:0 "Democratic Sympathisers Gain Government Contracts"
natfra.43.d:0 "With the junta having disregarded loyalty to Pétain in favour of competence in the process to gain government contracts, an unsettling trend has emerged of businessmen gaining contracts whose previous political records are far from attractive to Pétain's loyalists. Many men who had previously given large funds to liberal parties, and in some cases had even publicly citicised the government, are now working on vital projects for the state. This could be deeply embarrassing for us if it gets out, and could leave the junta vulnerable: after all, who knows what contacts they still maintain with enemies of the government? Before this gets any further, we must settle our stance towards this problem."
natfra.43.a:0 "If they still wanted to bring down Pétain they wouldn't be working for him: leave them be."
natfra.43.b:0 "Tighten vetting requirements for loyalty to the junta."

natfra.44.t:0 "Revival of Great War History"
natfra.44.d:0 "As the junta further consolidates its power, many sympathetic intellectuals and scholars have started promoting a revival of the history of the Great War, with a large number of new assesments of the conflict having recently been released. Notably, these books emphasise the competence and succeses of France's officer corps, not least Pétain himself, and the bravery of common soldiers. Such a celebration of the French military thus leaves the blame for defeat with the civilian politicians of the war, who are accused of having doomed France through their infighting and weakness, an accusation that chimes well with Pétain's own rhetoric about the divisive and weak nature of parliamentary democracy. In all, this new historical trend is a triumph for the junta's image and prestige."
natfra.44.a:0 "Hurrah!"

natfra.45.t:0 "How to Celebrate Pétain?" 
natfra.45.d:0 "Now that we are seeking to bolster the existing cult of personality around Maréchal Pétain, some debate has arisen among the regimes propagandists as to what exactly he should be celebrated for. All agree that a consistent narrative is key to effective propaganda, but what that narrative should put emphasis on is disputed, with some wanting us to focus on Pétain's devout Catholicism and patriotism, and others believing that it would be more effective amidst a tense global situation to remind the people of his heroism and successes during the Great War."
natfra.45.a:0 "Emphasise his military successes."
natfra.45.b:0 "Emphasise his faith and patriotism."

natfra.46.t:0 "The Extent of Desecularisation"
natfra.46.d:0 "As we seek to ally with the Catholic Church in order to further our traditionalist policies and bolster the junta's support, we will have to end the deep secularism of the Third Republic to gain good relations with the Church. However, the government is divided over how far we should go in desecularising France. Many believe that it would be simplest to just repeal the legislation which has up to now repressed the Catholic Church. However, others, Charles de Gaulle notable among them, are now stating that the time has come to go further, and outright restore Roman Catholicism as the state relgiion of France."
natfra.46.a:0 "We need State Catholicism to guide the people forward."
natfra.46.b:0 "Removing anti-Catholic laws is enough to please the Church."

natfra.47.t:0 "Pétain and the Pope"
natfra.47.d:0 "With Roman Catholicism having been enshrined some months ago as the state religion of France, President Pétain today made a state visit to Rome. After meeting with [ITA.GetLeader], and ensuring promises of further economic co-operation and friendship, Pétain made his way to the Vatican, where he met with the Pope. The two men, official reports state, discussed personal matters of faith, before Pétain assured His Holiness that National France would always be ready to protect the Holy See, and his government would do all it could to protect the Church and its followers, not only in France but arounf the world."
natfra.47.a:0 "With the support of His Holiness, nobody can stop us!"

natfra.48.t:0 "The Ideology of the Révolution Nationale"
natfra.48.d:0 "With Pétain having now announced a "national revolution" to sweep away all that has so far held France and its people back, and stating that this will be the ideological basis of his regime, we must now claarify what this ideology in fact promotes. Pétain's old friends within the army largely want us to centre it around militarism and French nationalism, while the Catholic conservatives whom Pétain has more recently aligned would prefer a program of traditionalism and morality. Others, meanwhile, believe we should simply centre our "ideology" around Pétain himself, and use it as an extension of his cult of personality."
natfra.48.a:0 "Militarism and nationalism will restore glory to France!"
natfra.48.b:0 "Only a moral people under God stands a chance of liberating the patrie!"
natfra.48.c:0 "Pétain alone knows what is best for the nation!"

natfra.49.t:0 "Support from the Archbishop of Algiers"
natfra.49.d:0 "Today, in front of his large congregation, Auguste-Fernand Leynaud, Archbishop of Algiers, called on all French Catholics to strive for the liberation of their homeland and of their Catholic brothers and sisters, currently suffering under Communard tyranny. Although many Catholics were disappointed by Pétain's reluctance to fully restore Catholicism as the state religion, Leynaud's excellent sermon has gone a long way to helping Pétain build a support base among conservative Catholics."
natfra.49.a:0 "Excellent!"

natfra.50.t:0 "Darnand Breaks with the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.50.d:0 "François de la Rocque's Catholic corporatist Croix-de-Feu, a major ally of the junta in the Assembly, today suffered a significant setback. The party has long been a broad-tent coalition, united mainly by de la Rocque's own charisma and by a shared distrust for liberal democracy. However, the tensions caused by this have clearly reached a boiling point, with some of the party's hardliners under Joseph Darnand, splitting off entirely to form a new "Chevaliers du Glaive" party.\nClaiming inspiration from the legionaries in Romania, and seeking to defend French racial purity and restore French power in Europe, Darnand has notably proclaimed his absolute loyalty to the Pétain government, in what we can only assume is a ploy for influence in the junta. Nevertheless, Darnand's group remains on the extreme fringe, and his radicalism is regarded with suspicion by much of the population, while Pétain's allies in the junta have no interest in working with him. If anything, his split from the Croix-de-Feu has harmed de la Rocque through exposing the divisions in his own party, more than it has helped Darnand."
natfra.50.a:0 "We can safely ignore this lunatic."

natfra.51.t:0 "The End of the Republic"
natfra.51.d:0 "Over the past weeks, the junta has been greatly stabilised, buoyed by the backing of the Action Française both in its newspaper and on the streets. This has come, however, at a dear price, and it seems that the royalists have finally gotten their way.\nAs such, Philippe Pétain today announced, flanked by prominent members of the AF, that the Third Republic, having been proven by the defeat in the Great War, the revolution, and now the fall of Janin to be unworkable, was no more. In its place, to seek true unity and revive the genuine spirit of France, the Orléans monarchy would be restored under Jean, Duc de Guise.\nAlthough most commentators saw this coming when the junta and AF began collaborating, it has nevertheless came as a great shock to the nation, and most Frenchmen barely know what to make of such a seismic political shift. Nevertheless, the dominant mood appears to be relief that the crisis is over, and a hope that the monarchy will lead to the political stabilisation and deeper unity needed to free the métropole."
natfra.51.a:0 "A new dawn for the nation."

natfra.52.t:0 "The Coronation"
natfra.52.d:0 "Today in Algiers, all the dreams of the Action Française and of French royalism were at last realised. In a long and elaborate ceremony, Jean d'Orléans was crowned King of France, with as many ancient rites and rituals as the circumstances of exile made possible. Notably, however, the new King did not swear, as his ancestors did, to fight infidels, owing to the AF's alliance with Arab groups, and the need to maintain the loyalty of the largely Muslim native population.\nAfter the coronation was finished, Jean met in private with both Philippe Pétain and Charles Maurras, apparently discussing the future governance of France with the monarchy back in place."
natfra.52.a:0 "Vive le Roi!"

natfra.53.t:0 "The King's Cabinet"
natfra.53.d:0 "Today, after some days of political wrangling presided over by the King, a new government for the resurrected Kingdom was at last agreed. Philippe Pétain's previous role as Head of State has been made redundant by the monarchy, and he has instead accepted to become Minister of War, while Charles Maurras becomes Premier in his place, and prominent cabinet roles are filled by loyal AF men.\nIn practice, the message is clear: the military junta, which has dominated French politics since 1919, is no more. Although many saw this coming as Pétain became more and more dependent on Maurras to prop up his rule, such a sudden departure from power has nonetheless astonished many. However, by 1936 most Frenchmen had become disgruntled with military rule, not incorrectly seeing the junta as more and more corrupt and stagnant. Although Maurras is far from universally liked either, he has a strong and growing support base, and most of the country only hopes that he can do a better job than his predecessors."
natfra.53.a:0 "Maurras will lead the nation on to greatness!"

natfra.54.t:0 "The Purpose of the Camelots du Roi"
natfra.54.d:0 "Now that we have resolved to deepen the role of the Camelots du Roi within the government, we must settle on a clearer purpose for the movement. So far, under Maurice Pujo, the Camelots have formally been considered a youth group, but in practice have more closely resembled a political paramilitary, with young men in the organisation often engaging in street fights with members of opposing parties and protecting AF politicians. Many now believe that such an organisation is vital for the government to hold on to power, but others believe that reforming it into a genuine youth group would also be a succesful policy."
natfra.54.a:0 "We need the loyalty of the next generation: reform it into a youth movement."
natfra.54.b:0 "The opposition is still a threat, keep it as it is."

natfra.55.t:0 "Controlling the Streets"
natfra.55.d:0 "Since we formalised the Camelots du Roi's possition as a political paramilitary, the organisation has been indispensible in maintaining order around the country. In every major city, loyal Camelots can frquently be seen keeping watch on the streets, and have been vital in rounding up undesirables and dissidents, and impressing the strength of the new government on ordinary people. This assertion of government power has done much to stabilise our regime, greatly encouraging Pujo and the rest of the AF leadership."
natfra.55.a:0 "We salute their courage."

natfra.56.t:0 "Royalist Youth Camps"
natfra.56.d:0 "Over the past weeks, the Camelots du Roi have been reformed into a genuine youth movement, with their more paramilitary members re-assigned to the growing secret police, and boys around the country enrolled. Now, youth camps are opening around the country, funded and supported by the state. These institutions will teach the youth of the naton true moral values, alongside dedication to the King and rrespect for the hierarchies of soceity."
natfra.56.a:0 "An excellent initiative!"

natfra.57.t:0 "The Republican Intellectuals"
natfra.57.d:0 "As we consolidate power and restore the Orléans monarchy to its rightful place, we must deal with the philosophers, writers, political theorists, and other dubious "intellectuals" who were prominent supporters of the Republic. Although it goes without saying that their writings and theories must be suppressed, many in the government woudld also like to see these seiditious figures locked up, while others argue that they can do no harm by themselves, and leaving them be would avoid controversy."
natfra.57.a:0 "I want these pseudo-intellectuals behind bars!"
natfra.57.b:0 "They're not a threat if we stamp out their literature."

natfra.58.t:0 "The Fate of the Politicians"
natfra.58.d:0 "The Third Republuc was home to an extensive and burgeoning ruling class, and now, as we work to dismantle it, we must decide on its fate. Hardliners with the  goveernent righhtlly blame these men for the weakness and failings of the Repubic, and for promoting horrific decadence, but some moderates believe that, with their political parties dissolved and influence no more, they can be no threat to us, and that taking more action against them would only lead to condemnation."
natfra.58.a:0 "They're all corrupt scum, we can't take any chances."
natfra.58.b:0 "They aren't able to challenge us any more, leave them alone."

natfra.59.t:0 "The Future of Parliament"
natfra.59.d:0 "Opposition to parliamentary power, and to the parliamentarian establishment, has always been integral to Maurras's ideology. Now that we are in power, however, we need a practical solution to the problem of parliament, for which Maurras has received two proposals. The orthodox view within the AF is that the Assembly should be abolished outright, though some believe that it would now be more politically expedient to reduce it to an advisory body, devoid of much power but useful to maintain confidence in the government."
natfra.59.a:0 "We have no need for such a worthless body."
natfra.59.b:0 "They'll do fine as an advisory institution."

natfra.60.t:0 "A Classical Curriculum"
natfra.60.d:0 "With Maurras's government having commited to promote a revival of classical culture and ideals, it is essential that the youth learn these principles. As such, a new education law has been passed, establishing a new curriculum for students in France. From now on, classical languages, philosophy, and history will be greatly elevated in the curriculum, and become compulsory for every child. By instilling in the youth the values of the ancient world, we will doubtless restore its greatness."
natfra.60.a:0 "There is nothing better to learn."

natfra.61.t:0 "The Future of Immigration"
natfra.61.d:0 "The Action Française has always staunvhly opposed immigration, identifying unassimilated immigrants, or, in Athenian terminology, "metics" as one of the "four confederated estates" of the Anti-France. However, the party is now divided over how exactly to solve the problem of immigration. One proposal, inspired by Maurras's emphasis on Mediterranean civilisation, is to restrict immigration to those from Latin countries. On the other hand, some within the government believe we should ignore national origin, provided that all immigrants are made to assimilate into French culture and only small numbers are taken in. Others, meanwhile, want to end immigration outright"
natfra.61.a:0 "Limit it to Latin countries."
natfra.61.b:0 "Managed numbers and assimilation will do fine."
natfra.61.c:0 "End it entirely."

natfra.62.t:0 "The Fate of Protestant Missionaries"
natfra.62.d:0 "Protestantism, the religion of the German filth and an affront to the essentially Latin hierarchies of the Catholic Church, has long been identified as a key part of the Anti-France by Maurras. Thankfully, the African territories have no substantial Protestant population which could threaten our government, but there are nonetheless many Protestant missionaries, especially in the Sub-Saharan colonies. Although many want us to stamp out these seditious preachers lest they turn the natives against us, many of the missionaries are Anglicans supported by our English and Canadian allies, so some are urging us to pragmatically leave them be, lest the Entente Cordiale is strained unduely."
natfra.62.a:0 "Leave them alone, we should avoid upsetting the Canadians."
natfra.62.b:0 "The Canadians need our ships and troops more than a few Priests."

natfra.63.t:0 "Combatting Freemasonry"
natfra.63.d:0 "Freemasonry, as a highly secretive international network which stands opposed to the Classical ideals of the Action Française, has aways drawn the party's ire, and is identified by Maurras as one of the four estates of the Anti-France. It goes without saying that the time has come to shut down the Masonic lodges around our territory, and to ban the practice.\nMany of course would like to go further still, and take this opportunity to round up known Freemasons, as well as uncovering those who have kept their affiliations hidden: many have associated with or supported liberal movements, and with Masonry banned none of them will sympathise with us now. Others, however, argue that such an operation would be extremely costly, and it's always possible that we could simply fail to find much evidence against them."
natfra.63.a:0 "Banning Masonic activity from now on will be enough."
natfra.63.b:0 "We can take no chances: round up known Masons and expose the others."

natfra.64.t:0 "The Crémieux Decree Repealed"
natfra.64.d:0 "Now that we have largely dealt with France's other enemies, we can turn to what many view as the most insidious of all her foes: the Jews. The Action Française came into being amidst the Dreyfus Affair, and Maurras's ideology has always criticised their influence over France. In Algeria, meanwhile, all Jews have been French citizens for decades now, something that has consistently drawn anger and resentment from the natives.\nBut no more: today, His Majesty formally repealed the Crémieux Decree, which first granted citizenship to the Jews of Algeria. Natives around the country have celebrated the news, and Maurras's allies in Ferhat Abbas's AF-inspired Action Algerienne have congratulated the government, and promised to reedouble their efforts to improve co-operation betweem Arabs and Frenchmen."
natfra.64.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.65.t:0 "Aristocratic Restorations"
natfra.65.d:0 "The French aristocracy, in spite of its long and proud history, has long been humiliated and repressed by the Republic. However, this can go on no longer: the aristocracy has a vital role to play within Maurras's ideal of an orderly, hierarchical society, and French aristocrats are almost universally monarchist, and generally sympathetic to the AF. As such, the government has set about restoring legal recognition of aristocratic titles, and with it restoring the French peerage, to ensure a loyal and organic government."
natfra.65.a:0 "Let the nobility resume its good work for the nation!"

natfra.66.t:0 "Pogroms in Algiers"
natfra.66.d:0 "In the aftermath of the repeal of the Crémieux Decree, anti-Semitic sentiment has been galvanised in Algeria, both among Arab nationalists who have long resented the special treatment of Jews and Frenchmen sympathetic to Maurras's rhetoric.\nAlthough most Jews are now leaving the country, for Germany, Palestine, or even the Commune, those that are stayed are increasingly being attacked, with anti-Jewish demonstrations increasingly common. These are now descending into violence, something that most integralists have little objection to, and thus many believe the government should endorse the demonstrations. However, some in the government are worried about international condemnation, and thus urge us to reign in the demonstrators before it grows out of hand."
natfra.66.a:0 "Their complaints are justified: encourage them."
natfra.66.b:0 "Put a lid on it now before it becomes embarassing."

natfra.67.t:0 "Breaking up High Finance"
natfra.67.d:0 "For too long, the rootless and corrupt agents of global finance have sought to enslave people around the world, separating them from faith, culture, and tradition. Now, however, we can begin to put a stop to this: today, by order of the King, the assets of countless prominent banks and non-French businessmen were seized.\nNow that the state is in control of their wealth and businesses, we must decide what to do with them. Some believe that we should redistribute it to loyal Frenchmen, while others argue that to prevent another spiral into corruption, the state must maintain control over these businesses, and can spend the money on new projects."
natfra.67.a:0 "Give it to patriotic Frenchmen."
natfra.67.b:0 "Maintain state control."

natfra.68.t:0 "Supporting Native Elites"
natfra.68.d:0 "In order to entrench acceptance of French rule, the government has moved to extend Maurras's ideals of localism and decentralised government to Africa, consolidating the longstanding alliance between French colonial rule and native monarchs and chiefs. As such, we must find a place for these native leaders.\nSome within the government believe that it would be fitting to make them Peers of the Realm, on an equal footing to French aristocrats, while others believe it would be better to give them nominal self-governance over their lands, on the condition of loyalty to the French Crown."
natfra.68.a:0 "Make them French noblemen within the Kingdom."
natfra.68.b:0 "Give them autonomy in exchange for loyalty to France."

natfra.69.t:0 "An Offer from de Gaulle"
natfra.69.d:0 "General Charles de Gaulle, despite not being an active supporter of the Action Française, has nevertheless had monarchist sympathies for some time, seeing a King as a positive figure for national unity, and has also had some admiration of Maurras. As such, he was notable in his enthusiasm at the Restoration, and has been instrumental in encouraging his colleagues in the army, particularly his mentor, Pétain, to accept the new state of affairs.\nNow, de Gaulle has reached out to the AF, asking that, in his capacity as Chief of Staff, he be given increased powers to control the Armed Forces, and be further included in government decisions on national defence, foreign policy, and military spending, in practice bringing him into the Cabinet.\nMost of the AF is pleased at his sympathies for the government, and is enthusiastic at the idea, though others argue that he deviates too far from the party's ideology to be trusted."
natfra.69.a:0 "Bring him into the government, we need allies."
natfra.69.b:0 "We can do without moderates in powerful positions."

natfra.70.t:0 "Winning Over the Church"
natfra.70.d:0 "With the Action Française having greatly consolidated its position as the French government, one last major obstacle remains: the Catholic Church. Although Catholic conservatives have historically been supportive of French monarchism, and the AF's rhetoric has favoured State Catholicism, relations with the Church have been regrettably strained by the fact that Maurras, and many other prominent figures in the AF, are agnostic. Maurras's support for State Catholicism, meanwhile, comes from his admiration for the Church's hierarchy, which he sees as embodying the hierarchies of Latin civilisation, and his belief that shared Catholicism would help hold France together.\nThis has always been percieved as opportunistic and cynical by the Church, and, although the anti-Clerical policies of the Commune have caused the Papacy to restrain itself from openly condemning the AF, the Church has little love for our government, and has beeen greatly reluctant to support us after our coming to power.\nOf course, this situation must be remedied, something for which we have recieved three proposals. Many believe that if Maurras and others could convert to Caholicism, and renounce their earlier disparaging comments about Christianity, the Church will be placated. On the other hand, many believe that an offer to defend the Church from the syndicalist menace would bring them around. Others, meanwhile, argue that we should simply remind the Church of the Commune's anti-clericalism, and of our support fot State Catholicism, opportunistic or otherwise, to present ourselves as a lesser evil."
natfra.70.a:0 "If Maurras joins the Church, they'll have nothing to complain about."
natfra.70.b:0 "An offer to defend the Papacy can hardly be refused."
natfra.70.c:0 "Remind the Church that the Communards will be worse than us."

natfra.71.t:0 "Charles Maurras Joins the Church"
natfra.71.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, Maurras has converted to Roman Catholicism. This goes a long way to placating our prior worries about the AF, and many now believe that we should improve relations with the French exiles, and work towards signing a new Concordat."
natfra.71.a:0 "Very well, let's reach out to the French."
natfra.71.b:0 "Maurras's conversion is as opportunistic as his earlier writings."

natfra.72.t:0 "An Offer from the French"
natfra.72.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, French diplomats have contacted us with an offer to protect us from the Italian socialists, in exchange for the Church softening its relations with the AF and working towards a concordat. Although many believe that this would be a betrayal of our principles, the dominant view in the Church is that Maurras is by far a lesser evil compared to the Syndicalists, and that State Catholicism, even if the reasons for it are opportunistic, is far better than socialist anti-clericalism."
natfra.72.a:0 "Very well, let's reach out to the French."
natfra.72.b:0 "We can't sell out like this."

natfra.73.t:0 "An Message from the French"
natfra.73.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, French diplomats have contacted us, stating that they are aware of and understand the Church's concerns about the Maurras government, but that the blatant anti-clericalism of the Commune would be far worse, and it is in the interests of the Church and of French Catholics that we soften relations with the AF, and work towards signing a concordat. Although some are sypathetic to this message, many believe that accepting the AF's suggestions would be a betrayal of the Church's principles, especially given that the AF has not offered to do anything in exchange."
natfra.73.a:0 "They're a lesser evil compared to the Commune, we should reach out to them."
natfra.73.b:0 "We can't trust Maurras."

natfra.74.t:0 "The Church Accepts"
natfra.74.d:0 "Excellent news has reached Algiers today, as the Holy See has accepted our diplomatic advances, and announced its intention to sign a Concordat with the government of the Kingdom. It seems that what concessions we offered them have paid off, and that they have accepted the fact that we are far better for French Catholics than the Communards ever could be. This will greatly strengthen the hand of the government, as many conservative Catholics once skeptical about the AF will come around to us."
natfra.74.a:0 "Brilliant!"

natfra.75.t:0 "The Church Refuses"
natfra.75.d:0 "Disappointing news has reached Algiers today, as the Holy See has refused our diplomatic advances, seemingly unimpressed by the fact that we would be a better government for French Catholics than the atheistic Commune, and not interested in the concessions we offered. This may greatly weaken the AF government in the long term, as the support conservative Catholics will be even further out of reach, and many of our political allies in the military or other monarchist groups, and even the royal family themselves, may lose confidence in the government."
natfra.75.a:0 "A disaster!"

natfra.76.t:0 "An Offer From Deloncle"
nfa.76.d:0 "With more moderate royalist sympathisers such as de Gaulle increasingly sidelined, we have been approached with a new offer of collaboration from Eugène Deloncle, a former member of the Action Française who became disillusioned with Maurras's inaction in the years before we came to power, and who grew more sympathetic to newer nationalist ideals prevalent in Italy, Romania, Russia, and elsewhere.\nNow, however, Deloncle appears enthusiastic at the death of the republic and restoration of the monarchy, and, in spite of his differences, is willing to work with our government.\nHe does indeed appear to have a lot to offer us: he seemingly has contacts throughout the military and intelligence services, and many likeminded loyalists willing to aid him. In exchange for some political influence and concessions, Deloncle claims, he will be able to use his connections to pacify what remains of the opposition, and even infiltrate the Commune."
natfra.76.a:0 "He could be a valuable ally, give him the go-ahead."
natfra.76.b:0 "We can't trust this terrorist."

natfra.77.t:0 "The Colonel's Coalition"
natfra.77.d:0 "Having been appointed Premier by Maréchal Pétain to restore confidence in the regime and rebuild popular support, François de la Rocque now needs to find political allies, if he is to have any chance of consolidating power. As such, he today announced on the steps of the Assembly that he and his cabinet would work towards forming a new government of national unity, intended to bridge political divides and reunite the nation, alongside an anti-corruption push.\nIt is expected that this initiative will be supported by Pétain's other allies in parliament, such as Louis Marin's Fédération Républicain, and many have pinned their hopes for a restoration of order and unity onto de la Rocque. President Pétain as well is said to have high hopes for his new premier, though some of his loyalists worry that de la Rocque's power and popularity is eclipsing Pétain's own, and that his political maneouverings lack presidential oversight."
natfra.77.a:0 "We'll need to find allies..."

natfra.78.t:0 "Marin Joins the Unity Government"
natfra.78.d:0 "After many smaller nationalist and conservative parties and independents pledged their support of de la Rocque's unity government, today Louis Marin, leader of the conservative and Catholic, but avwoedly republican, Fédération Républicain, did the same, assuring de la Rocque of the support of his party. Although Marin himself hopes to amass influence for himself and his party within de la Rocque's government, many predict that his alliance with the Croix-de-Feu will simply see his movement absorbed and eclipsed."
natfra.78.a:0 "Only time will tell."

natfra.79.t:0 "The Special Premieral Powers Act"
natfra.79.d:0 "With de la Rocque's unity government having absorbed the smaller rightwing parties, the Fédératon Républicain, and many delegates from the Alliance Démocratique, there was little opposition today when he passed through the Assemvly a new Special Premieral Powers Act. The Act expands on the State of Emergency declared by Foch in 1919, giving the Premier special powers to enforce the State of Emergency and to maintain order.\nIn practice, this has concentrated extraordinary power in de la Rocque, and it is clearly him, not Pétain or anybody else, who is in control. The nation only waits to see what he will do with his newfound control over the state."
natfra.79.a:0 "We can trust the Colonel."

natfra.80.d.degaulle:0 "Over the past months, the acceptance of Charles de Gaulle's proposals for military reform has propelled him to a position of great influence within Pétain's clique, and, by extension, within the government. As such, it is vital to secure his loyalty.\nWith this in mind, de la Rocuqe today met with the General, his fellow Great War veteran, and a man who shares many of his Catholic and nationalistic beliefs, in spite of de Gaulle's past sympathies for monarchism.\nThe two men were able to find much common ground, and de Gaulle has agreed to support the civilianisation of the junta under the Croix-de-Feu, in exchange for greater investment in the army, and greater autonomy for the general staff."
natfra.80.d.darlan:0 "Over the past months, the acceptance of François Darlan's proposals for military reform has propelled him to a position of great influence within Pétain's clique, and, by extension, within the government. As such, it is vital to secure his loyalty.\nWith this in mind, de la Rocuqe today met with the Admiral, his fellow Great War veteran, whose rapid rise through the French navy during the 1920s and 1930s, and involvment with Pétain, has caused him to develop nationalistic and anti-parliamentarian ideas shared by de la Rocque.\nThe two men were able to find much common ground, and Darlan has agreed to support the civilianisation of the junta under the Croix-de-Feu, in exchange for greater investment in the army, and greater autonomy for the general staff."
natfra.80.a:0 "We would be nothing without the heroes of the military."

natfra.81.t:0 "Our Friends in Business"
natfra.81.d:0 "Throughout the Croix-de-Feu's history, the party has been supported by many patriotic and right-leaning businessman, and in its early days the party depended entirely on financial support from the succesful perfumer François Coty. De la Rocque has always maintained good relations with the business community since, and Coty for his part has already been rewarded with the post of Minister of Finance.\nHowever, de la Rocque has many backers beyond Coty himself, and they all want something in return for their donations and support. De la Rocque is of course grateful for their contributions, and is eager to repay them somehow, but many of his advisers, and the remaining military men in the government, believe that bringing loyal businessmen into the government en masse would likely be seen as corrupt."
natfra.81.a:0 "Their loyalty has been essential: reward them with government positions."
natfra.81.b:0 "We don't want to be seen as corrupt, just favour them for contracts."

natfra.82.t:0 "Allegations of Corruption"
natfra.82.d:0 "Over the past months, several wealthy businessmen have recieved notable government posts, something that has not gone unnoticed. The remaining newspapers that have submitted to neither us nor the old junta have printed embarrassing details of longstanding Croix-de-Feu supporters being given favourable contracts and government jobs, while other businessmen are overlooked.\nDe la Rocque's allies in the business community, whose reputations have been harmed even more than de la Rocque's, are urging the Colonel to stamp out the dissent now, before we have to deal with a repeat of the earlier protests.\nOn the other hand, many of the Colonel's allies in the party and military believe that it would be more effective and sustainable to launch anti-corruption campaings, restoring public confidence in the regime, and  preventing us from growing too dependent on big business."
natfra.82.a:0 "Crush the rumours before this becomes an issue."
natfra.82.b:0 "Win them over with anti-corruption measures."

natfra.83.t:0 "Coty's Complaints"
natfra.83.d:0 "Over the past months, several wealthy businessmen have been greatly disappointed by the government's refusal to give them overtly favourable treatment, in spite of their past support for the Croix-de-Feu. Although François Coty has continued to do well, and remains influential in his post as Finance Minister, he has grown frustrated by the treatment of his fellow businessmen and political allies, and is now demanding greater concessions to big business.\nMany of de la Rocque's allies believe that we should accept Coty's demands without guaranteeing as many concessions as he might have wanted earlier, but others argue that by continuing to reject his and his allies' advances, we can finally break free from the influence of big business."
natfra.83.a:0 "Make some concessions to keep them happy."
natfra.83.b:0 "The state does not exist to serve only the wealthy!"

natfra.84.t:0 "The Enemy Within"
natfra.84.d:0 "For years now, the Croix-de-Feu has staunchly opposed the influence of "hidden socialism", claiming the existence of a vast socialist conspiracy against the French nation and its leaders, and arguing that the Maréchal's government has been inflitrated and betrayed by Communard sympathisers.\nNow, on the back of the Special Premieral Powers Act, Colonel de la Rocque today pushed through the Assembly, with the support of a clear majority, the Special Counter-Socialist Measures Act, giving the government and Deuxieme Bureau extensive powers to investigate and crush syndicalist infiltration.\nWith the valiant officers of the law already setting to work cracking down on socialist spies and their Arab nationalist puppets, the nation will be made secure in no time."
natfra.84.a:0 "Justice will be served."

natfra.85.t:0 "The Radicaux Exposed"
natfra.85.d:0 "Today, a shocking truth came to light, thanks to the determined work of the Deuxieme Bureau. The Parti Radical, supposedly a safe and well-intentioned Republican party, has been thoroughly infiltrated by Communard agents ever since the exile.\It has always been well-known that the Party splintered at the tie of the revolution, with its left wing staying on in the Commune, but what has been kept hidden up to now is that the party leadership has maintained contacts with their former colleagues in the métropole ever since. The security implications of this are, of course, horrendous, and the pa's leadership is being rounded up and questioned, with both Cammille Chautemps and Édouard Daladier already behind bars and their party soon to be dissolved.\nAs we seek to pick up the pieces of this shocking revelation, we can only hope that their co-conspirators are soon found and dealt with."
natfra.85.a:0 "Ban this insidious party!"

natfra.86.t:0 "Dealing with the Action Française"
natfra.86.d:0 "As we continue to investigate Communard infiltration, the plot has only thickened, and it appears that the right has been as thoroughly manipulated as the left.\nGeorges Valois and his Cercle Proudhon were close to the Action Française, and to Charles Maurras himself, before the revolution, and it appears that they never really fell out, with many AF men found to have maintained contacts with members of Valois's "Sorelian" movement in the Commune, allowing sensitive information to reach the reds in Paris.\nMaurras, Pujo, and several other prominent AF politicians have been rounded up by the police, and the party's membership is ouraged at their leaders' treachery, and will likely now turn to the Croix-de-Feu itself as the true party of French nationalism."
natfra.86.a:0 "I want these traitors behind bars!"

natfra.87.t:0 "The Whole Truth"
natfra.87.d:0 "As politicians and parties across the political spectrum have been investigated and exposed for their connections to the Commune, it has become clear that some malicious individuals must have co-ordinated and covered up these efforts. Given how long this infiltrationhas gone on for, such individuals can only be exceptionally high-up in the government.\nAs such, countless longstanding aides and advisors to Phillipe Pétain have been rounded up, and are currently under investigation as we seek to find the Communard agents among them.\nIn practice, this has left Pétain cut off from many of his nominal loyalists. The Maréchal's public appearances have lately declined anyway, and with de la Rocque having forged his own alliances with the army, and in control of the Assmebly, many now wonder how much power Pétain really has."
natfra.87.a:0 "De la Rocque will save the nation from these saboteurs!"

natfra.88.t:0 "An Arab Wing"
natfra.88.d:0 "As we seek to further expand the mass party of the Croix-de-Feu, a proposal has reached de la Rocque that we create a new wing of the party, to represent the Arab population in Algeria. Especially as we attack the Action Française, which had some sympathy among the natives, and as we only tighten the taxation and conscription of Algerians in anticipation of the liberation, many believe it would be politically expedient to win their loyalty, though others argue that it would be a waste of funfs, and in practice largely futile."
natfra.88.a:0 "We need the Algerians' support, go ahead."
natfra.88.b:0 "We can't spare the money for this endeavour."

natfra.89.t:0 "Incentivising Party Membership"
natfra.89.d:0 "As the government seeks to bolster membership of the Croix-de-Feu, it will be essential to ensure that party memberhsip is common among civil servants, and other government employees. One proposal to encourage membership is to give party members subtle pay rises, and to make this practice an open secret, inspiring people to join. On the other hand, it has been suggested that party members could be favoured for promotions, and for government jobs in the first place. Meanwhile, we could also simply make mebership a legal requirement, though this would likely cause some controversy."
natfra.89.a:0 "Increase the salary of known members."
natfra.89.b:0 "Give members better opportunities for promotions and employment."
natfra.89.c:0 "Make membership mandatory."

natfra.90.t:0 "Enshrining Corporatism"
natfra.90.d:0 "Colonel de la Rocque, with the backing of all that remains of the Assembly, and the acceptance of the increasingly isolated Maréchal, has now commited to creating a new constitution for the French nation, to better organise it for the liberation and beyond.\nThe first step in establishing the new legal framework for the Colonel's state has, to the surprise of few, been the official establishment of a Corporatist system of government.\nThe first part of the constitution to be agreed on and ratified by the government has established a system of collective management of businesses, with unions controlled by the state, and the representation of unions and government officials on company boards, to ensure fait and collective management of industry."
natfra.90.a:0 "This will ensure stability better than any market or revolution."

natfra.91.t:0 "The Presidential State"
natfra.91.d:0 "As the drafting of the constitution continues, the government has now agreed upon the system of government that it will enshrine: a Catholic and Presidential republic.\nEver since Foch took over the government in 1919, the Republic has seen governmental power concentrated in the Presidency, but so far Pétain has had to operate through unofficial or pseudo-legal means.\nHowever, some wonder if he will ever make use of these new and extensive powers: the old Maréchal's public appearances have grown more and more infrequent, and he seems to have little to no influence on the drafting of what is being widely called the "Colonel's Constitution"."
natfra.91.a:0 "Only strong leadership can save France."

natfra.92.t:0 "A Social Republic"
natfra.92.d:0 "Today, by a unanimous vote of the Assembly, the new Constitution of the newly-christened République Sociale Française was adopted, and signed into law by President Pétain. The constitution formally adopts the conservative, Catholic, and corporatist agenda of the Croix-de-Feu, creating a Presidential corporate state.\nHowever, far from stregnthening the current President, this constitution has finally brought his political career to an end. After ratifying the constitution, Maréchal Pétain cofirmed that he was retiring from political and military life, to the unanimous applause and gratitude of the Assembly.\nIt had been no secret that de la Rocque had gradually stripped away Pétain's influence since becoming Premier, but the retirement of the man who has dominated French politics since 1929 has still come as a surprise to many, though most of the population hopes that fresh leaderhsip will strengthen the country.\nFrançois de la Rocque was soon declared Pétain's succesor as President, and in a long and succesful speech vowed to do his upmost to liberate France."
natfra.92.a:0 "Adieu Pétain, et Bienvenue de la Rocque!"

natfra.93.t:0 "The Old Union Officials"
natfra.93.d:0 "Now that the government has assumed control over the trade unions and re-organised them into the CSPF, we must decide what to do with the officials of the old independent trade unions. Although we cannot deny their organisational skill and experience, these men were largely aligned with the Parti Radical or Parti Républicain-Socialiste, both of which have long had poor relations with de la Rocque.\nAs such,we must decide what to do with these men. Some believe that they should be given jobs equivalent to their old positions in exchange for loyalty, while others believe that we should tightly vet them. Others, meanwhile, argue that we should simply get rid of them all."
natfra.93.a:0 "Let them stay on if they swear loyalty."
natfra.93.b:0 "Tightly vet them for socialist sympathies."
natfra.93.c:0 "We can't trust any of them."

natfra.94.t:0 "What to do with Pétain?"
natfra.94.d:0 "Over a month has passed since Pétain, having seen his political influence slowly swept away from under his feet, resigned the Presidency to make way for de la Rocque. The Maréchal has stayed on in his military post since then, but has now informed the government of his intention to also retire from military life, though he hopes to continue his career in some form. We could keep him busy by giving him a diplomatic posting, or make him a parliamentarian (a largely ceremonial role since the new constituion concentrated power in the presidency). On the other hand, some believe it would be more advantageous if Pétain fully retired."
natfra.94.a:0 "He'll do fine as a senator."
natfra.94.b:0 "Make him our ambassador in Ottawa."
natfra.94.c:0 "Pressure him to retire entirely."

natfra.95.t:0 "A New Concordat"
natfra.95.d:0 "Ever since 1789, France's relations with the Catholic Church have frequently been strained, with successive governments attacking Catholicism. This only grew worse in 1905, when the republican government broke all ties with the Church.\nToday, however, this was set right, and François de la Rocque, having arrived in Rome the day before, signed a new Concordat with the Catholic Church, restoring Roman Catholicism as the state religion of France. De la Rocque has been congratulated for this by the Pope, and the Croix-de-Feu, always the party of the Catholic right, will likely be greatly strenghtened."
natfra.95.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.96.t:0 "Anti-Semitism in the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.96.d:0 "As the Croix-de-Feu expands, we must address the question of anti-semitism among the party membership. Although de la Rocque has condemned anti-semitism in the past, and has good relations with the Chief Rabbi Jakob Kaplan, he has also been known to condemn Jewish immigration into the African territories, and has opposed the settlement in Algeria of Jewish refugees.\nMeanwhile, the Croix-de-Feu, as a nationalist mass movement, has inevitably attracted many members with anti-semitic dispositions, and as such party members are growing increasingly divided on the matter of anti-semitism.\nDe la Rocque is thus being urged by many moderates to condemn anti-semitism again, though others believe that this would hinder our efforts to absorb former Action Française supporters."
natfra.96.a:0 "We can't risk angering the radical right."
natfra.96.b:0 "We need to take a stance against these un-French sentiments."

natfra.97.t:0 "Opposition to Female Suffrage"
natfra.97.d:0 "Our recent move towards implementing female suffrage fulfills a longstanding goal of the French right, which has long supported giving women the vote, as they are seen as modest and pious, making them ideal Catholic conservative voters.\nHowever, this has also garnered much opposition, with some claiming that we are doing it only to bolster our share of the vote, even though elections are no longer worth much, and many others arguing that women simply do not have the political experience and social responsibility needed to have equal political power to men."
natfra.97.a:0 "Their complaints mean nothing."

natfra.98.t:0 "Promoting Le Flambeau"
natfra.98.d:0 "Le Flambeau has been the official newspaper of the Croix-de-Feu for several years now, loyally supporting the message of Colonel de la Rocque. However, it is of course only read by our loyal supporters, so it currently serves little use as a propaganda outlet.\nWith this in mind, two different solutions have been proposed to bolster the paper's circulation. First, we could use govent funding to drive down its price, making it too cheap for independent newspapers to compete with. On the other hand, we could subsidise shops that sell the paper and promote it in their own ways."
natfra.98.a:0 "Drive down its price with government money."
natfra.98.b:0 "Give shops subsidies for selling it."

natfra.99.t:0 "Leisure for the People"
natfra.99.d:0 "Providing for quality popular leisure activities has long been a key policy of the Croix-de-Feu, and it today became a reality, with Colonel de la Rocque signing into law the creation of a new National People's Board for Leisure, which will supervise and arrange holidays, fitness activities, youth camps, and more besides, to reward the great people of France for their loyal service."
natfra.99.b:0 "A brilliant initiative."

natfra.100.t:0 "Le Petit Journal Purchased"
natfra.100.d:0 "On the top of our efforts to further popularise Le Flambeau, the Croix-de-Feu today purchased the longstanding and prestigious conservative newspaper Le Petit Journal. The newspaper, which is over 60 years older than our party, has a wide audience and is broadly resoected, making it an ideal mouthpiece for the government's agenda and its message to the public."
natfra.100.b:0 "The people will be better informed than ever!"

natfra.101.t:0 "Le Redressement Français"
natfra.101.d:0 "As we further solidify the corporate state, we have been approached by an organisation called the Redressment Français, or French Renewal. Founded by the succesful businessman Ernest Mercier on the advice of President Foch during the 1920s, the Redressement seeks to operate as a combination of a think tank and social club for prominent businessmen, promoting a pro-business view of corporatism alongside a traditionalist social agenda. Mercier has assured de la Rocque of his loyalty, and, citing their many shared ideals, has promised to do his best to round up support for the government among his associates."
natfra.101.b:0 "A worthy ally."

natfra.102.t:0 "The CSPF Established"
natfra.102.d:0 "Today, a special act promulgated by the rump assembly confirmed by de la Rocque has brought into being the Confédération des Syndicats Professionnels Français, or French Confederation of Professional Unions. This new government entity will absorb all currently existing trade unions, bringing them under government supervison, with each profession represented by a state union within the Confederation.Under Roger Vitrac, the organisayion will surely strenghten our support among ordinary workers, and ensure the representation of the common man."
natfra.102.b:0 "A vital component of the corporate state."

natfra.103.t:0 "Marin Retires"
natfra.103.d:0 "Today, in a lengthy speech in the Assembly, Louis Marin, leader of the Fédération Républicain, announced his full retirement from public life. Marin has led a long and succesful career, leading the conservative FR for many years, and loyally supporting both the junta and now de la Rocque.\nHowever, under de la Rocque's unity government, he has seen much of his influence taken away from him, and his support largely absorbed by the Croix-de-Feu, inspiring him to retire to reduce future tensions within the government.\nNevertheless, Marin announced his full confidence in Colonel de la Rocque, and thanked the government for all its service."
natfra.103.b:0 "We shall all miss his dedication to France."

natfra.103.a:0 "We shall all miss his dedication to France."

natfra.104.t:0 "Marin Seeks to Form a Coalition"
natfra.104.d:0 "Louis Marin may be the first civilian premier in seventeen years, but the military junta remains very much in place. Now, however, it seems that the veteran republican is working to change this.\nToday, in a large speech before the Assembly, Marin announced his intention to form a unity government of parties comitted to the Republic, and his willingness to negotiate with any politician who shared his ideals of a democratic state.\nPresident Pétain is yet to comment on this development, but many of his supporters have reacted with alarm at what they see as the beginning of the end of the junta, while others believe that only this can restore political unity. Meanwhile, Marin's own allies are known to be in talks with a range of different democratic parties."
natfra.104.a:0 "Good luck, Premier!"

natfra.105.t:0 "Flandin Joins the Government"
natfra.105.d:0 "Today, it was announced to the public that Pierre-Étienne Flandin, leader of the centre-right Alliance Démocratique had joined the Marin government, after intensive talks with the FR's representatives. The news has surprised many, as the AD is a longstanding rival of the FR, and the parties have clashed before over the AD's secularism and more hardline free narket policies. Nevertheless, this has set a clear precedent for broad co-operation between republican parties, and many now hope that more will join Marin's coalition."
natfra.105.a:0 "Excellent news."

natfra.106.t:0 "Daladier Joins the Government"
natfra.106.d:0 "It was announced today that Édourad Daladier, leader of the left-wing Parti Radical, had joined the Marin government, after intensive talks with the FR's representatives. The news has surprised many, as the PR's left-of-centre policies, despite having been toned down signifcantly after the revolution, have so far made it something of a bogeyman for the right, something not helped by its frequent opposition to the junta.\nNevertheless, Daladier and Marin have compromised sufficiently for the PR to take its place in the government, meaning that combined with the AD, the coalition now has a narrow majority in the Assembly, bringing the country closer to a parliamentary system than at any other point since FOch's coup.\nBy now, any move against the government by Pétain would generate outrage and only intensify the protests which Marin is slowly defusing, and so the Maréchal has little choice but to go along with the government's moves towards republicanisation."
natfra.106.a:0 "Now, we can set to work!"

natfra.107.t:0 "Pétain's Speech"
natfra.107.d:0 "With the pressure to either fully support or move against the new coalition having steadily built up, and Marin haing energised enough support to make a move against the coalition now a deeply risky measure, President Pétain has been left with little choice but to give the government his blessing.\nIn a lengthy speech today, the Maréchal re-affirmed his full trust and confidence in Premier Marin, and in the government he had assembled. Although Marin has already energised much popular support, this endorsement has come as a major boost to his popularity, and popular trust in the coalition is soaring."
natfra.107.a:0 "He chose the right side."

natfra.108.t:0 "Restoring Public Trust"
natfra.108.d:0 "As we seek to reassert parliamentary power, we must set about restoring public faith in parliamentarism: something deeply eroded by the revolution and exile, with the Assembly seen as weak and inactive.\nMany believe that the best and simplest way to remedy this is to increase the public appearances of major politicians, and to invest more in propaganda. Others, however, argue that if we are to truely escape our reputation for sluggish inaction, we should begin pushing through legislation at a faster pace, ensuring that this gains sufficient media attention. Meanwhile, there are some who argue that our best bet is to press Pétain to give the government more open support."
natfra.108.a:0 "Marin should fill his schedule with tours and speeches."
natfra.108.b:0 "Push through some token legislation at a fast pace."
natfra.108.c:0 "Get Pétain to double down on his support."

natfra.109.t:0 "How to Appeal to Officers"
natfra.109.d:0 "If our government is to stabilise and last, we need the support, or at least acceptance, of the military. Winning this, however, will be no easy task: under the junta, the military did of course amass much political influence, something they will be loath to give up, particularly to liberal-minded civilians.\nHowever, we must still make an effort to gain their loyalty, something which some suggest we should do by greatly increasing military spending, while others argue that decreasing parliamentary oversight of the military, and giving them more autonomy on investment and strategy, would placate fears that they will lose thier influence. On the other hand, we could take a harsher stance, and threaten to investigate possible abuses under the junta if they do not comply."
natfra.109.a:0 "An increased military budget will keep them happy."
natfra.109.b:0 "Give them the final say on military affairs."
natfra.109.c:0 "Threaten to investigate them for the junta's abuses."

natfra.110.t:0 "Keeping Pétain Under Control"
natfra.110.d:0 "Philippe Pétain has dominated French politics since the death of Foch in 1929, but his obviously dictatorial and strongly presidential rule cannot continue if the Republic is to be maintained. As such, it is vital to restrain Pétain's authority, and ideally make him little more than a convenient figurehead for our own government.\nAs such, Marin has heard a proposal that his prominent loyalists in the military can be quietly posted to foreign advisory roles or the Sahara, and his aides reassigned across the civil service, thus cutting him off from allies who will try to preserve the junta.\nAlthough this proposal has gained much enthusiasm among those with whom it has been discussed, many others believe that this could be risky, and could lead to accusations of corruption or pushback from military loyalists. Thus, they argue that we should instead push through new laws that impose greater checks on executive power."
natfra.110.a:0 "Reassign Pétain's allies: we won't have him under control until he's isolated."
natfra.110.b:0 "Do it more legitimately, in spite of the opposition's complaints."

natfra.111.t:0 "Keeping Pétain Busy"
natfra.111.d:0 "As we seek to restore the Presidency to the ceremonial function that it was before 1919, we must find ways to keep Pétain occupied, keeping him from having the time to meddle in daily politics. As such, many of Marin's advisors believe that we should fill Pétain's schedule with public appearances and speeches, something which the deeply charismatic Maréchal will hardly object to, and which will also round up support for the government. On the other hand, the officers who have reluctantly thrown in their lot with us argue that it would be better for Pétain to focus on military affairs."
natfra.111.a:0 "Constant public appearances will keep him busy and gain us support."
natfra.111.b:0 "We need his military talents more than ever."

natfra.112.t:0 "The Judges of the Junta"
natfra.112.d:0 "With the government trying to resolve the corruption and intimidation that has long plagued the judicial system, we must confront the matter of the numerous judges who rose to and held their current jobs through their support for Pétain, consistently ruling in the favour of the junta and those associated with it.\nMany believe that it is time to turn over a new leaf and either remove or demote these judges, but others argue that they clearly have some administrative talent, which is in short supply and should not go to waste."
natfra.112.a:0 "Get rid of these corrupt frauds."
natfra.112.b:0 "For better or worse, we need their competence."

natfra.113.t:0 "Worries About the Release of Prisoners"
natfra.113.d:0 "With the government releasing many of the Pétain junta's political prisoners, some worries are being voiced about the possibility that various unsavoury elements will also be released, such as socialists or Algerian nationalists. These remours have been greatly seized on by de la Rocque and Maurras alike, with both Le Flambeau and the Action Française printing stories about syndicalists and native rebels being allowed back onto the streets. Many believe that we should respond to this by tightening the requirements for release, and more closely examining individual cases, but others argue that the outrcy has little basis in reality and will soon fade away, and we can thus safely ignore it."
natfra.113.a:0 "Their complaints don't matter, leave it be."
natfra.113.b:0 "Tighten the criteria for release."

natfra.114.t:0 "The Parliamentary Special Powers Act"
natfra.114.d:0 "Marin's government has consolidated itself more and more since cong to power, in spite of the military's resentment and the determined opposition of the nationalist right. However, the current state of affairs clearly is not enough for the republican parties.\nToday, Marin, cheered on by deputies from pro-republican parties of all persuasions, announced his intention to pass the "Parliamentary Special Powers Act", imposing severe checks on executive power and giving parliament the final say on almost all matters of state.\nThis has already generated uproar from the Croix-de-Feu and AF, while Pétain is yet to pass any comment.\nAlthough Marin's government has a majority in the Assembly, his own Fédération Républicain does harbour some deputies of more authoritarian persuasions, whose sympathies for a presidential state could well be galvanised through a concerted effort by the nationalists."
natfra.114.a:0 "We'll need a lot of luck to push this through..."

natfra.115.t:0 "Pushback from the Nationalists"
natfra.115.d:0 "Over the past days, both the Croix-de-Feu and Action Française have made a determined effort to prevent the Special Powers Act from passing. Their leaders have exhausted themselves with constant speeches and appearances, and their newspapers have focused all their attention on the "parliamentarian corruption" that the Act will supposedly entrench.\nMeanwhile, the parties' Dispos and Camelots have made a show of force in the streets, vigorously protesting the Marin government's policies, although the longstanding rivalry between the parties has made these protests rather tense affairs.\nWith the opposition going nowhere, the pressure is only mounting on Marin and his allies."
natfra.115.a:0 "Ask the Maréchal for his support."

natfra.116.t:0 "Meeting with the Maréchal"
natfra.116.d:0 "With the pressure to secure a majority for the Parliamentary Special Powers Act having become unsustainable, and needing to outdo the nationalists' propaganda campaign, Louis Marin today met with Philippe Pétain at the Presidential Palace in Algiers. Marin explained the critical nature of the situation to the old Maréchal, whose own political power has been steadily dismantled by the government.\nAlthough Pétain can do little concrete to ensure that the bill would pass, a tacit endorsement from him would go a long way to gaining a majority for the bill. However, the old Maréchal demanded some concessions: the Bill would be revised to include provisions for Presidential oversight over the workings of government, and to maintain the President's right to form new governments.\nWith little choice left left, Marin could only agree."
natfra.116.a:0 "His endorsement will go a long way."

natfra.117.t:0 "The Act Passes"
natfra.117.d:0 "Today, after no end of debate and controversy, the Parliamentary Special Powers Act was passed by a very narrow majority in the Assembly. This has come as major news to the nation, and makes the most decisive step in Marin's government's consolidation of parliamentary power.\nHowever, the deep divides exposed by the Act will not go away. Opposition to parliamentary rule has galvanised support for the nationalist right, with both the the Croix-de-Feu and Action Française emerging stronger than ever, having absorbed the old supporters of the junta. Meanwhile, some liberals were left dissatsfied with the concessions eventually made to Pétain.\nHowever, with the Act passed, parliamentary rule has been firmly entrenched in National France, and it cannot be denied that Marin's coalition has achieved what it had wanted to."
natfra.117.a:0 "Where next?"

natfra.118.t:0 "The Economic Policy of the Coalition"
natfra.118.d:0 "As we seek to reform French politics, we must also work to reform the economy, if we are ever to have the resources to liberate France. To this end, Marin has recieved two proposals.\nFirst, Paul Reynaud, deputy leader of the Alliance Démocratique, urges Marin to pursue a policy of economic deregulation, slashing taxes and provisions for workers' rights in order to enhance the "dynamism and productivity" of private business.\nOn the other hand, Camille Chautemps, an influential figure in the Parti Radical, wants us to pursue a program of state intervention and class co-operation, to ensure social stability and justice, and to prevent vested interests from hindering the liberation."
natfra.118.a:0 "Reynaud knows best."
natfra.118.b:0 "Chautemps's proposals are sound."

natfra.119.t:0 "Dissent Among Workers"
natfra.119.d:0 "Our recen moves towards economic deregulation have come at a dear cost: many manual labourers around the country have grown increasingly discontented with the government. Feeling that Reynaud and Marin's policies are selling them out and leaving them more vulnerable to expolitation, many have become more sympathetic to the corporartism of the Croix-de-Feu or AF, which has the potential to our government much damage in the long term."
natfra.119.a:0 "A troubling development..."

natfra.120.t:0 "Support From Business"
natfra.120.d:0 "Although many French workers have turned against the government, our policies have garnered much support among big business. Industrialists, pleased by their new freedom from excessive government oversight, are increasingly supportive of Reynaud's policies, and, by extension, the Marin government, something which will doubtless be a great boost to our influence in time to come."
natfra.120.a:0 "We are greatful for their backing."

natfra.121.t:0 "Deteriorating Business Relations"
natfra.121.d:0 "In spite of the economic growth it has caused, Chautemps's economic policies have come at a cost: many businessmen, despite their broadly liberal leanings, have become deeply dissatisfied with the government's increased regulation and pro-labour policies, which they claim limits their ability to generate profit and enrich the economy. This will likely be a blow to our government's popularity, as these businessmen may utilise their broader influence against us, and turn to the opposition."
natfra.121.a:0 "What a shame..."

natfra.122.t:0 "Winning Over the Workers"
natfra.122.d:0 "Although Chautemps's policies have caused us to lose the support of many in business, they have generated much support among the National French working class, wuth many manual labourers having shown support for Chautemps's ideals, and, by extension, the Marin government. This is especially convenient because it will come as a significant blow to de la Rocque and the Croix-de-Feu, who have long sought to build a mass movement of their own among workers."
natfra.122.a:0 "A crucial success."#

natfra.123.t:0 "A Re-Energised Legislature"
natfra.123.d:0 "Following the success of the Parliamentary Special Powers Act, and due to the ongoing efforts of Marin and his allies, initiative has greatly returned to the Assembly. With Pétain having long since accepted the loss of much of his power, having become reliant on the coalition to stay in place at all, and the Assembly having regained sweeping powers, the old system of rubberstamping the junta's demands truly has faded away, allowing for a rejuvenated and re-energised parliament at the centre of government."
natfra.123.a:0 "All is well once again."

natfra.124.t:0 "The Downsides of Loose Censorhsip"
natfra.124.d:0 "Although our move to loosen censorship has undeniably been the right thing to do, and will strenghten liberal and democratic movements, it has also provided our political enemies with more ability to openly criticise the government, playing into the hnds of both Maurras and de la Rocque, who havve ramped up their attacks on parliamentarism significantly. Furthermore even those more commited to democracy have gained new freedom to speak against specific government policies which they oppose, and to expose the wrongdoings of unscrupulous officials."
natfra.124.a:0 "A regrettable price for liberty."

natfra.125.t:0 "Confronting the Junta's Corruption"
natfra.125.d:0 "It was always an open secret across French society that the military junta, whatever its advantages, was deeply corrupt, with many an officer or loyal beureaucrat enriching himself through less than legal means.\nNow, as Marin seeks to eliminate mass corruption from the government, these unscrupulous individuals will finally lose the power which they have long abused, something especially beneficial because it will strike one last blow to the junta's support. In light of this, however, some are urging Marin to go a step further and remove many officials who cannot be proven to corrupt, but did support the junta, arguing that even if it is hardly justified, it must be done to remove the military's influence for good."
natfra.125.a:0 "Just remove the corrupt."
natfra.125.b:0 "Sack more junta loyalists too."

natfra.126.t:0 "Corruption in Our Ranks"
natfra.126.d:0 "With the Marin government firing and investigating corrupt officials en masse, concerns have been raised that many administrators on "our side", those more sympathetic to liberal reppublicanism, may also be tainted by corruption, something that could become deeply embarrassing for the government, and also greatly harm our administrative abilities. As such, it has been suggested that we turn a blind eye to the corrupt practices of the more sympathetic beureaucrats, although others staunchly oppose such double standards."
natfra.126.a:0 "Get rid of them as well."
natfra.126.b:0 "Turn a blind eye."

natfra.127.t:0 "Louis Franchet d'Ésperey Retires"
natfra.127.d:0 "Poignant news has struck the nation today, as Maréchal Louis Franchet d'Ésperey, hero of the Great War and Pétain's longstanding Chief of Staff, has gone into retirement. D'Ésperey is an old man now, and clearly feels unable to lead men in war as succesfully as he did twenty years ago, and so few can blame him for stepping back.\nNevertheless, Pétain's government has lost a vital political ally, and a popular figure capable of rounding up support for the Junta. Furthermore, without the unifying figure of d'Ésperey, debates in the military are likely to come to the surface, as Pétain will be forced to chose a new Chief of Staff."
natfra.127.a:0 "Farewell to a true patriot."

natfra.128.t:0 "A Successor to d'Ésperey"
natfra.128.d:0 "Over a week has now passed since Louis Franchet d'Ésperey retired, and Pétain has still held back on announcing a successor. This is because d'Ésperey's retirement has robbed the military of a unifying and respected figure, capable of papering over the growing doctrinal divides, as a younger generation of officers seeks to find solutions to the military's decline.\nOn one side, General Charles de Gaulle and his allies are known for their conviction that the nation can, in its current circumstances, only sustain a relatively small army, and thus should focus on professionalism, and a high quality of training and equipment. Furthermore, de Gaulle is passionate in his belief that tanks are the future of warfare, and that the Army should develop elite armoured units which can achieve concentrated, rapid breakthroughs.\nOpposing de Gaulle's faction is a group of officers centred around Admiral François Darlan and General Maxime Weygand, who follow a more traditional approach, that is often more popular among the older generation of officers. Drawing on the traditional French ideal of the citizen-soldier, and the need for strong naval and air power in order to land in the métropole, they argue for as large an army as circumstances allow, alongside a greatly strengthened Navy and Air Force, with the three forces acting in greater co-ordination.\By now, however, the pressure from both factions of the military, from civilian politicians eager to see the military reform one way or another, and from public opinion, has grown too strong for Pétain to procrastinate any longer, and he must appoint a successor."
natfra.128.a:0 "A small, elite force is what we need: bring in de Gaulle."

natfra.129.d:0 "With the liberation more and more imminent, we can no longer put off the question of the conscription of colonial subjects. The topic has long been deeply contentious, and a final decision on the matter has been avoided for years, in order to avoid criticism from colonialist hardliners and anger from the natives.\nNow, however, it is not long at all until we will dearly need manpower from the colonies, and we must confront the question of how tight our conscription requirements will be."

natfra.130.d:0 "Having taken stock of our military and industrial capacity, we can no longer hide from a simple, harsh fact. As it stands, our economy and army are nowhere near what is required to succesfully land in the métropole, and then defeat the Commune. Urgent and drastic reforms are urgently needed, and public pressure on Premier Janin is reaching a fever pitch.\nPétain himself is said to be deeply angered by the findings, demanding that Janin do something, and possibly growing more sympathetic to the voices within his government that want to see a further consolidation of the junta."

natfra.132.d:0 "Although we have set France free, it is quite clear that not everyone in the nation sees it in those terms. A large part of the population was sufficiently misguided during the war to go beyond simply defending their nation, and actively supported the socialist regime.\nNow that the socialists have been toppled many of these men have gone underground, forming resistance cells and seeking to attack and undermine the legitimate government. Defeating these terrorists will be no easy task."
natfra.132.a:0 "Terrorist Scum!"

natfra.133.t:0 "Socialist Resistance Declines"
natfra.133.d:0 "With our forces having worked tirelessly to weed out and counter the resistance movements of former Communards, we are at last seeing results, as these groups increasingly lose strength, drawing public ire for their violent actions and struggling to succesfully challenge the government.

natfra.135.t:0 "Socialist Resistance Crushed"
natfra.135.d:0 "Finally, our security forces and troops have mopped up the overwhelming part of the socialist resistance against our legitimate government.

The coming months and years will doubtless be the greatest test in all our history, and every true patriott will have to be prepared to give up everything, that France may be free once again."

natfra.137.t:0 "Dealing With the Returnees"
natfra.137.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Revolution, some two million Frenchmen fled to Algeria from the emerging Communard tyranny. Over the next decade and a half, they built new lives in North Africa, with new homes, jobs, and in the case of younger exiles new families.\nNow that France has been liberated, however, these men and women expect to return to the métropole and resume their lives as they were before the revolution, including having their property restored to them. However, these properties have been used by others for years now, and locals would be loathe to give it up to those who they see as having conquered them.\nIn light of this, many in the government propose that we allow exiles to return to their old homes and regain their old businesses, on the condition that they give up ownership of the properties they gained in North Africa to the state, which can then invest profits from these properties in reconciling and compensating those who stayed in the métropole.\nNevertheless, there are many who believe that the returnees are entitled to their property unconditionally, while others would rather we established local committees to resolve property disputes more fairly."

Before these protests get out of hand, we must settle on our response."

natfra.139.d:0 "Although our decision to allow those returning to the métropole to regain their pre-Revolution properties as long as the state assumed control of the properties they acquired in North Africa after 1919 appeared to be a reasonable compromise at the time, it has generated an unexpected amount of frustration among returnees.\nArguing that their properties in Algeria are entirely legitimate, and likening having to give this property up to socialist collectivisation.\nAs such, there are some who now argue that poorer returnees, who may well struggle to find employment in the métropole, should be allowed to hold onto their properties, while others argue that we should scrap the policy outright. Of course, there are still many who believe that once these complaints die down the policy will succeed."

natfra.140.d:0 "Although our decision to establish local committees, with representation from both returning exiles and local inhabitants, which can settle property disputes on a case-by-case basis has been broadly accepted by both groups as the fairest way to resolve the matter, these committees have increasingly faced inertia as they struggle to reach judegements satisfactory to all parties.\nMany argue that this inertia is largely due to the fact that these committees have recieved little direction from [NFA.Capital.GetName] on how to resolve disputes, or who to favour. As such, we must now provide them with more extensive guidelines on how to settle claims."

Resolving these people's plight must be an urgent priority for our government, and as such various proposals have been made for relief.\nThe most popular proposal is that we build new camps in which to house and process those who have been made homeless, before putting them in rebuilt housing when it is possible. On the other hand, some argue that we should make use of abandoned trade union and government offices as temporary accomodation, cutting costs but reducing the quality of life and ease of administration."
natfra.142.a:0 "Build new camps for them."
natfra.142.b:0 "Put them up in abandoned socialist offices.."
natfra.143.c:0 "Don't bother: they may well be traitors."

natfra.143.t:0 "Resistance Reprisals"
natfra.143.d:0 "During the war, the resistance which valiantly stayed on in the métropole to await our return came to control swathes of the country, forming the only reliable local administration as socialists were killed or fled and politicians had to stay in Algiers to be close to power.\nHowever, reports are now reaching [NFA.Capital.GetName] of heavy-handed policies adopted by these triumphant resistance fighters, with frequent tribunals of local socialists, or sometimes simply those with whom resistance members have grudges. Furthermore, the reliability of these trials has been heavily questioned, and the executions that often follow are seen by some as mere lynchings.\nThis matter is highly delicate for us due to our great debt to the resistance but also the potential embarrasment if news of this becomes more widespread, so we shall have to tread carefully."
natfra.143.a:0 "Reign this in before it causes trouble."
natfra.143.b:0 "Turn a blind eye."
natfra.143.c:0 "Their grievances are just: stand by them."

natfra.144.t:0 "What to Do With the Commune's Policemen?"
natfra.144.d:0 "As we restore order in the métropole, we will badly need a police force to assist us. However, professional policemen are in short supply as many need to remain in the colonies to maintain order there, and many others were conscripted and wounded or killed in the War.\nMeanwhile, however, there are thousands of policemen who did their jobs under the Commune, and would almost all be willing to resume their work for our government. Nevertheless, many hardliners argue that these man tainted themselves by serving the Communard regime, and that we should not allow them any influence now."
natfra.144.a:0 "Purge any policeman with socialist sympathies."
natfra.144.b:0 "Let them redeem themselves by helping us."

natfra.145.t:0 "The Soldiers of the Commune"
natfra.145.d:0 "In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Communard army, most soldiers were quickly detained by our own forces as prisoners of war, while some others fled to the forests and hills, either to continue their struggle or simply to avoid punishment. Now, however, we must decide on how to treat those soldiers that are in our custody.\nThere are some who argue that everybody who fought for the Commune is a war criminal and a traitor to France, although many argue that low-ranking common soldiers were only doing their jobs and, while their cause was wrong, they are Frenchmen too and deserve to be allowed to return home and recieve the same benefits as our soldiers, like a military pension. Indeed, there are a few who believe that we could allow privates in the Communard army to re-enlist with us."
natfra.145.a:0 "Treat them all as enemy prisoners."
natfra.145.b:0 "Don't let them serve again, but treat them as veterans."
natfra.145.c:0 "Allow those with clean records to re-enlist."

natfra.146.t:0 "Trial of the Communard Officer Corps"
natfra.146.d:0 "With several months having now passed since the socialist surrender, the greater part of their officer corps has now been tracked down and arrested, and is now awaiting trial. In such exttraordinary circumstances it is only to be expected that the state advise the judiciary on how to try these individuals, and thus many believe that they should be tried for treason en masse.\nHowever, others argue that those officers who were less overtly committed to the socialist revolution or less brutal should simply be consigned to hard labour, and in a few cases allowed to contribute their military knowledge to our own army."
natfra.146.a:0 "Allow the most spotless to advise us."
natfra.146.b:0 "Hard labour is fitting for lesser offenders."
natfra.146.c:0 "Try the lot for treason."

natfra.147.t:0 "Trial of the Union Administrators"
natfra.147.d:0 "Now that the Commune has fallen, the leadership of the traitorous trade unions that were guilty for the Revolution has almost all been rounded up and is in our hands. As such, the time for their trials is fast approaching.\nSome believe that lower-ranking officials, who were often just trying to make careers in the system around them, could be let off as long as they use their industrial knowledge and administrative skills for our benefit.\nHowever, there are many who are opposed to such a conciliatory approach and would like to see everyone given hard labour at the very least. There are also of course some hardliners who would have us arrange military tribunals, with inevitable verdicts of treason, for anyone we can."
natfra.147.a:0 "We could do with theur know-how."
natfra.147.b:0 "Put them all on trial."
natfra.147.c:0 "Military tribunals await these scum."

natfra.148.t:0 "Trial of the Socialist Politicians"
natfra.148.d:0 "Pivert, Déat, Valois, Bucard, Thorez, Blum, Fauré, Battaile. All these vile names and so many others have stained our national consciousness for all too long, as their tyranny attempted to destroy all that is beautiful about the French nation.\nNow, however, the leadership of the Commune its the countless lackeys are almost all in our custody, and we have at last amassed the political capital to try them for their crimes. While it is inevitable that the most high-ranking will be executed for treason, their ministers and cronies are a matter of contention.\nSome are of the belief that a life of hard labour would preserve them as living memorials of treason while making them pay for years, while others argue that heavily publicised but fair trials would be the best way to expose the horrors they committed. Of course, there are many who want them publically executed as soon as possible."
natfra.148.a:0 "Hard labour for life."
natfra.148.b:0 "Give them fair trials, though the verdict is inevitable."
natfra.148.c:0 "Public hangings are the least they deserve."

natfra.149.t:0 "The Division of France"
natfra.149.d:0 "The national building in Algiers today has been seeing lots of activity as many generals and ministers have been gathering together today for a meeting that will have very important outcomes. Where just the other day the French Tricolour and Eagle were flying proudly in the wind and on every street corner as celebrations for victory in the reclamation of their homeland was achieved, today it seems to be a much more somber mood among the hungover representatives. The reason being that the liberation has brought Nationalist French troops into contact with the Germans, and while both were sure to celebrate and drink together at this meeting, the politicians behind closed doors had a new migraine to deal with. The migraine of what to do with Germans being in their newly regained homeland.\n'We must push them out, to let them stay in our rightful lands is an insult to the journey here!' A general shouted, and gained applause from fellow military members. Another minister began his counterpoint right after, stating that to throw the diplomatic option out the window after all this would be the true insult to the newly liberated. Right when the arguments were getting heated between the two, a single notoriously pessimistic minister stated aloud that any sort of confrontation could mean disaster, as the French were not in a position on the front or African interior for a new set of hostilities. Ultimately after another hour of discussion on the situation and the representative’s confidence in this, the decision was made."
natfra.149.a:0 "Begin to mobilise, and prepare an ultimatum for our land."
natfra.149.b:0 "We can settle this peacefully, prepare to negotiate."
natfra.149.c:0 "We can't risk a conflict or crisis in this situation."

natfra.150.t:0 "The French Ultimatum"
natfra.150.d:0 "The German man sat on the balcony, drinking his coffee to help go with his breakfast bread roll, enjoying the view outside the Foreign Ministry’s office when he heard his adjutant knocking on the door to his room, saying he had urgent news. Answering the door to his adjutant he was handed a telegram that came from the German diplomat in Algiers, stating that he was handed an ultimatum by the French Foreign Minister over the lands the German army held in France. Realizing the urgency of this news, the German official quickly gathered together fellow important members of the Foreign Office and awaited the Kaiser. Sitting in a conference room the members quietly bickered among themselves over what they could do. Two members argued that they should flat out reject the ultimatum, while some stated that they could use this to their leverage and perhaps negotiate the french into a different offer. However, as the door opened and the Kaiser walked in, the talk died down and all members inside stood up stiffly to present the news to the Kaiser, and awaited his answer to the problem."
natfra.150.a:0 "We will never betray the sacrifices of those who died for this land!"
natfra.150.b:0 "Very well, but demand economic concessions in return."
natfra.150.c:0 "We can't risk a war with the French: fall back."

natfra.151.t:0 "The Germans Refuse"
natfra.151.d:0 "We have received a response from the German foreign ministry about our ultimatum, and it was the worst we could have feared. They have flat out refused to leave the lands they have occupied, and now it seems our nation is holding bated breath to see how our government responds to this denial of Full liberation."
natfra.151.a:0 "To war!"
natfra.151.b:0 "They've called our bluff: back down."

natfra.152.t:0 "The French Declare War"
natfra.152.d:0 "It seems our refusal has only angered them, for a few hours after our answer reached the French government, planes and infantry crossed the lines where our two nations' armies had stopped. It seems where just the other day our troops were drinking together in celebration of victory against the syndicalists was temporary as now their planes strafe our troops and hostile contact all across the frontline is being reported. If they wish for a fight, they shall receive one."
natfra.152.a:0 "Furs Vaterland!"

natfra.153.t:0 "The French Back Down"
natfra.153.d:0 "It seems that the French have backed down from their aggressive stance after we refused their ultimatum, with their troops not mobilizing and their government stating now was time to consolidate their liberated lands. Our ministers and Kaiser all take this as a diplomatic victory as they have ensured the fatherland has come out on top after all this."
natfra.153.a:0 "Another triumph for Weltpolitik!"

natfra.154.t:0 "The Germans Demand Concessions"
natfra.154.d:0 "The Germans have responded to our ultimatum for our lands back by sending their ambassador back to us with an offer. Sitting down and discussing, the German ambassador showed us that they would accept a deal, they would give us the land back in exchange we pay economic concessions for the effort the Germans put in during the second weltkrieg, alongside a demilitarized border to protect the German people. Now we must decide, is this the price to pay for getting the rest of our homeland back or is this an embarrassment we will not tolerate at the hands of the Germans?"
natfra.154.a:0 "A small price to pay."
natfra.154.b:0 "This is inadequate for the French people."

natfra.155.t:0 "The French Accept"
natfra.155.d:0 "The French have accepted our terms for giving back their lands, in exchange they shall pay us back through concessions. Our foreign ministers and diplomatic corps are celebrating this victory, for we have once again managed to keep peace while ensuring the Fatherland still comes out on top."
natfra.155.a:0 "Peace is maintained!"

natfra.156.t:0 "Our Next Move"
natfra.156.d:0 "It has become apparent to our government that after the rejection of the German offer to form a deal, the diplomatic option has been removed off the table. The German’s arrogance towards us and our attempts to reunify France have made it so now it seems continuing the war footing is the only way to truly achieve our dream. However the question stands about whether we are actually capable of continuing the war against another large opponent."
natfra.156.a:0 "To war!"
natfra.156.b:0 "We stand no chance in such a conflict."

natfra.157.t:0 "The French Back Down"
natfra.157.d:0 "It appears that after the French have rejected our offer, they also do not wish for a conflict so the status quo stands. This is a propaganda victory for our regime as it appears the French’s stubbornness is greater than their ability to come to a compromise for the good of their people."
natfra.157.a:0 "Their loss."

natfra.158.t:0 "The Germans Give In"
natfra.158.d:0 "Our government celebrates our diplomatic victory as the Germans gave into our ultimatum, leaving the lands we wished to gain in the liberation. Their troops are leaving our lands without a fight and we have flown the tricolor triumphantly over the Eiffel Tower in our rightful capital. Now we can fully begin rebuilding and cementing our rule over our newly regained lands."
natfra.158.a:0 "A crucial diplomatic triumph!"

natfra.159.t:0 "The French Want to Negotiate"
natfra.159.d:0 "Today the Nationalist French representatives in Berlin contacted our ministers with the help of a Canadian middle man. Wishing to strike a deal with the Kaiser’s government for the French lands, they invited the Kaiser’s diplomats to Bordeaux where both nations could discuss a change of hands for the French lands the German army took in the second weltkrieg."
natfra.159.a:0 "Let's see what their terms are."
natfra.159.b:0 "Don't bother."

natfra.160.t:0 "The German Delegation Arrives"
natfra.160.d:0 "The French foreign minister watched in silence as the German delegation walked into the boardroom. The snapping of the camera’s from all the reporters watching the Germans walk into the room was an annoyance to the minister, who previously had to satiate his nervousness with multiple smoke breaks in preparation of this moment. Now he had to put on a fake smile and nod to the diplomats on the opposite side of the table, who similarly had to fake positivity to this tense moment. Now the delegations open their notes and begin to discuss the opening of what will decide the future of both French and Germany’s relations as well as the many French people living on the side that the German army occupied."
natfra.160.a:0 "Let's see what they can offer us."

natfra.161.t:0 "Our Demands for the French"
natfra.161.d:0 "Arriving in Bordeaux our diplomats immediately got to working out some possible offers to give the French in exchange for their land back. We now have to choose which one is acceptable to the Kaiser for the exchange of land. First, Option A which asks for a demilitarised border and a promise of Non-Aggression. Option B  also asks for economic concessions from the French. Option C is requiring german garrisons remaining in the territory we give back to the French to ensure peace and the promised deal is actually gone through with on the French part."
natfra.161.a:0 "A promise of non-aggression, and a demilitarised border."
natfra.161.b:0 "Demand economic concessions too."
natfra.161.c:0 "Only if our troops stay in France can we enforce peace."

natfra.162.t:0 "The German Demands"
natfra.162.d:0 "The Germans have finally stopped the diplomatic sidestepping in the conference and given us their official demands. They ask for a DMZ alongside the border of Nancy to ensure Security of the Germans within those lands they took after the very First Weltkrieg. They also asked for a promise in the treaty we will sign of Non-Agression, where our leaders will have a connected red telephone with the specific intent of being able to call one another to ensure the promised peace will still stand."
natfra.162.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.162.b:0 "We can make no promises."

natfra.163.t:0 "The German Demands"
natfra.163.d:0 "The Germans have finally stopped the diplomatic sidestepping in the conference and given us their official demands. They ask for a non-aggression treaty alongside a demilitarized zone along the post-First Weltkrieg borders, giving us the land back. They also asked for economic concessions to repay their effort in the war, meaning we will likely have to devout a good bit of industry and our resources to repay the Germans for this land exchange."
natfra.163.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.163.b:0 "We shall never sell our country to the boches!"

natfra.164.t:0 "The German Demands"
natfra.164.d:0 "The Germans have finally stopped the diplomatic sidestepping in the conference and given us their official demands. They ask for a promise of peace between our nations where we will keep a demilitarized zone on the border of Nancy, as well as economic concessions to pay for the regained land. While we were just settling on understanding what the previous demands would mean, they gave us an even more radical demand. They also require the presence of German garrisons in the land they occupied after the war, to ensure the peace-deal and transfer goes along smoothly. Now we will have to decide if this is worth paying."
natfra.164.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.164.b:0 "A continued military presence would be an insult to the nation!"

natfra.165.t:0 "The Failure of the Bordeaux Conference"
natfra.165.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned to Berlin from Bordeaux, with the word of the French refusal of our offers arriving in the city beforehand. Although it is a shame to the diplomatic corps, the Kaiser had already prepared for the French and their notorious stubbornness getting in the way of an agreement. Organizing collaboration with the French mayors in our occupied area, as well as talking with French monarchist elements who were discontent with the syndicalist rule, we now have the foundation for setting up a state loyal to Berlin."
natfra.165.a:0 "Their loss."

natfra.166.t:0 "All Quiet on the Western Border"
natfra.166.d:0 "The German soldiers were having dinner on a hill in the French countryside, looking out at the town in the distance where the Nationalist French tricolor flies and where just a week before they had celebrated in front of cameras at the linking up of the two nation’s armies. Now the grenadier’s noticed the French soldiers they were drinking with before now didn’t come over to their side anymore, while also not letting citizens beyond the village of the French held territory. Meanwhile in Berlin, the German foreign minister was finishing up his dinner at the table after looking at a map of the territory both nations held and where it stopped once it reached the other. Although the French regime in Algiers had always communicated via using the Canadians as middle-men beforehand, now they haven’t talked in a while after they finished the fighting, not even offering further negotiations or talks on the border situation."
natfra.166.a:0 "Let's hope they stay that way."

natfra.167.t:0 "The Germans Refuse to Negotiate"
natfra.167.d:0 "The Germans have denied giving us our land back at the Bordeaux conference, stating that if we weren’t willing to accept a deal, then they would have no reason to give us the land back. Those words were feared and dreaded, however now it’s clear this is our reality, so now our government has to take a deep breath and think clearly. We could finally take up the generals' offers and retake our rightful lands via force, however war is dreaded. But it seems the other option is to just admit that our current reclaimed land is what we will have to deal with, as we don’t wish to compromise or go to war with the Germans. Now our leader has to make this titanic decision, a decision that will decide the fate of the future state of France."
natfra.167.a:0 "We have no choice: to war!"
natfra.167.b:0 "We can't afford such a conflict."

natfra.168.t:0 "Les Macquisards"
natfra.168.d:0 "Over the past few months, the resistance to German rule within our lands has greatly increased, coalescing into a loose movement known as the Macquisards, believed to be centred around the young aristocratic officer Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie, who has gone underground with his loyalists to co-ordinate operations against us.\nEven more worryingly, it appears that the National French regime in [NFA.Capital.GetName] has been funding de la Vigerie, and supplying his men with advisors and guns. As such, many believe that we should request further reinforcements from our backers in Berlin, though there are some who believe we can manage the situation by ourselves."
natfra.168.a:0 "Handle the matter ourselves."
natfra.168.b:0 "We can't afford such a conflict."

natfra.169.t:0 "[FRP.GetNameDef] Wants Reinforcements"
natfra.169.d:0 "It appears that the situation in [FRP.GetNameDef] is growing more and more unstable, with the French government coming under increasing attack from a loose resistance movement known as the Macquisards, dominated by conservative Catholics who sympathise with the National French in [NFA.Capital.GetName].\nAs such, the [FRP.GetNameAdj] government is nnow requesting that we send 35,000 more soldiers into their territory, under Walter Model, to pacify the countryside and secure their government."
natfra.169.a:0 "Very well: send Model."
natfra.169.b:0 "This isn't worth it."

natfra.170.t:0 "Model's Demands"
natfra.170.d:0 "Having been sent by Germany at the head of 35,000 reinforcements tasked with pacifying the country and fighting back the Macquisards, Walther Model has now made an extraordinary demand from the government: that he be allowed to form a new national military administration, accountable only to Berlin, with sweeping powers to eliminate all dissent.\nMost in the government believe that we have no choice but to give in, particularly since Model is known for his un-cooperative personality and the effectiveness of his forces could greatly decrease if he feels unmotivated to prop us up. Furthermore, Model makes no secret of his brutal intentions in defeating the Macquisards, and stepping aside for him may clear our own reputations."
natfra.170.a:0 "So be it: give Model control."
natfra.170.b:0 "This is too far."

natfra.171.t:0 "The Countryside Pacified"
natfra.171.d:0 "Finally, after extensive actions by our lately empowered forces, it appears that the Macquisard resistance has been broken. With the French countryside having been turned upside down by small detachments of troops equipped with flamethrowers and machine guns, the loose resistance to our government never stood a chance, and yesterday Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie was arrested and, following a military tribunal, hung."
natfra.171.a:0 "Brilliant news!"

natfra.172.t:0 "Forces in the Countryside Collapse"
natfra.172.d:0 "Shocking news reached [FRP.Capital.GetName] today: our forces in the countryside which have desperately attempted to crush the Macquisards have been roundly beaten, and are now in total collapse, with most trying to evacuate across the German border. This leaves [FRP.Capital.GetName] entirely cut off from support, and our government's days are, it seems, numbered."
natfra.172.a:0 "A catastrophe!"

natfra.173.t:0 "The Macquisards Storm [FRP.Capital.GetName]"
natfra.173.d:0 "The inevitable has now happened, and after two days of intense and bloody street fighting, the Macquisards have siezed full control of [FRP.Capital.GetName], with Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie, at the head of a newly formed Emergency Government, declaring himself Provisional Chief of State, until the crisis can be resolved.\nDe la Vigerie makes no secret of his support for the National French in [NFA.Capital.GetName], and as such his government's best hope is that they will respond to his pleas for support and send in their forces to secure the country, although the Germans, having just lost a prized satellite, may well have other ideas."
natfra.173.a:0 "What now?"

natfra.174.t:0 "Macquisards Topple the [FRP.Capital.GetName] Government"
natfra.174.d:0 "It seems that our decision to fund the Macquisard resistance against the German occupation has very much paid off: reports have just reached [NFA.Capital.GetName] that after two days of intense fighting in [FRP.Capital.GetName], the Macquisards under Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie have siezed control of the government, while the German forces chaotically fall back.\nDe la Vigerie has always been a staunch supporter of our legitimacy, and he carried out his coup with the intention of re-unifying France under our government. As such, there are many who believe that we should sieze this valuable opportunity to send our forces into [FRP.GetNameDef] in order to save the Macquisards and realise the dream of re-unification. However, others fear that the government in Berlin will not take kindly to such a move."
natfra.174.a:0 "Move in before the Germans do!"
natfra.174.b:0 "Wait to see how Germany reacts."

natfra.175.t:0 "The National French Sieze our Lands!"
natfra.175.d:0 "Shocking news has reached Berlin: it seems that, following a violent coup by internal resistance groups, our French satellite has entirely collapsed, with an anti-German emergency government under Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie inviting the National French to take control of the country.\nNational France wasted little time in agreeing, and its forces have swiftly moved in and siezed strategic positions across our former prized territory, with our troops now in a chaotic retreat towards Elsass-Lothringen. Many want us to counter-attack and crush the scum in [NFA.Capital.GetName], though many fear that we're in no state for yet another war in France."
natfra.175.a:0 "We've lost the initiative: fall back."
natfra.175.b:0 "We shall never betray the sacrifices made for that land!"

natfra.176.t:0 "Macquisards Topple the [FRP.Capital.GetName] Government"
natfra.176.d:0 "Shocking news has reached Berlin: it seems that the German-backed government in [FRP.Capital.GetName] has been toppled by a loose resistance movement dubbed the Macquisards, with the nationalist aristocrat Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie forming a new independent government.\nDe la Vigerie, it seems, was funded by the National French in his coup, and now intends to hand over the country to their regime. Allowing this to go ahead would be a major humiliation, but some wonder how well-prepared we are for yet another war in France, particularly as our available forces have been thrown into chaos by the uprising."
natfra.176.a:0 "Fall back and let them have it."
natfra.176.b:0 "Send our troops in before National France does!"

natfra.177.t:0 "The Germans Fall Back"
natfra.177.d:0 "It seems that, with their Western forces thrown into chaos by the Macquisards' coup, the Germans have been unwilling to risk a protracted war, and have reluctantly retreated from France, in practice leaving the country to us. This is a massive victory for our government, both at home and abroad, and we can now set about working with de la Vigerie and his heroic patriots to build a great and united France."
natfra.177.a:0 "Brilliant news!"

natfra.178.t:0 "The Germans Attack"
natfra.178.d:0 "Our decision to wait and see how Germany responds to the Macquisard coup seems to have backfired, and the Germans have opted to hastily send in their forces to re-occupy their old possessions.\nBy themselves, de la Vigerie's forces stand no chance of holding off the German army, and if we do not intervene they would inevitably be crushed. However, coming to their rescue would mean war with Germany, and defeating the Boches would be no mean feat."
natfra.178.a:0 "We must save our fellow Frenchmen!"
natfra.178.b:0 "De la Vigerie is on his own."

natfra.179.t:0 "Crushing the Macquisards"
natfra.179.d:0 "Now that we have decided to fight off the Macquisard resistance ourselves, we must decide on our policy on how to stamp out de la Vigerie's traitors. There are many in the government who believe that our first priority should be to win the hearts and minds of the French people, by focusing on propaganda and avoiding excessive brutality. However, many in the military dismiss this as wishful thinking and believe that special powers to crush dissent must urgently be granted to the army."
natfra.179.a:0 "Focus on propaganda."
natfra.179.b:0 "Crush them, whatever the cost."

natfra.180.t:0 "Macquisards Crushed"
natfra.180.d:0 "It seems that our gamble of supporting the Macquisard resistance against German occupation has come to nothing. A brutal campaign of pacification by the Germans and their lackeys has stamped out most organised resistance, and recent reports indicate that de la Vigerie himself was recently hung after being captured.\nThe remnants of the Macquisards are now fleeing across the border into our territory, where they are welcomed as heroes, but the dream of French re-unification seems further off than ever, with every possibility exhausted and German relations at an all-time low."
natfra.180.a:0 "We shall never forget their heroism."

natfra.181.t:0 "National France Seeks to Improve Relations"
natfra.181.d:0 "Over recent weeks, the National French government has notably softened its rhetoric towards us, now that it has largely rebuilt its country and needs to rebuild its place on the world stage. They have now gone a step further, proposing that we establish permanent embassies in each other's capitals for the first time since 1914. We cannot afford another war in France, and the financial incentives of a new thaw in relations leave us with little reason to reject this opportunity."
natfra.181.a:0 "Very well: set up an embassy in [NFA.Capital.GetName]."

natfra.182.t:0 "Germany Agrees"
natfra.182.d:0 "Germany has given its blessing to our proposal for a permanent exchange of ambassadors, and the accomplished German diplomat Herbert von Dirksen has arrived in Paris as the German ambassador, while a large new embassy is being built.\nThis is a major step for greater collaboration between our two countries, and the French government makes no secret of its intention to further build on this accomplishment to secure a new trade deal with the Reich."
natfra.182.a:0 "A crucial diplomatic success!"

natfra.183.t:0 "The Franco-German Trade Deal is Ratified"
natfra.183.d:0 "Today, the two governments of France and Germany formally ratified an extensive trade deal, allowing for the free exchange of resources and goods across the border, and giving each country's businesses favourable terms by which to operate in the other.\nThis is an unprecedented step towards peace between France and Germany, and diplomats from both countries are increasingly optimistic about future relations, though it remains to be seen just how far the German government will go in the name of reconciliation."
natfra.183.a:0 "Brilliant news!"

natfra.184.t:0 "The Franco-German Trade Deal is Ratified"
natfra.184.d:0 "Today, the two governments of France and Germany formally ratified an extensive trade deal, allowing for the free exchange of resources and goods across the border, and giving each country's businesses favourable terms by which to operate in the other.\nThis is an unprecedented step towards peace between France and Germany, and diplomats from both countries are increasingly optimistic about future relations, though it remains to be seen just how far we are prepared to go in the name of reconciliation."
natfra.184.a:0 "Time will tell..."

natfra.185.t:0 "The French Request a Non-Interference Treaty"
natfra.185.d:0 "Today, the French government made an unprecedented request, inspired by recent thaws in their relations with us. They propose that we sign an indefinite treaty of non-interference, similar to those signed by various countries before the First Weltrkieg, in which we would promise not to attack each other, and to avoid meddling in each other's diplomatic affairs, including through the establishment of spheres of influence.\nAlthough many diplomats, particularly from the younger generation, are enthusiastic about the idea, as are many world powers observing events and German businessmen eager to expand into France, there are many in the military and Reichstag who are deeply wary of any reconciliation with the French, and who have not forgotten the horrific war that they plunged us into in 1939."
natfra.185.a:0 "Peace is in everyone's interests."
natfra.185.b:0 "This is a step too far."

natfra.186.t:0 "The Germans Accept"
natfra.186.d:0 "Today, we were notified by Ambassador Dirksen that the German government has accepted our proposal of a non-interference treaty, and intends to formally sign it soon. Although some details need to be ironed out, such as the exact borders of our mutual spheres of influence, and the legal status of former French colonies, this is a massive diplomatic success, and one which has earned us no end of praise around the world, with [NFA.GetLeader] declaring the agreement to signify "peace in our time"."
natfra.186.a:0 "Never again shall Europe be plunged into senseless war."

natfra.187.t:0 "The Germans Refuse"
natfra.187.d:0 "Today, we were notified by Ambassador Dirksen that the German government has refused our proposal of a non-interference treaty, and although they have every intention of good relations, cannot commit to such a major step so hastily.\nDespite the recent improvements in relations between our two countries, this has surprised few, as most saw it as inevitable that the perennial rivalry between France and Germany would come back to bite. Although we are still commited to softer relations with the Reich, from now on we won't get ahead of ourselves."
natfra.187.a:0 "Regrettable."

natfra.188.t:0 "Aggressive Rhetoric in France"
natfra.188.d:0 "It has come to the attention of the German government that aggressive rhetoric from the French government, regarding their former colonies and Alsace-Lorraine, is rapidly increasing, alongside increased conscription and re-armament.\nIt seems that our neighbours to the West are readying for another war, or at least another war scare, and are prepared to plunge Europe into a hellish conflict in the name of their petty irredentism yet again. If that is the case, then the Reich stands."
natfra.188.a:0 "A despicable affront to peace."

natfra.189.t:0 "The French Ultimatum"
natfra.189.d:0 "Today, what we have expected for months came to pass. We have been delivered a formal ultimatum by the French, declaring all our conquests of French territory from 1870 on to be illegitimate, and demanding the full return of Alsace-Lorraine and all the French colonies that we siezed at the end of the Weltkrieg.\nAccepting this would be a national humiliation, and a symbol of surrender to French aggression, but the war that would ensue if we refuse could be truly catastrophic for the entire world."
natfra.189.a:0 "There is no way that we could accept this."
natfra.189.b:0 "Can we seriously cope with yet another war?"

natfra.190.t:0 "The Germans Refuse"
natfra.190.d:0 "Predictably enough, Germany has refused to flat-out to comply with our ultimatum, declaring it an affront to peace and decrying us as aggressors who would plunge the world into war yet again.\nThe more jingoistic members of our government demand that we now declare war on the Reich, as we threatened to do, in order to finally bring the Boches to justice for their crimes against France, but many doubt how well we would fare in such a conflict."
natfra.190.a:0 "Begin to mobilise for war."
natfra.190.b:0 "We can challenge German hegemony more peacefully."

natfra.191.t:0 "The Germans Give In"
natfra.191.d:0 "Clearly too exhausted and dispirited by the Second Weltkrieg to allow yet another war to break out, Germany has astonishingly given in to our ultimatum, and announced the full return of French colonies and Alsace-Lorraine to the French government, with their forces rapidly back from the relevant areas.\nThis is the greatest triumph our government has ever known: finaally, after the spilling of so much blood, the German tyrant has been brought to its knees, and after decades under the Reich's boot, Alsace-Lorraine is free once again. Frenchmen across the country have already broken into wild celebrations at their nation'a newfound ascendency on the world stage."
natfra.191.a:0 "Hurrah!"

natfra.192.t:0 "France Presses for Dunkirk"
natfra.192.d:0 "Now that the National French have rebuilt their country after the Second Weltkrieg, they have begun seeking to restore their position on the world stage. Hence, we today recieved a demand from the French government that we return the city of Dunkirk to them, though it is unclear how they will respond if we refuse."
natfra.192.a:0 "So be it."
natfra.192.b:0 "Never!"

natfra.193.t:0 "[From.GetName] Returns Dunkirk"
natfra.193.d:0 "Clearly the [From.GetNameAdj] government has accepted our terms, with their diplomats indicating to us that they are happy to restore the port to us, and that their own forces and administration will leave the city soon. This is a key diplomatic success for our government, and will doubtless give us more prestige at home."
natfra.193.a:0 "Great news!"

natfra.194.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Return Dunkirk"
natfra.194.d:0 "Clearly the [From.GetNameAdj] government has not been sufficiently intimidated by our terms, with their diplomats indicating to us that they are will in no way restore the port to us, and that our claims have no legitimacy. We must now decide on how to resolve this issue, with many now demanding a war to put these upstarts in their place."
natfra.194.a:0 "There is little we can do."
natfra.194.b:0 "Crush them!"

natfra.195.t:0 "The Carribean Question"
natfra.195.d:0 "After the chaos of the French and British revolutions, our colonies in the Carribean were merged into one West Indies Federation, which came to be politically dominated by the Anglo population, rather than the French. So far we have had to accept its existence nontheless, due to our own inability to administer the land, but with France rebuilt there are those who want us to rethink our policy."
natfra.195.a:0 "Request the return of the French Carribean."
natfra.195.b:0 "The status quo is just fine."

natfra.196.t:0 "France Presses for its Carribean Holdings"
natfra.196.d:0 "Having rebuilt France and restored order around the country, our National French allies are now seeking the restoration of their former colonial holdings in the West Indies. Many believe that, as the Federation itself was only ever a provisional measure and the French population has often been discontented, we would do well to accept the French demands, though there are those who are more reluctant."
natfra.196.a:0 "Very well."
natfra.196.b:0 "That land is integral to the country."

natfra.197.t:0 "[From.GetName] Returns Our Carribean Holdings"
natfra.197.d:0 "Clearly, our demands have had the right effect on the [From.GetNameAdj] government, which has been sufficiently intimidated or otherwise pressured in order to confirm that the former French colonies in the Carribean will be promptly restored to the direct rule of our government. This is a major victory for us, and we are thankful for our allies' co-operation."
natfra.197.a:0 "Excellent!"

natfra.198.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Return Our Carribean Holdings"
natfra.198.d:0 "Clearly, our demands have failed to have the right effect on the [From.GetNameAdj] government, which has had the audacity to refuse outright to restore any former French colonies to our direct control. Although this is a humiliating affront to our government, [From.GetNameDef] has the support of the British, and we cannot risk the Entente alliance by pressing the matter further."
natfra.198.a:0 "What a shame."

natfra.199.t:0 "Marin's Demands"
natfra.199.d:0 "For some years now, Louis Marin has used the influential position allowed to him by the Junta to work hard to legitimise Pétain's regime among French liberals, doing a great deal to round up support for military rule - if only as a provisional measure. In exchange, Pétain previously promised Marin that he would make good on this support, and restore the Constitution after France was liberated.\nAnd now that Pétain has indeed succeeded in liberating the nation, Marin and his allies in the Fédération Républicaine, alongside Croix-de-Feu politicians hoping for electoral success, and more left-leaning liberals, are all pressuring Pétain to follow through on his word, while his backers in the military look on with trepidation."
natfra.199.a:0 "Make favourable gestures to the liberals."

In exchange, Pétain previously promised Marin that he would make good on this support, and further shift towards a Catholic Presidential state after the Liberation.\nHowever, now that Pétain has succeeded, a tragic spanner has been thrown into the works. Last night, François de la Rocque was shot dead while giving a speech, in an attack by socialist partisans. This untimely death has left the junta vulnerable, without its main civilian backer to legitimise its rule during the Reconstruction of France. Some now believe that Pétain should look to the younger generation of officers, including his own Premier, to revitalise the government, while others, including the remianing Croix-de-Feu leaders, would rather Pétain moved to centralise power around himself."
natfra.200.a:0 "The younger generation will round up support."
natfra.200.b:0 "Pétain can do this himself."

natfra.201.t:0 "Signs of Inertia"
natfra.201.d:0 "When Pétain consolidated the Junta's power in the wake of the Janin Affair, he was supported, albeit reluctantly, by many civilian politicians, such as the liberal conservative Louis Marin and the Catholic Corporatist François de la Rocque. However, Pétain consistently refused to make major concessions to either of these men, and over the years both started to drift from the junta.\nBefore the Liberation, this was hardly an issue, as the need for national unity in such a time of crisis was able to prevent their discontent from rising too high or causing trouble among the population. Now that France is back in our hands, however,  there is rising frustration with the Military Government, which is once again coming to be seen as stagnant and inert at a time when millions are hoping for a capable and determined government to handle the task of Reconstruction.\nSome of Pétain's advisors thus believe he should capitalise further on his own prestige, which luckily has not been greatly reduced by people's frustration with the junta, by going on a new tour of the nation. Others, meanwhile, believe that it is time he delegates more to the younger officers within his clique, as a way of showing that the junta still has life in it."

General de Gaulle, having grown up in a deeply Catholic middle class family and been influenced by the early writings of Maurras, is known for his monarchist sympathies, though it is yet to be seen whether he will follow through on a restoration of the Orléans Monarchy."

Admiral Darlan is unique among the military men who dominate politics due to his naval background, something which he takes great pride in, arguing that the Navy was the only section of the Armed Forces which was not defeated in the Great War, and it is widely believed that he intends for his allies within the naval officer corps to dominate the new government."

His opponents have been roundly discredited, locked up, or otherwise dealt with, and the overly ambitious members of his clique have been reminded of their place. Meanwhile, public admiration for the Maréchal has reached a new heigh.\nThe pressure on Pétain to make way for fresh leadership or liberalise has thus greatly lessened, and instead he has maintained the authoritarian and traditionalist rhetoric of the Révolution Nationale, promising the French people that corrupt and divisive Republican politics will never again hinder their interests."

However, those who know de Gaulle better argue that to him, a strong President and a strong King serve the same purpose: an effective, centralising leader, around whom the nation can rally."

natfra.214.t:0 "Policy Towards the Maurrasians"
natfra.214.d:0 "Our restoration of the monarchy has brought up the imminent need for us to decide on our policy regarding those who have led the calls for a restoration for decades: the Action Français. As a young man, de Gaulle, like many, admired Maurras, before drifting away from the AF as he developed his own centralist ideals, and rose through the Junta. Meanwhile, the strong emphasis placed by the AF on localism and decentralisation - indeed, Maurras first became a monarchist out of his regionalism - contrasts sharply to the direction of de Gaulle's policies.\nThis leaves us with a difficult decision before us: our new Kingdom will lack legitimacy if it hardly has the support of French monarchists, but gaining their support would compromise the ideals which inspired de Gaulle to establish the Kingdom in the first place. As such, some believe that we should allow Maurras and his allies to gain advisory positions in the government so long as they agree to accept centralism, although they would inevitably continue to privately advocate for some level of localism. Meanwhile, others would rather we sidelined the Maurrasians entirely, and worked to promote our own brand of centralist monarchism."

natfra.215.d:0 "President de Gaulle's decision to forgo his own monarchist instincts, and instead secure a centralised Presidential dictatorship, has been welcomed with much enthusiasm by the Catholic Corporatists of the Croix-de-Feu, one of the few remaining legal political parties due to their consistent support for the Junta and their own authoritarian populism. Many thus believe that de Gaulle would do well to give Croix-de-Feu politicians a greater role in the government.\nHowever, the Party has long sought to form a populist mass movement of its own, with institutions such as paramilitaries, soup kitchens, and the innovation in French politics of official mass membership, to the point where it almost forms a state of its own for its members. Some within de Gaulle's government thus believe that the Croix-de-Feu is far too ambitious to be trusted with much power, and we should take steps to limiting their influence before they get too big for their boots."

natfra.222.d:0 "In the years between Pétain's consolidation of power and the Liberation, we came to promote a traditionalist and strongly authoritarian ideology, the Révolution Nationale, designed to sweep away Republicanism and Parliamentarism and restore a strong, traditional, ideal of France.\nNow that Pétain has compromised more thoroughly with the Republican establishment and restored the Constitution, however, we can no longer plausibly continue this rhetoric, and so we must find a way to end the policy with some dignity."

natfra.223.d:0 "The Constitution of the Third Republic leaves us with little choice but to hold wall-to-wall fixed term elections, for the Assembly, Local Government, and more besides. Of course, we have every imperative to intervene in these elections to make sure that trustworthy, loyal men from pro-Pétain parties such as the Fédération Républicaine and Croix-de-Feu emerge victorious, but within Pétain's government there are different proposals for how to do so."

His current Premier, Charles de Gaulle, is a loyal military man, having been appointed shortly after the Junta's consolidation of power.\nHowever, the growing calls to review de Gaulle's position have been backed by both the Croix-de-Feu and Fédération Républicaine, who publicly argue that civilian representation is needed for Republican life to truly resume, but in truth hope to extend their influence by seeing one of their men gain the position. Adding more weight to the suggestions for a new Premier are the lingering worries about de Gaulle's own ambitions, which showed themselves all too clearly in the crisis after the Liberation."

natfra.225.t:0 "The Constitution Revised"
natfra.225.d:0 "Up to now, the restored Constitution of the Third Republic imposed term limits on the Presidency, which if left be would have eventually forced Philippe Pétain to retire, a deeply damaging blow for national unity and stability.\nToday, however, Pétain announced that the Constitution, by a near-unanimous vote, had been revised to specifically establish the Presidency as a lifetime institution, with impeachment, resignation, or death the only means by which Pétain can now be removed from office. With Pétain's health in good shape and the political class loyal, none of these are likely to happen any time soon."
natfra.225.a:0 "A wise decision."

natfra.226.t:0 "The Pétain Constitution"
natfra.226.d:0 "With the old Constitution of the Third Republic, one which enforced liberal ideals of Republicanism and Parliamentarism, having been suspended for years already, and Pétain having swiftly dealt with any who would like to see it restored, few were surprised today when the President announced a new Constitution for France, which legally enshrines the arch-conservative ideals of the Révolution Nationale.\nMeanwhile, some have noticed that, although this Constitution does not formally abolish the Assembly or create a military state, it is far more authoritarian than its predecessor, and concentrates an immense level of power in a lifelong Presidency, while nearly all of the governmental positions that it establishes have been filled with military men, on whose loyalty Pétain can always count."

natfra.228.t:0 "Incentivising a Return to the Fields"
natfra.228.d:0 "The traditionalist ideology of the Révolution Nationale upholds the countryside, and a traditional ideal of the French peasantry, as the ideal of the nation. However, over the past century more and more Frenchmen abandoned the countryside for cities, offices, and factories, only to be cut off from their roots.\nIn order to remedy this, the government has began a programme described as "Return to the Fields", which seeks to encourage people to go back to ancestral rural areas. However, initial results have been less than impressive, and it seems unlikely that people will follow our message unless they are given a clear incentive to do so."
natfra.228.a:0 "Hand out free plots of land."

natfra.229.t:0 "Militarisation of the Chantiers de la Jeunesse"
natfra.229.d:0 "The Chantiers de la Jeunesse was established before the Liberation on the initiative of Pétain's Minister of the Interior, Georges Lamirand, as a means of teaching the youth of the nation respect for authority and the ideals of the Junta.\nNow, Lamirand has gone a step further, making the Chantiers a compulsory national program with far greater funds, and overtly militarising it to include the basic military training which every young man needs to be able to defend his nation, and seeking to funnel the most succesful attendees into cadet programmes and the military."
natfra.229.a:0 "Great work, Lamirand!"

natfra.230.t:0 "An Offer from the French"
natfra.230.d:0 "With Admiral Darlan's Junta in France having broken with its erstwhile allies, the British, they badly need allies to support them. As such, the French Ambassador in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] today presented us with an invitation to sign Darlan's new "Paris Protocols", the intended basis of a new alliance independent from the Anglos and Germans alike. While there are many who would urge us to honour our historic ties with France and acceot, others are wary that Darlan may drag us into conflict."

natfra.230.b:0 "This is too risky."

natfra.231.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepts"
natfra.231.d:0 "It seems that our old friends in the [From.GetNameAdj] government have been glad to accept our offer of a new military alliance, and their representatives are now en route to sign the Paris Protocols. This is a major diplomatic success, and proves both the necessity and the inevitable bright future of our alliance."
natfra.231.a:0 "Great!"

natfra.232.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses"
natfra.232.d:0 "Sadly, it seems that the [From.GetNameAdj] government have turned down our offer of a new military alliance, with their representatives politely making clear that they cannot commit to such an endeavour. This is likely because they fear the repercussions of estranging both the British and the Germans, but Darlan nevertheless remains hopeful that his alliance will become a success."
natfra.232.a:0 "Oh well."

natfra.233.t:0 "Maurras Pushes Through Rapid Decentralisation"
natfra.233.d:0 "With Metropolitan France now liberated, Maurras's government has wasted no time in rapidly pushing through its localist agenda. Regional governments, made of what Maurrasian loyalists could be found, have been rapidly established across the Liberated territories. Due to the legislation passed before the Liberation, these governments already hold great deals of power within their regions.\n\nThis has not been as succesful as it may appear, however, as, although Maurras's localist principles are now being realised, this hs drastically weakened the central government - and thus his own authority - in a critical moment, when Maurras and his allies need to be safely in control of the government to rebuild France. Already, some opposition figures are crawling out of the woodwork, with minor incidents reported around the nation."
natfra.233.a:0 "Let's hope they stay minor..."

natfra.234.t:0 "Deloncle Requests Special Powers"
natfra.234.d:0 "With our rushed policies of local autonomy having weakened Maurras's grip, our erstwhile ally, Eugène Deloncle, has come to Maurras and Pujo, to request special powers to crush the opposition to the government and stabilise the situation.\n\nBefore the Liberation, Deloncle was given extensive powers over domestic and foreign intelligence, coming to lead our loose network of intelligence services and secret police forces. Deloncle was also able to use his extensive connections for the good of the nation, bringing around many of his associates in business to the Kingdom, and also persuading minor rightist politicians such as Joseph Darnand to accept Maurrasian leadership.\n\nWhile there are many in the government who believe we owe Deloncle a great debt for all his work, and argue that he would surely succeed should we give him the go-ahead for his proposals, there are many others who believe he is growing too ambitious, and some Camelot leaders are even calling for him to be dealt with more permanently."

natfra.235.t:0 "Deloncle is Planning a Coup"
natfra.235.d:0 "Today, a report reached Maurras and his cabinet detailing the nature of Eugène Deloncle's activites over the past years. The report states that he operated a terrorist cell for some time before the Monarchy was restored, and it was in this capacity that he first came into contact with his allies in intelligence and business, forming close connections with them due to like-minded views and aims. Furthermore, this report states that Deloncle is now preparing to sieze full control, having been allowed by our government to greatly extend his influence throughout the State.\n\nMany of Maurras's advisors are now in a frenzy, demanding that Deloncle and his associates be rapidly purged, but there are also some who believe that the report is a fabrication, merely a result of junior intelligence officers chafing against the influence that Deloncle and his allies like Georges Loustanau-Lacau have in the secret services."

Across the city, gunfights broke out between Camelots du Roi, soldiers, socialist partisans, and any number of other groups, as anarchy appeared to briefly descend.\n\nIt was only the heroic intervention of Eugène Deloncle, and the intelligence services loyal to him, that saved the nation from the brink of collapse. Deloncle's men stepped in, re-organising loyal army and Camelots forces, and securing government buildings across the city.\n\nWhen the main government offices were secured, however, Maurras and Pujo were found dead, seemingly slain by the socialist insurrectionaries.\n\nHimself lucky to have emerged unmolested, His Majesty [NFA.GetLeader] was quick to confirm Deloncle as Maurras's successor, with the saviour of the nation speaking to the French people this morning, to inform them of the last night's tragic affairs, and promise retribution against all those responsible."

natfra.238.d:0 "This morning, Eugène Deloncle was found dead at his home in [NFA.Capital.GetName], with a single gunshot wound. After some rumours of a socialist assassination, the police were able to rule out any such plot, and his death was ruled a suicide, with his anxiety over his political influence given as the reason. Meanwhile, various associates of Deloncle, such as Georges Loustanau-Lacau and Eugène Schueller, have been quietly demoted or arrested on minor charges, and it seems that his clique is being steadily broken up."

Furthermore, this report states that de Gaulle is now preparing to sieze full control, having been allowed by our government to greatly extend his influence throughout the State.\n\nMany of Maurras's advisors are now in a frenzy, demanding that de Gaulle and his associates be rapidly purged, but there are also some who believe that the report is a fabrication, merely a result of longstanding rivalries within the military, perhaps cooked up by Darlan and Weygand to get their opponents purged."

nfa.401.t:0 "The White Fathers" #Jan 1936 and then one every month and a half
nfa.401.d:0 "Critical to the stability of the regime, the Society of the Missionaries of Africa is a Catholic society of apostolic life focusing on evangelism and education in Africa. Founded in 1868 in Algiers, they quickly became an integral part of colonial society, adapting to native customs, adopting the native dress, all the while accomplishing a tremendous amount of ethnographical and geographic research. They have been on the forefront of French initiatives on the continent, despite their sometimes strained relationship with an increasingly anticlerical republican government. They have become staunch advocates for the native populations, even accepting native priests, never hesitating to side with them against the colonial authorities when needed and generally acting as a bridge between the two, earning them the affectionate nickname of \"White Fathers\".\n\nIn the troubled times since the revolution, they have become downright crucial to maintaining French authority over what is left of the empire, working tirelessly to maintain the peace between colonists, exiles, and natives with the full support of the Marshal’s conservative government."
nfa.401.a:0 "Our Lady of Africa, pray for us and the Muslims!"

nfa.402.t:0 "Action Algérienne"
nfa.402.d:0 "Founded in the ’20s by Ferhat Abbas in the chaos of the exile, calling itself the principal media outlet of integral nationalism alongside the main Action Française, Action Algérienne has become one of the most popular newspapers within the Algerian departments. Its slogan, \"From Colony to Province\", summarises its fight alongside integralist principles: assimilation within a greater France, while still retaining privileges, traditions and local laws against the centralisation and disregard for indigenous customs of the Republic. Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber Muslim population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the indigènes."
nfa.402.a:0 "Nationalists, united against the Republic? Can’t be good."

nfa.403.t:0 "Jacques Bainville"
nfa.403.d:0 "Jacques Bainville, born in 1879, renowned historian, journalist, and one of the founders of the Action Française, has died at 57 years old. Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled \"The Political Consequences of Peace\", Bainvillle exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among exiles, and Bainville’s funeral procession was followed by thousands of mourners, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending his funeral mass. The Lion of Verdun himself put out a statement honouring the life and works of the historian now seen as a prophet by many."

nfa.404.t:0 "Immaculée-Conception de Ouagadougou"
nfa.404.d:0 "The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Ouagadougou was consecrated today in the presence of [NFA.GetLeader], Governor of Haute-Volta Henri-Louis Joseph Chessé, and Joanny Thévenoud, the very influential apostolic vicar of the city of Ouagadougou, whom some whisper is the \"true governor\" of the colony. The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture. It stands as a powerful symbol of the success of missionary work within the French colonial empire and especially that of the Pères Blancs. It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thénévoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thénévoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed. However, the apostolic vicar has always dismissed claims that true power in Haute-Volta lies with him, presenting himself as nothing more than a humble missionary blessed with some success, caring for his flock."

nfa.407.t:0 "The Call of Silence"
nfa.407.d:0 "The Grand Prix du cinéma français has been awarded to \"The Call of Silence\", a drama by Léon Poirier. The movie, retelling the life of Blessed Charles de Foucauld, had found critical acclaim and great commercial success: indeed, he has fascinated the French public for years now. Charles Eugène, viscount de Foucauld would have seemed for much of his early life an unlikely candidate for the devotion now surrounding him. Born into an aristocratic family, he lived a dissolute life, eventually becoming a cavalry officer. This experience spurred him to leave his old life behind: he decided to take the vows, attracted by an ascetic life of poverty among the Tuaregs with whom he formed deep bonds, learning their language, translating the Scriptures, and preaching through example. Seen as a saintly man by natives, authorities and the Church’s hierarchy, a tragic end awaited him: caught in the conflict with the Senussi, he was martyred on the 1st of December 1916.\n\nDesert hermit, saintly martyr, pioneer of French influence in the most remote corners of the empire, Father Charles became a national icon, his total abandonment to God and asceticism inspiring many Catholics, leading some to rethink their positions on native populations and Islam as a whole. His recent beatification has even led the Academy of Colonial Sciences to petition the papacy so that he be made patron saint of colonisation: the regime, however, hasn’t waited for him to be officially recognised as such, and prominently uses him as a propaganda piece, despite de Foucauld’s frequent criticism of colonial attitudes."

nfa.408.t:0 "Sette Giugno Commemorations"
nfa.408.d:0 "On June 7 1919, riots broke out in Valletta, capital of the then British crown colony of Malta. Tensions with the British authorities had brewed for some time and the heavy burden of the Weltkrieg on the fortress island, as well as rising food prices, proved too much for thousands who ransacked locations associated with the British: when they attempted to force entry into a government building, soldiers opened fire. The crowd dispersed, and four laid dead. Ever since this grim day, it has been commemorated by the Maltese. As the British revolution came to a close in 1926, local authorities became increasingly nervous for the future of Malta, with mutiny, nationalist and socialist agitation, or occupation by another power seeming like increasingly real threats: the Germans being already in the process of seizing much of the empire would certainly not pass up an opportunity to spread their influence to the Mittelmeer. As such, the governor, Sir Walter Norris Congreve, called on us to secure the islands for the Entente, and French marine infantry obliged. Malta was granted much autonomy in dealing with day to day matters, officially still part of the British Empire but by now effectively a French protectorate, a state of affairs acceptable to both the small British elite content with maintaining their power and nationalists now enjoying something approaching home rule. As such, the Sette Giugno was made an official holiday of remembrance and hope for unity. Though no longer the headquarter of the Mediterranean fleet, the island is still the lock of the Strait of the Sicily, the bastion assuring Entente dominance over the Western Mediterranean: a large garrison is maintained on the island and much was invested to expand the defences and ports of the islands, reflecting its critical role in our naval strategy."
nfa.408.a:0 "The island-fortress will hold out against any threat!"

nfa.409.t:0 "News from Corsica"
nfa.409.d:0 "This morning, a war memorial containing soil from the mainland was inaugurated on a beach near Ajaccio. It was dedicated to the tens of thousands of Corsicans who gave their lives for France during the Weltkrieg and subsequent civil war. Since the revolution, the island has been an incredibly important bastion for us: indeed, it is so close from the Commune that its shores can be seen on a clear day, while Red Italy is less than 40 kilometres away. As such it has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and airbase from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the mainland, with tense face-offs with Internationale ships occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of exiles landed, and though most moved on to Algeria, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that paired with the military build-up has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms. Though there is no longer a stream of refugees like in the early days of the Commune, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero’s welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul \"the Emperor\" Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the métropole. The authorities, however, turn a blind eye to this, as the mafia has proved to be an incredibly useful network of informants within the Commune, all the while attending to the baser needs of infantrymen and officers alike."

nfa.410.t:0 "Louis Blériot Dies"
nfa.410.d:0 "Louis Blériot, born in 1872, engineer, inventor and pioneer of French aviation has died of cardiac arrest in his Algiers villa at only 64 years old. Fascinated with the idea of flying and inspired by the prototypes of French engineer Clément Ader and the successes of the Wright brothers, Blériot put the profits of his automobile parts business towards the creation of flying machines. First encountering so many failures that the press derisively nicknamed him the \"King of Crashing\", he eventually achieved worldwide fame and recognition for being the first to cross the Channel in an aeroplane in 1909, in only 37 minutes. A living legend of aviation, even being attributed to the first pilot’s license, he created a successful firm building his ever-improving designs. With the Great War, he specialised in light reconnaissance planes, his company producing eventually more than ten thousand planes for the French army. At the outbreak of the revolution, Blériot fled to Algeria like so many others and successfully re-implemented his business, Blériot Aéronautique, the Marshal encouraging research and development in any field with any potential to help the coming war effort, eventually running as a candidate for the Parti Radical.\n\nFollowing his death, the government has put out a statement honouring his contribution to the field of aviation and to the war effort, as well as his resilience facing his early setback, calling him an example to all Frenchmen in these difficult times. The creation of a Louis Blériot medal, to be awarded to record setters in speed, altitude or distance in light aircraft, was also announced."

nfa.411.t:0 "Murder Rocks the Casbah"
nfa.411.d:0 "As he was on his way to the Sidi Ramadan mosque, the great mufti of Algiers, Mahmoud Bendali, was surrounded by two men and stabbed in the heart, dying on the spot. The two perpetrators were caught after a quick investigation and confessed to the murder, justifying their actions by saying the mufti had acted against the Islamic faith and was little more than a puppet of the infidels. Appointed by the colonial authorities first as imam then as a mufti, unpopular and frequently brazenly critical of even mild reformist talk, Bendali had many powerful enemies. After a rough interrogation session, the murderer confessed to being merely a pawn in a greater scheme, offered thousands of francs to kill the imam by the true mastermind behind the crime: a prominent member of the reformist Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, Tayeb el-Okbi. Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the state under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many Algerians and some Frenchmen believe this is a conspiracy, and that el-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment. We could drop charges against el-Okbi, somewhat losing face but preventing any further unrest and possibly gaining an ally within the Association, or we could keep him in jail, getting rid of a prominent indigène leader and sowing dissent among the ulemas."

A master of physical comedy and slapstick, adding to it a talent for singing, his movies generally featuring a few humorous songs that then prove to be successes in their own right, he has often been compared to American actor Charlie Chaplin. This time the actor plays Fernand, a hen-pecked husband who, after getting knocked out, wakes up in a caravan heading towards the Algerian interior, his identity papers stolen and replaced by new ones: he is now another man, a new volunteer in the French Foreign Legion. Incapable of explaining his situation to his officer, Fernand is called to fight some unruly tribe deep in the Sahara desert, and despite early mishaps, he quickly finds military life much more enjoyable than his marriage, and especially much less disciplined. Now truly a whole new man, he is eventually tracked down by his wife but instead chooses to re-enlist under his real name, becoming a veritable hero and eventually being awarded the Legion of honour.The humorous tale has proven particularly popular among veterans."

Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners, sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering \"All is Grace\".\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticizing clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this \"Diary\", a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."

After numerous production delays and a harsh reception by critics, the commercial success of this thrilling tale of espionage is a surprise. Telling the story of captain Benoit, played by Jean Murat, sent on a mission by the Second Bureau, our elusive military intelligence agency, to seize the blueprints of the latest red weapon in the very heart of the Commune, this movie has it all: action, suspense, and of course, romance. Of course, the handsome captain is eventually noticed by Communard counter-intelligence, who sends their best agent after him: Elise, true femme fatale, tasked with seducing the agent. Of course the two fall in love, and plan on escaping together: as the Communards realise this, she sacrifices herself and dies in her lover’s arms, forcefully reminded of his duty to France.\n\nCritics hated it, calling it cheap entertainment, and yet, the public loved it, and asked for more, dismissing rumours that the film received state funding to transform the public image of the secretive and sometimes sinister agency as mere Communard propaganda."

His exploits are told like epic tales in newspapers and newsreels, and he has become something of a national hero, even getting involved in politics with Colonel de La Rocque’s PSF and advocating for the development of air travel. But a few days ago, on his twenty-fifth cross-Atlantic flight the aviator disappeared.

nfa.417.d:0 "\"Pépé le Moko\", a melodrama starring rising actor Jean Gabin and the already famous Mireille Balin has quickly found great success at home and even abroad. Set in Algiers, particularly in the labyrinthic and exotic old town, the Casbah, the movie tells the story of Pépé, played by Gabin, a former big shot in the Parisian underworld now in hiding, and the men trying to catch him, both law enforcement and syndicalist agents looking to put down once and for all a major organizer of the black market within the Commune. Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, played by Balin, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to \"slum it\" among natives and emigrants in the sensual and dangerous world of the Casbah. The two strike up a relationship, igniting the jealousy of Pépé’s mistress. This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it’s hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic. And Pépé, quintessential anti-hero, criminal but principled, has become a bit of a youth icon as many identify with his situation at the crossroad of two worlds, French and native, as well as with his melancholic longing for Paris."

nfa.419.d:0 "In 1935, a scouting troop for Muslim boys was created by Mohamed Bouras, supported by reformists ulemas, traditional elites, and reform-minded Frenchmen, all hoping that scouting would promote physical and moral education, character building, a sense of responsibility, as well as duty to Allah and the motherland. Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, a sense of belonging, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell’s books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys around seven years old, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford. However, these groups have remained largely isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts that would permit greater cooperation and uniformisation of scouting practices among the indigènes. Already, prominent native voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along with loyalty to France, while some more conservative pieds-noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the patrie they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria. More pragmatic voices in government argue that giving our approval to this federation would grant us much greater oversight over a largely autonomous initiative."

Composed by a Hungarian exile in the Commune in 1935, the song made its way across the world, first becoming a mainstay of seedy concert halls and cabarets before reaching mainstream audiences when it was first recorded in French by the popular singer Damia. In these trying times, it’s hardly surprising that the peoples of Europe and beyond are prone to melancholy, however, rumours have been circulating about the song: that it is linked with an ever-increasing number of suicides, in France, the United States, and the composer’s homeland, Hungary, and that merely listening to the tune could push even the cheeriest individual towards suicidal ideation. Whether this is a fact, a mere urban rumour, or a clever marketing campaign, the song has already been banned from airing on the radio or even being sung publicly in more than a few countries, which only adds to the credibility of rumours about the now-infamous \"Hungarian suicide song\".\n\nHere too, a debate has raged on the question of a potential ban, an almost welcome break from the usual political fracas.

Founded in 1930 by Maxime Real del Sarte, an artist close to the Action Française, after the man organised for a relic of the saint to be smuggled out of the Commune, the association describes itself as apolitical, simply stating that it seeks to \"bring together all those of goodwill around she who saved France in her hour of need and who so perfectly embodies our aspirations for the freedom of our nation\". And indeed each year the patriotic celebrations organised around the shrine built for the relic are more and more popular, with tens of thousands in attendance for a day culminating in an open-air mass, including numerous parliamentarians, officials, bishops, intellectuals, veterans, and officers, and this year even [NFA.GetLeader] himself.\n\nHowever despite the association claiming that it seeks to remain apolitical, and the \"Pucelle\" being revered by most of the political spectrum, many seek to use the event to further their political agenda. Both the Action Française and the Parti Social Français have repeatedly been caught distributing leaflets, supporters of the two parties sometimes even coming to blows.

nfa.422.d:0 "\"To the Spanish Martyrs\" is a poem by dramatist and diplomat Paul Claudel, a deeply conservative, devout Catholic, a long-time critic of the anticlerical Third Republic, who became a sort of official poet of the P��tain regime, his long religious plays earning him unending praise and even a Nobel prize nomination. However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of red terror, profanations, and acts of syndicalist violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil. Committees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, \"Aux Martyrs Espagnols\" calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs: it has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."

Slowly, indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become an incredibly popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club’s goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."

nfa.424.d:0 "\"The Grand Illusion\", a war film featuring an all-star cast, is quickly becoming the most successful and controversial movie of the last few years. Set in a German prison camp during the Great War, the movie follows three French officers, one of working-class background, an aristocrat, and a nouveau riche naturalised Polish Jew and their efforts to escape captivity. Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the war is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling a wide variety of themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the war ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House. In any case, it has become an instant classic."

Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution brewing in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat’s hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of \"Soldier-Prince\" and a promotion to the rank of general. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco’s national day falling on the Prince’s patron saint’s feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France’s political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince’s palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."

Born in a royalist family but rallied to the Republic, he turned down the opportunity of a military career and instead dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting the integration of physical activity in education. But de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and for them to become an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Panhellenic games, and the first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics couldn’t prevent the madness of the Great War, and following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Already heartbroken by the death at the front of two nephews, the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics, that neither Frances attended, and the subsequent establishment of the Spartakiades, left de Coubertin a broken shell of a man, his dream crumbling before his eyes. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."

Viticulture in a region that is populated in the vast majority by alcohol-abstinent Muslims might seem peculiar, but Algeria is well suited for growing grapes, with it’s warm, sunny climate. Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony. Since the exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the métropole."

He chronicles the slow descent into indignity of the working classes over the last century and a half, caused by usurious industrial capitalism and new illegitimate elites, culminating in the 1919 revolution, an event that he considers engineered by nefarious forces exploiting the legitimate grievances of the masses. Prince Henri then makes a passionate case for the monarchy, the only regime he claims could truly restore the dignity of the people by upholding tradition and the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThe work was well-received and sold well, thanks to tireless promotion by the Action Française and praise by influential clergy, already being translated in multiple languages and published abroad, though some were shocked by the violence of Henri’s denunciation of capitalism and the bourgeoisie.

Much of its collections are recent acquisitions: indeed, the government-funded extensive ethnographic expeditions in our present and former colonial possessions in an effort to consolidate our hold on outlying territories.

But it is the ending that has most divided the opinion, as the crazed man who had vowed to end all wars, temporarily relapses into sanity to find that the world is getting ready for a new great conflict.

All over Europe, the dead of all countries hear his call, unite and march on, creating mass panic and preventing another war.\n\nAccused of pacifism, of sullying the memory of our war heroes by some, praised for his skill by others, Gance escaped censorship due to his links with veterans associations: indeed, many veterans were employed during the filming of the movie, and in particular many \"gueules-cassées\", broken faces, for the great finale.

Tenacious, quick, and with incredible precision, some see in him immense potential, despite his one real weakness: fragile hands, earning him his other nickname, \"The Man with Clay Hands\".\n\nBorn in a poor pieds-noirs family of Spanish origins, speaking French, Arabic, and Spanish, having left school at 11, drifting from job to job until his father realised his true worth as a boxer, Marcel’s success story has turned him into a popular icon.

Though still small, the community hopes to attract more members seeking a life of work, prayer, and service to the natives, with whom relations have so far been peaceful.\n\nFar from being the only monastic community in a similar situation, Catholic media and hierarchy have nonetheless praised this latest example of religious coexistence, while others see the abbey as a shining example of the civilising mission of France in her colonies.

Having started her career as a street singer, she quickly started performing in cabarets and workers’ clubs, singing about working-class life and struggles. Soon, she was on the radio, and inevitably her songs would cross the sea and the embargo. Her records are played in the packed clubs of Algiers, as Frenchmen let the nostalgia of their homeland be soothed by Piaf’s striking Parisian accent and tales of the atmosphere of the shady parts of the City of Lights.\n\nSome find her songs scandalous, while others insist these songs are coated in syndicalist propaganda, but the government is doing nothing to stop the spread of her records and it is rumoured that she has admirers in high places.

By the author’s admission, however, the plot of the book is largely there to serve its historical and ethnographic qualities. Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation \"to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser\", proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from “civilized” people and that they too have a long and rich history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself Dahomean. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing a generally pro-French sentiment but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction. This decision which could have proved controversial has instead been generally met with praise from much of colonial society, though for varying reasons: where some évolués see proof, if one was ever needed, of the intellectual equality of the Black man, some in the colonial government see proof of the success of the civilising mission."

nfa.435.d:0 "The Grand Prix of French cinema has been awarded to \"Alert in the Mediterranean\", a thriller following the crews of three ships mooring off Tangiers, and in particular three commanding officers of the British Republican Navy, the German Kaiserliche Marine, and the French Marine Nationale. Their relationship is cordial and polite enough, though understandably chilly due to geopolitical considerations, but a fight breaking out between sailors of the different crews prevents any further fraternisation. However, an incident brings them together: arms traffickers are spotted leaving the harbour, and in their flight have released poison gas. The deadly cloud is slowly drifting towards a passenger ship, and the men put aside their differences to save the civilians, going straight through the gas with little protection: the civilians are rescued and the traffickers stopped. Despite their heroism, all the crews lose some men, including the Red British officer, and they are all buried with full military honours.\n\nDirected by the profoundly Catholic director Léo Joannon, filmed at sea with the help of our navy, on real ships and with real sailors as extras, the movie was hit with criticism from some who found distasteful the positive image of the German and British characters, going as far as taxing the movie of pacifism. Against such critics, the director argued that the core message of the picture is one of Christian fraternity, bravery and camaraderie in the face of adversity, despite eternally rising international tensions."

The song lists all the characteristics of a group of soldiers and officers: all coming from different walks of life, all in different occupations, many middle-aged and with families of their own, of differing faiths, races, and political opinions, all with their own little ailments, and yet, as the chorus states, \"all of them make excellent Frenchmen, excellent soldiers.\"\n\nCatchy and comedic, it’s the song’s underlying call for unity as our nation is faced with its greatest struggle yet and its exaltation of the French infantryman, always ready to leave everything behind and forget himself in the fight to defend his motherland that has made its immense success. In a nation where everything is mobilised for the coming war effort like ours, each and every one of us can identify with this sentiment: we will fight, and we will win because we must retake our home!"

This measure was necessary to coordinate the various actions taken by opponents to the syndicalist regime such as the distribution of tracts, preparations to hamper the war effort, recruitment, bribery, or discrete weapon training as tensions ramp up a bit more each day. Though the resistance is still far from being able to rise as one against the Communards, establishing this radio station will go a long way towards making sure the efforts of our brothers will not be in vain: once we land on our shores, they will be ready to do all they can to free France."

Before the killing blow fell, however, God sent archangel Jibril to substitute the son with a lamb to sacrifice instead. In remembrance of this intervention, each family ritually slaughters an animal and shares it in three: one third going to the poor, one third to relatives, and one third is kept and eaten. The faithful then go to their local mosque, and at the conclusion of the Eid prayers and sermons, they exchange greetings, gifts, and visit one another.\n\nConsidered the holiest holiday of the Muslim faith, it is always accompanied by large festivities and is sometimes even the occasion to lower confessional barriers, as some Muslims invite their non-Muslim neighbours and friends to partake in this uniquely Islamic celebration."

Since their arrival, much work has been undertaken to convert more indigènes. However, this has attracted the attention of a nearby Catholic mission just a few miles away from where the missionaries have already begun building their church. Local authorities had already approved of the construction much to the anguish of the long-established Catholic missionaries seeing their Protestant neighbours leading growing numbers away from the Church. They reached out to colonial authorities, requesting that we overturn the local ruling and force the missionaries to move elsewhere, arguing that this couple seeks to sow dissent in the region."

Next, the young church would be pressured by a nearby Catholic mission but the Protestant mission was allowed to stay and preach the word. The Apostle Paul's message from his epistle to the Romans that \"I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us,\" became a central message of the new church. These challenges pushed many to delve deep into the scriptures and diligently reinforce their faith.\n\nRecently, a large effort has been undertaken by the local population to reach across language barriers to their fellow Bobo people. Red Bobo Christians have reached out to Black Bobos living in their district to bring the gospel to them. Villages with a Christian presence have risen dramatically across the last few years and plans are beginning to form to found another mission closer to the Black Bobo people."

For many reactionary Catholics this relationship is evidence enough that they are not truly committed to the Counter-Revolutionary cause. In Algeria this relationship has deepened even further. Under the influence of characters like René Guénon, and his newspaper La Gnose, and the desire to fight an esoteric spiritual war against the Syndicalist some have flocked to the Masonic Orders, despite the deeply anti-Masonic rhetoric of the new integralist monarchy. Furthermore, with Guénon's conversion to Sufism many of these Masons and other types are increasingly interested in the native Sufi Tariqas or Orders. With the AF now in power, this relationship is increasingly troubling, with some proclaiming it the return of Gnosticism and Quietism, both of which are excommunicated heresies. The Tariqas themselves are also worrying because of their rumoured links to Algerian independentist groups.\n\nIt’s become clear that some sort of repression is in order, what should be done?"

nfa.473.d:0 "After the defeat of Napoléon the Third in the Franco-Prussian War there was an explosion in esoteric societies in France. This occultist milieu produced various New Religious and Philosophical Currents claiming ancient lineages and hidden knowledge, supposedly handed down by cabals of Masons, Magicians and Alchemists. From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental Religions and Metaphysical Systems. However, following the defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-Materialist tracts and published "The Crisis of the Modern World" in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, “Oriental Metaphysics” is a detailed exploration of Oriental Metaphysical Systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the Liberal worldview of their recent past in favour of a Traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences. Calls for a ban of the book have arisen from clergy and conservative Catholics, while others argue that it could be helpful in evangelisation, or control, of the natives."

nfa.500.d:0 "'En Terre d’Islam', a monthly academic magazine dedicated to Islamic studies, has enjoyed a well-deserved success even among relatively mainstream audience, at least for this kind of publication. Our current exile has led many, particularly academics and clergymen, to seek a better understanding of the faith of so many of our countrymen. Some out of genuine interest or hope of interfaith dialogue, while others dream of large-scale conversion of the indigènes to Christianity. A recent open letter published anonymously in “En Terre d’Islam” is threatening the fragile religious equilibrium, however. The letter, calling for the formation of a “Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims” to “pray for our estranged brothers” was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Morrocan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to “study the enemy”, a year later he would convert, two and he joined the Fransciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."

The man declares he is “the Master” of a political movement called “Le Feu”, the Fire, the “New Man” who has “come to restore Hope in the hearts of all Frenchmen”. From a stage adorned in banners featuring the party-cult’s symbols, the phoenix, a wheel and thunder, he leads the ever growing crowds in repetitive chants, such as:\n\n'Through our Fire, She will be reborn\nHer Faith will be perpetual\nHer Genius will shine\nFrance will be Eternal'.\n\nSince the man’s political platform seemingly does not go into more depth than these charismatic if deranged rants, nothing was done at first by the authorities. As the crowds grew however, a cursory investigation was initiated by our intelligence services. Shockingly, they found that this “François-Henry Prométhée” has never existed, and is merely the pseudonym of Maurice Delaunay, a farmer from Normandy, who after brilliant studies at the National Institute for Horticulture and a brief stint in politics has seemingly lost his mind.

Something had to be done to prevent red propaganda being directly broadcasted to our people in that way, and this year was finally created a Tour d’Algérie. Going through most major towns of the Algerian littoral, such as Orléanville, Oran, Bone, starting and ending in Algier, with even a detour through Tunisia, the race was a massive popular success, giving bicycle racing fans the euphoria of a national sporting competitions they had seeked for close to two decades by now.

He gave Henri Robert Orliac as his name, and the officer did not care if that was the truth. Like so many others in these bellicose days, Orliac was then integrated in the troop, once in a simple recruit uniform only somewhat standing out from his peers.\nTruth is, Henri was not an ordinary recruit: his real name is Henri d'Orléans, royal prince of the House of France. In the Great War, his father too had attempted to join the Foreign Legion but was denied from it due the Law of Exile barring representatives of the former reigning houses from setting foot in France. But young Henri, eager to serve France in this great crusade against socialism, could not be deterred from doing his duty.

Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois. \nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto. All clad in their green-trimmed formal attire, complete with personalised ornate swords and bicornes, the 473 members of the Institute have signed a common appeal to the world to undermine the efforts of these 'perverts' and 'bohemians', and penned a manifesto in which they call for the creation of a international 'Institute of Occident' to fight the 'vanguard of inculture'. This initiative has received wide acclaim in France and among our Entente allies, as well as from the German sphere. \nAs for the International Avant-Garde, it responded by setting up an abstract statue representing 'bourgeois culture' and 'classicism' made out of copies of the manifesto in front of the former location of the Institut de France, in Paris. As the inauguration ceremony was underway, it was set ablaze by known lunatic Georges Bataille, a move that was applauded as an example of 'pure artistic spontaneity' by the organisation."

The left would insist that this is a day celebrating the 1789 storming of the Bastille fortress, a Parisian royal prison and armory, widely considered as the starting point of the French Revolution, while the right would on the contrary consider that this is a day commemorating the Fête de la Fédération, a massive holiday festival that took place across France a year later to celebrate the unity of the French nation, and an end of the political struggle, of the Revolution itself. History proved that hope wrong, but this hasn’t stopped this debate from arising every year. The 1880 law instituting the National Day on the 14th of July simply abstains from taking a side, but thankfully we have since put the controversy to rest, as an amendment voted by the Assembly some years ago has clarified that we are indeed commemorating the Festival of the Federation today."

Under the unofficial leadership of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, this association of theologians, teachers and more generally learned men has come to promote Islamic reform, hoping to bring Islam in Algeria to its pure original form, away from the superstitions fostered by the marabouts and the more mystical approach of the Sufi congregations. Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, skeptical of both the sincerity of the AF’s promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Communards."

Some dare to whisper that the Comité is merely a front for a renewed dictatorship under Mordacq, and already some intellectuals and politicians openly criticise the General. However, one thing that was restored immediately after the fall of Pétain is freedom of expression: these men have the right to speak their mind, no matter how wrong they are, and how potentially destabilising this kind of talk is.\n\nWe could simply let it go and hope the debate runs its course, or we could take a more proactive approach.

Finally free from censorship, it seems journalists are relishing in this effort to tear down the man who restored freedom of expression. The government has so far ignored the situation, but letting this criticism go unanswered much longer could durably undermine the new regime and jeopardise our efforts to save the nation. Of course restoring censorship would be unthinkable, but there exist legal means to stifle this flow of defamation. However, we could also take a softer approach: by setting up regular press conferences broadcast to our people, the president of the Comité could directly address criticism and clear any doubt anyone might have about his allegiance to the Republic, to democracy."

Sadly, most of those concerned dismissed this invite, and as such it became necessary to use legal means to stop their seditious activities. Invoking the 1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press, they were accused of inciting 'offences against the public interest', and were put on trial. \nThis, however, backfired. Not only this made the Comité de Salut National look tyrannical, and made the criticism look founded, but it was utterly ineffective. The trials were turned into platforms for these men to criticise the new political order, arguing that it was at best another flavor of tyranny, and that this effort to stifle their right to freedom of expression went against the very ideals that led them to fight against the Pétain regime. Most were acquitted, other received at most small fines. It seems that in the future the Bear will have to contend with the liberties he supposedly fought to restore."

When the Bear entered the room, in full uniform, his numerous medals, awarded for his long years of service to France, glistening in the spotlight, the room fell silent, as the men who had spoken so much against him were too intimidated by the now almost legendary general to open their mouths. It took a particularly brave foreign journalist to ask the one question on everyone’s mind: 'General, will you uphold the fundamental liberties of Frenchmen?'\n\nAnd finally, Mordacq spoke. 'It is true that we live in extraordinary times, and as such extraordinary measures are necessary. This is no longer the time for discussion but the time of action, and action, true action, action that produces results, requires a single will. We must unite if we want to win, and we must win for the salvation of France. However, and this has always been my promise to our people, these measures are indeed extraordinary and will not be maintained for more than they are necessary. Democracy has always been the hope of not only France, but all of Europe, I simply ask my fellow Frenchmen to trust the Comité and myself to lead them to victory. It will not be easy, but internal dissensions would make it impossible: fundamental liberties have been restored, and I ask you to use them wisely, for the sake of our patrie.'"

Much of the necessary ceremonial items, like the sword Joyeuse, said to have been the sword of Charlemagne, as well as the Holy Ampulla, glass vial holding anointing oil said to have been given by the Holy Spirit for the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, had been evacuated during the retreat from the mainland and new regalia was crafted by skilled artisans, particularly an ornate crown.\n\nAfter swearing oaths on the Scriptures to defend the Church, maintain peace, fight injustice, be merciful and just, as well as fight heresy, Jean d’Orléans was anointed in nine spots in the shape of a cross with holy oil by the archbishop of Algiers, then was draped in a blue cloak sprinkled with gold fleurs-de-lys, given the scepter and the hand of justice, and, finally, crowned. Peers of the reborn kingdom swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said. This done, the king and the royal family headed out for their new residence, the former presidential palace in the heights of Algiers, cheered on the whole way there by a numerous crowd, public celebrations and banquets taking place well into the late hours of the night. Some important details were altered in the ceremony, however: the king did not swear the traditional oath to fight infidels and was instead given by the mufti of Algiers a traditional flyssa sword representing his new status of Hāmī al-Islām or Protector of Islam, and among the peers swearing fidelity to His Majesty were numerous Arab, Berber or African chiefs in their traditional costumes, symbol of a new era of French rule."

nfa.513.d:0 "The issue of women’s suffrage has been a contentious one in French politics for a long while. At the revolution, women were considered “passive citizens”, a category shared with children and domestics: in other words citizens who were inherently under the influence of another and as such could not be trusted with the right to vote. In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality. Idem when a Third Republic was declared in 1870. Though they were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women’s suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women’s suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband’s will, or worse,\n the Church’s.Charles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."

But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d’Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armored: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."

The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regnum Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place.

The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

To prove the princely commitment to their long-time allies and protectors, the heir to the principality Rainier even followed in the footsteps of his father and joined the French army in the later stages of the war, serving with distinction.\n\nWith Monaco freed from the grasps of the Communards, their loyalty has of course been rewarded and Louis II has officially proclaimed the restoration of the independence of the Principality from the balcony of the Prince's Palace in front of cheering Monégasques. Though a part of the population had initially welcomed the annexation, it quickly became clear that without independence, gambling or tourism, the former principality was little more than a backwards if pretty little town and opinion towards the Communards quickly soured. A treaty was signed later in the day with French representatives, deepening the mutual commitment of the two states towards each other already established by the 1918 treaty of 'protective friendship', and ensuring that the fate of France and Monaco would from now on forever be linked."

Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centers of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the “City of Bridges”. As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the pieds-noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of independentist talk."

Indeed, it seems that none of the operatives even know the name of their hierarchical superior and meetings are kept to a strict minimum. But we have finally been contacted by its leader, Alsatian textile industrialist Paul Dungler, nicknamed Commandant Martial, a citizen of the Reich. With German cash, given under the pretenses of funding study of the Genisteae flower in the hills of the Vosges region, Commandant Martial quickly built a disciplined network gathering information on Communard infrastructure and troop movements in the East, implementing weapons and explosives caches all over the Vosges and in Alsace, creating armed networks in Lorraine as well as stay-behind groups should the Commune advance past the Vosges. However, unbeknown to his German patrons, Dungler believes that Alsace is a rightful part of France and his network has been gathering an immense wealth of information from within the German intelligence framework as well as cultivating links within the armies of the Reich of disgruntled Alsatian soldiers and officers.\n\nHe has now offered us his services as a double agent, giving us access to his network to prepare the liberation of France, and we would be foolish to refuse. Though the Germans know his network as the Réseau Martial (Martial Network), to us he will become the “Alsace 7th Column”, as the deeply Catholic Dungler believes 7 is a holy number.

Despite these conciliatory words, for close to two decades they enviously observed as we spread French civilisation and built a globe-spanning empire. More than once, we rebuked their attempts at expansion: they made us pay this dearly. Utterly defeated in Africa, their subjects breathing a sigh of relief as the Teuton yoke was finally lifted, we were nevertheless forced to concede to Germany much of our colonies as part of the conditions of the 1919 Armistice. We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favorable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, behemothic patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar es Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé von Göring as head of the chimeric \"Deutsch-Mittelafrika\", the overambitious Flying Ogre only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered. We will bide our time, observing and contacting our former native allies: perhaps sooner rather than later they will come back under our influence."

The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly reestablish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources.

With strict discipline, exemplary morality, strenuous physical exercise inspired by scoutism and military training, long hours of study and a deep sense of camaraderie, Lieutenant Dunoyer de Segonzac hopes to create a New Man entirely dedicated to national interests. Interestingly the students in their retreat between sea and sky have begun to shape the “spirit” of the School themselves: nicknaming Dunoyer de Segonzac “Old Chief”, though the man is barely thirty, they have styled themselves as a knightly order, with a motto and coat of arms, swearing an oath to France and their comrades. A development embraced by the direction of the School as the romantic image of the school brings ever more volunteers.\n\nHowever, Sainte-Croix’s independence is worrying some within government while others consider the school to be slowly but surely into a personality cult around the “Old Chief”, if not a cult plain and simple given the increasingly mystical Catholic devotion fostered by Padre de Naurois.

Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading “Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France” was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit. They will head to Rome and proudly stand guard on the Tiber, representing the French faithful united as one in their duty to defend the Church."

nfa.536.d:0 "For weeks now, an incongruous and unceasing ballet of indigènes in the most colorful and awe-inspiring costumes has been taking place: an immense tent in the manner of the Bedouins was installed in the royal gardens, lavishly decorated in an eclectic Mauresque style overloaded with royal symbolism. It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honor, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty. The Republic in her foolish civilising mission had sought to turn the Indigène into a Frenchman. The Monarchy only asks of the Indigène one thing: to serve France, and be ready to fight and die for his King."

Deeply Catholic, the people of Malta were not particularly troubled by the rise of the Action Française and the restoration of the monarchy, though we were keen to manage their sensibilities in the immediate aftermath of the coup de force: this is after all merely a temporary occupation and upsetting the Maltese status quo would mean upsetting our allies. \n\nHowever, we have been approached by representatives of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, better known as simply the “Order of Malta”, looking for an agreement with the monarchy. Once the rulers of the island from where they embarked on numerous raids against Barbary pirates, a true fighting force made up of the noblest warriors of Christendom, the Knights were defeated by the armies of the impostor Bonaparte. Malta annexed, its possessions seized, the Order was exiled and dispersed. The Hospitallers instead chose to focus on their original mission, caring for the poor and sick. With one exception: an elite auxiliary military corps, mostly dedicated to medical functions, serving with the Italian army. But united Italy is no more and therein lies the agreement the Knights are offering us. In exchange of rather limited concessions, for example granting extraterritoriality to some locations historically associated with the Order, the Knights are offering to reform their auxiliary force to serve under the French flag, assisting us in our crusade to free the Métropole. Of course this would mean taking liberties with a British colony, something our friends would not appreciate, and the actual benefits to us would largely consist in a propaganda opportunity, though the expertise of the Order is undeniable.

A passionate of the Classics, looking back to Rome as the foundation of European civilisation and France as her foremost heir, the practicality of such a project is of little interest to the Master, who extends the definition of “Latin” to include the whole of Southern Europe, much of South America, and even South Germany, Switzerland and Romania, gleefully blurring the line between “Latin” culture and Catholicism. Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies. \n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany. These groups have even had some limited but rather positive effects, fostering good relations between our nations and turning into what could be described as an international think tank of fellow-minded Integralists."

nfa.539.t:0 "The Impossible Hajj"
nfa.539.d:0 "The Hajj is a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca established by the Prophet Muhammad. Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu’min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfill this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire. \n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."

nfa.540.d:0 "This winter is particularly rough, and all over France the scars of war run deep: many are still without a home, in the streets or in precarious living conditions, crowded in refugee camps. Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest  has taken to the radio to call for an “insurrection of Goodness”. Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised “Emmaüs” welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national preeminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shockwave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and “Abbé Henri” as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of a Emmaüs charity network are already underway.

The biggest of these is the Mossi kingdom, headed by the current Moogo Naaba, Naba Koom II. It holds the legacy of the most powerful kingdom in the region before French colonization, which spread its power far beyond its capital of Ouagadougou to neighbouring kingdoms. However, other kingdoms such as Tenkodogo, Fada N'Gourma, Boussouma or Ouahigouya still exist along with their kings and continue to vie for influence in Haute-Volta. \nIn this context, a dispute recently arose between the Moogo Naaba and the other kingdoms. Indeed, Naba Koom II praised the work of the native ethnologist Antoine Dim Delobsom "The Empire of the Mogho-Naba" (L'empire du Mogho-Naba). The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies. However, the book also spreads a view of the country as being almost complied to bow under the Moogo Naaba, feeding and legitimating the still very existent ambitions of Naba Koom II to make the Mossi kingdom the dominant power in Haute-Volta. This display of ambitions didn't sit well with the other kings, wary of the Moogo Naaba playing between the interests of the French colonists and those of the population to assert the power of the Mossi once again. \nRepresentatives of each kingdom came in a delegation to the seat of the colonial governor in Ouagadougou to compell him to take a stand of the matter.

Moncef Bey is the son of one of the previous honourary monarch of the protectorate of Tunisia, Naceur Bey, and is the grand-nephew of the current ruling Bey, Ahmed II. He has always been remarked for his opposition to the French regime and he doesn't hide too much his likening for the Tunisian nationalists.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning considering Moncef is the next on the line of succession to the statute of Bey after Ahmed II.

After only 20 minutes the crowd, visibly getting larger by the minute, was already spreading to all of the small streets around the square accompanied by a tumultuous clamour. At the center of the gathering was a young Algerian militant. Even if only in his 20's, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observants were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Etoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land. \nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd. This incident can't be ignored, and can't be taken lightly. It is representative of the strategy of the ENA to spread its ideas and supplies to a talented younger generation of militants in Algeria for them to start the fight for independence in Africa with support from the French Commune.

The ENA is a syndicalist party, founded in Paris by Messali Hadj, forbidden in Algeria and radically opposed to the current French rule. The Action Algérienne however is legal and its leader, Fehrat Abbas believes in assimilationism into a Greater France and calls for a greater traditional autonomy.

This rich export economy relies however on a deep divide between the merchant bourgeoisie in the cities, composed of Frenchmen but also of Black 'évolués' (evoluted) with the French citizenship, and a vast working class, the most visible example of it being the dockers of Dakar and the miners. In reality the lower classes mostly work under a regime of forced labour called by the colonial authorities, most notably to build infrastructure.\nThe Senegalese society is thus very stratified, and this is something the lower classes seem to be starting to realise. Murmurs of jealousy and questioning of the system have spread to the Senegalese working class.

His surprise was thus big when he heard a group of 'évolués' talk about how could Senegal organise itself after an independence. The discussion was unbelievable, the 'évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny anymore. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar... The lesson of the story anyway, is that some of the 'évolués' can unbelievably come back to bite the hand that fed them."

Not that they had anything to fear: according to the “prophet”, the guns of the Frenchmen now only fired water.\n\n Few were truly convinced, but the brewing resentment of the peoples of Chad only needed the tiniest spark: a small insurgency broke out under the leadership of the madman, a returning patrol was swarmed and massacred and soon the local garrison was under siege. Order was quickly restored and the madman publicly executed, but the whole strange affair is a warning: the situation far from Algiers is more than volatile."
nfa.476.a:0 "At least now they know our guns still fire bullets."

nfa.477.t:0 "Clash Against the Tuaregs"
nfa.477.d:0 "The war led against the Tuaregs of Niger during the 1910's had been successful, but led to other unsuspected problems. The Tuaregs, having being driven off some of the usual roaming lands, had been made to sometimes live in more inhospitable regions. There, unable to rely on cattle farming like they usually do, they had to get more creative. This was the reason for their attack this morning on a Nigerien village, close from the desert but fertile enough to have farms and reserves. A small Tuareg force arrived at dawn to pillage the farms and steal the food reserves, but they didn't anticipate the presence of a small French patrol resting in the village. The French presence wasn't planned, and it only constituted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuaregs. A few shots made one of the horses fall, with a Tuareg tribesman falling on his head. Another Tuareg was shot in the belly, and a French soldier was gravely injured before the force fled and left the village. The French soldiers got to congratulate themselves before leaving to help their wounded friend, the village however had to rebuild on its own."
nfa.477.a:0 "That'll teach you!"

nfa.478.t:0 "Assassination in Chad!"
nfa.478.d:0 "Grave news has arrived to the colonial headquarters of Chad in Abéché. Another French official got attacked this morning and later died in the hospital. These assassinations of Frenchmen are fairly frequent as a sign of protest against the colonial rule which has the record of brutally imposing its decisions in the recently conquered region of Chad. Investigation is always hard in a region where the population isn't cooperative and it is likely we will never find the murderer, as always."
nfa.478.a:0 "At least we can pray for his soul"

nfa.479.t:0 "Attack On a Patrol in Niger"
nfa.479.d:0 "We quite often send patrols across the north of Niger to assure our supremacy in these lands. As we don't have a lot of permanent bases there from where to assert our control we have to resort to such regular patrols. The patrols are usually uneventful but it wasn't the case this time. Our soldiers were suddenly attacked by a full Tuareg force armed and determined, they were hiding behind a relief waiting for the patrol to come closer before they charged with cavalry towards it. The first panicked shots of the patrol did make a few horses fall; however it soon was the French horses that started to fall as another group of Tuaregs hidden in the dunes started shooting from another angle. Completely helpless and surprised, soldiers fell left and right to the bullets and the blades of the Tuaregs before the survivors retreated disorderly. One of the survivors managed to get back to the nearest colonial outpost to tell this story.\n\nThe attack is an outrage but we are quite powerless to punish them unless we send a full blown army to search the desert. We will have to punish people nearer from us, who are probably Tuareg collaborators anyway..."
nfa.479.a:0 "An outrage!"

nfa.600.t:0 "Backed Rebellion in [revolter.GetNameDef]"
nfa.600.d:0 "The natives in [revolter.GetNameDef] have been armed and organised by the occupier of the colony for weeks starting from when our forces were repelled from the region. They have now assembled a strong enough force to declare independence themselves and have also declared open revolt against our rule."
nfa.600.a:0 "Another one? We must get this under control!"

nfa.601.t:0 "[revolter.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence"
nfa.601.d:0 "After kicking out our troops, [revolter.GetNameDef] has declared independence. Should we crush them with our superior forces, or should we cut our losses to focus elsewhere?"
nfa.601.a:0 "They must remain a part of the Empire!"
nfa.601.b:0 "We have more important matters than crushing native rebellions."

NFA_gets_event_revolt:0 "Gets event '§H[?revolter_var.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence§!'."

nfa.614.t:0 "Victory against the French colonists!"
nfa.614.d:0 "When we started our revolt, no one knows what it was going to lead too, some were pessimistic, others more optimistic but everyone was determined to fight for our independence. This determination has now borne its fruit and after this long war, the French colonists had no other choice than to offer us peace and recognise that their rule over our country has ended. This day will be marked forever as the glorious day of our independence."
nfa.614.a:0 "Let us rejoice!"

nfa.623.t:0 "The Collapse of the French Empire"
nfa.623.d:0 "With Algeria occupied, the center of our power in Africa has now fallen to enemy advance. Without our administrative base, it becomes impossible to continue ruling over Africa, our domination has thus de facto ended in our colonial possessions. Everywhere in Africa, our garrisons and administrators are thrown out by emboldened mobs of natives. Our officials and soldiers have to flee to whatever place feels more secure, but soon there won't be any of those anymore. Some Frenchmen already plan to flee to continue the fight, but most of them accept this fact: the war is lost, and we will soon be strangers in our own home.\n\nThe French state in exile is no more."
nfa.623.a:0 "Fin du jeu"

nfa.624.t:0 "The Collapse of the French Empire"
nfa.624.d:0 "We have lost control. The Empire of thousands of square kilometers, spanning several ancient kingdoms and thousands of ecosystems, lakes, savananas and forests we built of ourselves in Africa is no longer in our control. Our army was pushed back by native revolts, revealing themselves way more organised and efficient that we first thought. The first defeat came off as a terrible blow, but then it kept getting downhill, until putting our heartland of Algeria in danger. The situation is truly hopeless. Our only chance to survive more than a few weeks is now to recognise the independance of all of the native states and retreat back to Algeria where we can hope to reorganise and defend our nation. With a bit of luck and an efficient fight against Algerian and internal troublemakers maybe we will be able to stay afoot? Maybe this won't be the end for us... right?"
nfa.624.a:0 "A national disaster"

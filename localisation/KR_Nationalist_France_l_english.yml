# Seize Morocco #

NFA_seize_morocco_decisions:0 "Seizing Moroccan Territories"
NFA_seize_morocco_decisions_desc:0 "Since the nineteenth century, we have fostered ambitions on Morocco. Now that the other powers that have a stake there are in turmoil, it is time to take these lands for our own. Vive la France!"
NFA_seize_real_morocco:0 "Take back the Moroccan Kingdom!"
NFA_seize_real_morocco_desc:0 "The Germans have lost the war in Europe, and it is now our time to strike and take back what was ours!"
NFA_seize_spanish_morocco:0 "Seize Spanish Rio Del Oro!"
NFA_seize_spanish_morocco_desc:0 "The CNT-FAI have captured Spain, and as such her former colonies in Rio del Oro. If we want to secure the region, we must strike now, while the anarchists are unstable."

# Help a side of Spain #

NFA_help_spain_decisions:0 "The Spanish Civil War"
NFA_help_spain_decisions_desc:0 "Spain has wavered on the edge of instability for decades, and now it has finally taken the plunge. On one side, the godless anarchists of the CNT. On another, the Carlist pretenders, supported by our Portuguese Integralist allies, and a likely ally in its turn if it succeeds. And, lastly, the legitimate government of Alfonso XIII, hated by the people but a good friend to the Germans. Which side shall we support?"
NFA_help_kos:0 "Support the Legitimate Government"
NFA_help_kos_desc:0 "The only way for Spain to achieve true peace and democracy is through the true government of the Bourbons prevailing."
NFA_help_car:0 "Support the Carlists"
NFA_help_car_desc:0 "The Carlists are the only path Spain has to being made righteous once more. The Portuguese have convinced us this is the right faction to back, and, surely, if we support them, they would join our alliance should they succeed."

# Fight for Influence #

NFA_fight_for_influence_cat:0 "The Lion and the Bear"
NFA_fight_for_influence_cat_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain and Henri Mordacq, the Lion and the Bear, the man who held at Verdun and the hero of the defense of Arras, two legends of the Weltkrieg, two men who despite everything else respect and admire each other, are now opposed in an ever escalating political battle. To emerge victorious from this power struggle, they now scramble to reinforce their influence over our nation.\n\nIn order to win the fight for influence, §CPetain and his government§! must have more influence than §gMordacq and his followers§!. However, seeking influence through §Runscrupulous means§! is a surefire way to gain the §Rire of the populace§! who may look unfavorably upon the current regime!\n\n§CPetain's Influence§!: [?Pet_influence]\n§gMordacq's Influence§!: [?Mor_influence]\n§RPetain's Corruption§!: [?Pet_corruption]"

Invest_Construction:0 "Invest in Civilian Industry"
Invest_Construction_desc:0 "Our industry has managed to reimplement itself in the aftermath of the exile thanks to the help of the Marshal’s government: this has created enormous goodwill towards Pétain among industrials, who know better than anybody that government contracts are the source of much of their prosperity. A few more tactical investments will make sure that goodwill is fostered.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these companies may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."
Invest_Arms_Factory:0 "Invest in the Arms Industry"
Invest_Arms_Factory_desc:0 "Thanks to important government investments, the arms industry has thrived as readiness for the reconquest of the mainland has been on the mind of every Frenchman since the exile. However, demand for armament is ever growing, especially considering war with the Commune is around the corner: investing in companies of known loyalists will strike two birds with one stone, helping us deal with the inside and outside enemies.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these companies may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."
Support_Loyal_Business:0 "Reward Loyal Companies"
Support_Loyal_Business_desc:0 "In an effort to cement our influence, it would be a wise idea to reward the loyalty of civilians staying true to the Marshal’s side in these troubled times: a few government contracts here, a construction permit quickly awarded there, some silly judicial matter quietly dropped for others, will ensure the support of much of the industrial class and help convince those still on the fence about supporting us.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these companies may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."
Back_Newspaper:0 "Back Loyal Newspaper"
Back_Newspaper_desc:0 "The press has proven instrumental in this political struggle, and the support of those loyal to us will not go unnoticed: by quietly awarding funds to a newspaper who has backed our cause, giving access to previously unknown information, or promising an easier time dealing with censorship in the future we can make sure that this paper will continue to help us convince our people of the foolishness of Mordacq.\n\nInvesting too many resources in these newspapers may be seen as §Rcorrupt§! by certain elements in our nation. They may not take too kindly to such a government."

Mordacq_takes_to_the_waves:0 "§RMordacq and the Radio!§!"
Mordacq_takes_to_the_waves_desc:0 "The Bear is planning on delivering a speech broadcast to our nation: this could prove to be disastrous, bringing his seditious messages directly to the homes of many of our compatriots: preventing him from speaking on-air would only confirm his rhetoric, instead we must find a way to prevent this speech from having too much impact."
Mordacq_parade:0 "§RA Bear on the March§!"
Mordacq_parade_desc:0 "Henri Mordacq and his democratic supporters are planning a protest in a major city, hoping to voice their discontentment about the regime that they consider stagnant and corrupt. If they are joined by too many people, this could prove to be a bad blow to the government, giving the illusion that support for the Bear is widespread and thus making many more fall into his grasps: something must be done."
Mordacqs_Speech:0 "§RMordacq’s Big Speech§!"
Mordacqs_Speech_desc:0 "Mordacq will give a speech in front of a large audience soon, which could bring more people to his side. The government is divided on how to properly respond to this, some arguing that the debate should just run its course, others proposing that the Marshal could give a speech on the same day, in a close location: either way, a choice must be made."
Mordacq_In_The_Barracks:0 "§RWhispers in the Great Mute§!"
Mordacq_In_The_Barracks_desc:0 "The political turmoil is slowly making its way to the heart of the regime, the armed forces, usually called “la Grande Muette”, the Great Mute, for its restraint from participating in the political life of the Republic. If there was one place where democratic drivel must not take root, it’s there: thankfully even the humblest infantryman is still full of respect for the hero of Verdun, but dissident literature has recently been found in barracks and officer loungers: something must be done."

NFA_Call_For_Moral_Order:0 "Call for Moral Order"
NFA_Call_For_Moral_Order_desc:0 "As outrageous allegations of corruption have begun circulating, the Marshal must take a stand: he will take to the airwaves to call our citizens to act in an exemplary manner in these difficult times and denounce any accusations against the government as mere propaganda spread by syndicalist agents."
NFA_Make_Corruption_Crime:0 "Fight Corruption"
NFA_Make_Corruption_Crime_desc:0 "To prove to our people that the Marshal is blameless in the recently surfaced corruption scandals, we will start a large scale anti-corruption campaign at all levels of society, encouraging our citizens to denounce any corrupt official they might have witnessed or fallen victim to. This is a titanic effort, but it will be worth it."
NFA_Scapegoats:0 "Creative Ways to Fight Corruption"
NFA_Scapegoats_desc:0 "Even our most earnest efforts at fighting corruption has not given enough results to satisfy our people, and as such we might have to get more lax in finding proof of alleged corruption or be more proactive in getting confessions from suspected individuals. They probably did something wrong anyway, or they might be Communard agents, or something else: who cares, really?"

# AF trials Decisions #

NFA_decision_AF_trials_cat:0 "Deal with the Republican Remnants"
NFA_decision_AF_trials_cat_desc:0 "At last, we have taken down the République. And work to get rid of her pernicious influence on our great nation is now underway. However, there are still some who believe the Gueuse is something worth defending: as long as there are remnants of republican influence, we cannot truly get to work to reform France. As such, a purge of the French body is necessary.\n\nFinishing these decisions will remove the §YRepublican Remnants§! idea and will give another idea depending on your choices."
NFA_Public_Humiliation:0 "Public Humiliation of Republicans"
NFA_Public_Humiliation_desc:0 "For minor offenders, such as journalists who eagerly defended the Republic or supported the parades, or unjust critics of de Gaulle’s government, a more educational approach will suffice. They will be forced to publicly disavow their previous writings and the Gueuse, swear fidelity to the new government, and then be sent safely on their way."
NFA_Arrest_Republican_Leaders:0 "Arrest their Politicians"
NFA_Arrest_Republican_Leaders_desc:0 "Many politicians tacitly supported the paradeurs, merely waiting for the right moment to strike against the Maréchal government, to plunge us even deeper into republican mediocrity. Many supporters of Mordacq have already been arrested, while other parliamentarians seem increasingly upset with de Gaulle’s government. A thorough investigation will help us discern those who may still hope for the Republic to endure."
NFA_Cleanse_the_Police:0 "Clean up the Ranks of the Police"
NFA_Cleanse_the_Police_desc:0 "On the fateful day of the last parade, some police officers tasked with keeping order joined the protesters as the day turned bloody. This might be indicative of a deeper rot in the public function that we thought previously, and an investigation into our police force might reveal unsavory secrets."
NFA_Purge_the_Military:0 "Purge the Military"
NFA_Purge_the_Military_desc:0 "The military, the supposed "Great Mute" made far too much noise in recent months. Though some of our men were among the early paradeurs, it’s sadly clear that some men were eager supporters of Mordacq, and might not be reliable as officers in the armies of our King. The army has traditionally been a reactionary bastion under the Gueuse, and it should stay that way. A thorough investigation will take place, and anyone suspicious will have to be questioned, rifleman or general."
NFA_Those_Who_Slither:0 "Those Who Slither in the Dark"
NFA_Those_Who_Slither_desc:0 "There is one last place where we haven’t looked for potential traitors: the Deuxième Bureau, our intelligence office. Between Mordacq’s escape, and the democratic camp seemingly always knowing our next move, we know there is a mole, but so far haven’t been able to figure out who it is. We will have to act in utmost secrecy to finally trap the source of our woes."

# Colonial Decisions #

NFA_fate_of_french_africa_cat:0 "Fate of French Africa"
NFA_fate_of_french_africa_cat_desc:0 "For too long the colonies of France have been seen as little more than land and people to be exploited. It is our sacred duty to reach out to and uplift our fellow brothers and sisters. We shall bring the light of Christianity and civilization to the natives who have stumbled in the darkness for too long!"

NFA_transahara_cat:0 "Trans-Sahara Railway"
NFA_transahara_cat_desc:0 "What remains of France is effectively split into two parts. Algeria and Tunisia are isolated from French West Africa by the vast expanse of the Saharan Desert. A journey by foot takes over two months of solid marching. This is unacceptable!\n\nWhile for now we can ship supplies, men, and resources through the Atlantic, this arrangement would be made difficult to impossible if a future enemy were to heavily patrol the Atlantic or even worse, close the Strait of Gibraltar to our ships. We must not allow anyone to exploit our current condition! If we finish this project, we will also be able to show the world that France is still on par with the great nations of the globe and is to be respected."

NFA_rebuild_legitimacy_cat:0 "A New Reconquest"
NFA_rebuild_legitimacy_cat_desc:0 "After two decades, the fires of revolution have finally been extinguished, and France is once again at peace. However, our people remain deeply divided: some welcome us as liberators, others lament the fall of the Commune, and most are simply in shock, exhausted by the war, their lives deeply upended for the second time in a generation. We have reconquered the métropole, and it will now be an immense effort to conquer the hearts and minds of our countrymen.\n\nTo fully secure our hold back over the métropole we must rebuild our image in the eyes of the people who have seen us depicted as demons for the last twenty years.

In less than twenty years, immense damage has been done by the Communards: their ideology has deeply tainted every aspect of French society, from social structures and the economy to education and the armed forces. Of course it is impossible to erase the past and some things will never be undone, and as such we will keep the good, tear down the bad, bring justice to those who deserve it, and ensure that never again our people are tempted by syndicalism.

Though it couldn’t be called a party, after all the group openly advocates for a coup d’état and has never participated in elections, the AF has created a surprisingly broad network of influence among Catholics radicalised by the anticlerical violence of the revolution, in intellectual circles, and, most importantly, within the military.§!"

Though he had assured them of his commitment to the Republic, the support for the restoration of House Bonaparte on the throne of France quickly grew.\n\nAfter his victory against the German Empire and the reconquest of all rightfully French land, his popularity further skyrocketed, and restoration was a simple formality: a single plebiscite and the Empire was reborn.

A patriot and pious Catholic, he remained loyal to the government as the revolution broke out. After the exile he joined the Croix-de-Feu, a veterans group that quickly attracted tens of thousands of veterans who hoped to revive the spirit of comradeship of the trenches and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming its president in 1931. A supporter of Henri Mordacq, like him he supports democracy and the Republic, though he prefers a strong rule, scarred by the infamous parliamentary instability of the Third Republic.

As such, he has formed a new government with military figures, to temporarily head France until full democracy can be safely restored."
POLITICS_LOUIS_MARIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1871, Louis Marin is a veteran of parliamentary politics, having first been elected as a deputy of his native Moselle in 1905, being a founding member of the Fédération Republicaine that he headed until its fusion with the Alliance Démocratique, he has been a part of the Chamber of Deputies for now close to four decades. An ethnography professor, conservative, cultured, patriotic, a moderate Catholic, Marin is the very picture of a distinguished older gentleman, well appreciated by his colleagues and the public at large. An ardent defender of the primacy of parliament, he nonetheless did little to oppose Marshal Pétain’s bid to power, though he still often privately agitated for a restoration of democracy.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those chosen to be a part of the Government of National Unity, a new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the right in the latest legislative elections, he has been elected president, almost as if it was the natural conclusion of his illustrious career. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, he nonetheless hopes to revive the spirit of the early Third Republic and head a conservative, moderate, patriotic regime."
POLITICS_EDOUARD_DALADIER_DESC:0 "Born in 1884, son of a baker, a teacher then mayor of his hometown of Carpentras, Édouard Daladier is a pure product of Republican meritocracy. After years on the Western Front, where he bravely served and received citations and the Légion d’Honneur, he remained loyal to the government after the revolution broke out. In exile, a  man of the moderate left, he was seen with suspicion despite his opposition to revolutionary socialism, especially as he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical, so recently divided as its left-wing joined the socialists in revolt. He fiercely defended the primacy of parliament against Marshal Pétain’s creeping encroachment, which earned him the praise of the few remaining committed democrats and the nickname “the Bull of Vaucluse” for his pugnacity.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, the new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, a lawyer by trade, Paul Reynaud was young enough to be mobilised in 1914 and fight in every major engagement of the Great War, even being dispatched to Russia to assist the White forces in 1918. After the defeat, a man of the moderate right, thoroughly committed to economic liberalism, he joined the ranks of the Alliance Démocratique, revealing himself to be a captivating orator and fierce political animal in the chaos of exile. When Marshal Pétain and his supporters formed an emergency government, he begrudgingly accepted the new status quo, but never wavered in his commitment to his ideals of liberal, democratic Republic. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives.\n\nWith democracy restored, Reynaud is hard at work to restore the spirit of the Republic, deeply damaged by the defeat and the junta. Preferring a more active role as president, he hopes to implement his unorthodox economic ideas, shying away from free-market economics in favour of light dirigisme, making him a somewhat more amenable to the PSF."
POLITICS_CAMILLE_CHAUTEMPS_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, Camille Chautemps could be described as the prototypical Radical. Born into a bourgeois family of Radical politicians, a lawyer by trade, a prominent Freemason, committed to economic and political liberalism as well parliamentary supremacy, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical following the exile, appreciated for his fierce denunciations of the breakaway left-wing of the party, and willingness to compromise with his opponents. He was among those who actively defended a return to normal democratic life following the bid of Marshal Pétain for power but quickly found himself somewhat isolated. Indeed, his Freemason links worked against him, as he was given the nickname of “Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret” by right-wing newspapers, accused of working in concert with the left-wing of the Radical party still active in the Commune.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain, though he was not called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, he remained active in the party. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1889, Pierre-Étienne Flandin is a lawyer by trade, but as the son of a politician, he was naturally predisposed to following in his footsteps. Elected to parliament at only 25, his burgeoning career was cut short by the Great War during which he served with distinction as a balloon observer. There was born his speciality: advocacy for aeronautical development, and precise technical knowledge. Indeed, Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British. A man of the moderate right, he joined the Alliance Démocratique. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives. His skills as a knowledgeable technician have made him indispensable in parliamentary commissions, his advice sought after by the government and across political lines.\n\nIn short, he is an unassuming but unifying figure within Parliament, and as such he was asked to be part of the Government of National Unity after the fall of Marshal Pétain. With the coalition surviving, to the surprise of many, he was the natural compromise between the right and the left. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed regime, parliamentary and liberal."
POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1856, by 1914 Philippe Pétain was on his way towards retirement after a discreet and honourable career as innovative military theorist and professor at the École de Guerre. The Great War destroyed any hope of a quiet retirement, however: from the early days of the war, he distinguished himself as a capable and charismatic leader of men, appreciated by his troops to whom he showed paternal care and quickly shot up the ranks, replacing officers who had failed in Belgium and northern France. Then came Verdun, where he issued his iconic order: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, granting him national fame. His care for proper logistics and morale contributed heavily to the victory, and from then on he was “the Lion of Verdun”. Emboldened by his successes and having earned the respect of the many men that served under him, he was able to restore order during the mutinous mood of 1916, and when the front broke between British and French armies at Amiens in 1918, he was the one who succeeded Supreme Commander Foch and stabilised the front. It was his ideas that permitted the successful counter-attacks, his presence that prevented wider mutiny from occurring. This sadly was not enough to prevent defeat.\n\nGiven the honourary rank of Marshal before going into semi-retirement, he remained silent as even in exile the Republic descended into parliamentary chaos. Finally, in 1926, supported by veterans and heroes of the Great War, he had enough and stepped in, strong-arming the Parliament into being elected president and declaring a state of emergency. Seen as an apolitical, unifying figure, this move was welcomed by many. Since then, the Marshal has worked tirelessly to reform France and prepare her for the inevitable conflict ahead. However, his increasing lack of reverence for even the pretence of democracy has alienated many, and the future of the regime is uncertain.\n\nNevertheless, the Lion of Verdun roars from Algiers, and he is determined to free France with only a single personal purpose in mind: that he be one day buried at Verdun along with so many heroes."

This sadly was not enough to prevent defeat.\n\nGiven the honourary rank of Marshal before going into semi-retirement, he remained silent as even in exile the Republic descended into parliamentary chaos. Finally, in 1926, supported by veterans and heroes of the Great War, he had enough and stepped in, strong-arming the Parliament into being elected president and declaring a state of emergency. Seen as an apolitical, unifying figure, this move was welcomed by many. Since then, the Marshal has worked tirelessly to reform France and prepare her for the inevitable conflict ahead. However, his increasing lack of reverence for even the pretence of democracy had alienated many. After conflict broke out with Reformists and partisans of a restored democracy, however, the regime is now revitalised, in particular thanks to the influence of the Redressement Français whose advice is proving crucial in the construction of the French State.\n\nNow more than ever, the Lion of Verdun roars from Algiers, and he is determined to free France with only a single personal purpose in mind: that he be one day buried at Verdun along with so many heroes."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Born in 1890 in a well-off, profoundly catholic, royalist family, Charles de Gaulle was raised with a taste for hard work, discipline, and profound love for France. At the age of 15, he wrote a story starring a “General de Gaulle” leading French troops to victory against Germany, avenging the loss of 1870: he has spent his whole life working towards making the dreams of his youth of leading France to victory a reality. An average but hard-working student, he was well-liked by his peers, earning the nickname “the Rooster” for his capacity to assert his authority. He graduated from the Saint-Cyr military academy before joining the ranks of the army as an officer, under the orders of then Colonel Pétain. There he would become his lifelong protégé, serving under Pétain at Verdun, where he was wounded and captured by the Germans. Escaping captivity later on in the war, he quickly became a national symbol of resistance against the aggression of the Boches.\n\nWith the defeat and exile, he became a renowned military theorist and lecturer, remaining close to Pétain and becoming the leader of the “Young Guard”, a clique of younger officers deeply loyal to the Marshal and favouring the military reform ideas of de Gaulle. At the same time, witnessing the parliamentary chaos of the early exile, he became further convinced by the arguments of the Action Française, coming to believe that for France to be reborn, the Republic had to be sacrificed. As such, he entirely supported the initiative of Marshal Pétain to seize power, hoping that in time his mentor too would see the truth in the AF’s arguments, and would abolish the Gueuse. A decade later, this hasn’t happened, but de Gaulle remains hopeful that as he grows in influence, he will be able to restore the monarchy before freeing the nation from the Anti-France."
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Born in 1874, Jean d’Orléans was for long a picture of aristocratic aloofness. He was after all far down the line of succession of the House of France. Barred from service in the French army, he joined the Danish army for some time, as the king Valdemar was his brother-in-law, before eventually settling in Morocco hoping to promote French interests in the region. The Great War would, however, transform him: once again barred from joining the armies of the Republic, he joined the Medical Service of the Red Cross, transforming his French chateau into a hospital and personally taking care of the wounded. Though with initially little interest in politics, the defeat and break out of the revolution would further convince him of the need for deep reform, bringing him closer to the Action Française. In 1924, following the death of his cousin Philippe d’Orléans without an heir, he was acclaimed by royalists as the rightful pretender to the throne of France. In exile in now German Morocco, he would continue the cooperation with the Integralists started by his predecessors. Royalist efforts were now entirely concentrated around the AF, particularly as the Catholic hierarchy went past their issues with the movement, deeply shocked by the anticlerical violence of the syndicalist revolution. In 1933, he issued a manifesto calling for a “royal government” to save France, instead of a “government of parties”, a clear shot at Pétain’s regime: this would further enhance his political profile in a France-in-exile where the prestige of the Republic was at its lowest and the Marshal’s junta was rapidly losing support.\n\nWith the triumph of Charles de Gaulle against democratic and reformist forces, few were surprised that the new head of state called for a restoration of the monarchy. King Jean III now leads France as it struggles to purge the remnants of the Republic from the nation, and prepares her, the Eldest Daughter of the Church, to the holiest of struggles, a crusade to reconquer the métropole from the Reds."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Born in 1908, young Henri d’Orléans has known exile his whole life. He lived a carefree early childhood on his father’s property in Morocco, where he was found to be a particularly bright child, curious and caring of the various workers of the vast plantation, quickly becoming fluent in French, Arabic, English, German, Italian and Spanish. Soon, however, he would be with his father in his chateau-hospital, being exposed to the horrors of war, before having to flee from the wrath of the revolutionaries. This incident would prove deeply traumatic for Henri, sowing the seeds of a later political awakening. Back in Morocco, he was tutored by the best European tutors, who would introduce him to Integralist thought, which resonated deeply with the youth: not just in its deeply reactionary rhetoric, but most particularly in its advocacy of strict adherence to the Social Doctrine of the Church and economic reform along with corporatist thought. Furthering his studies in Belgium, he discovered for the first time the crowded housing, poor working conditions and terrible anonymity of the lives of the European working poor, as he was attending to their needs as part of Catholic charity efforts. When his father became the head of the House of France in 1924, he became its Dauphin, immediately surrounded by advisors who sought to shape the young man into a worthy King of France. As heir presumptive, now banned from France, the dashing Dauphin nevertheless fully dedicated himself to the royalist cause, working closely with the Action Française despite his personal enmity towards Charles Maurras, as he could recognise that the growing movement was the best chance for restoration of the monarchy. His marriage to his cousin Isabelle de Orléans e Bragança in 1931, and the birth of their son Henri in 1933 created further enthusiasm among royalists: the future of the House of France secured.\n\nOften making discreet trips across the border from Morocco to meet with royalist leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Henri was instrumental in the struggle that led to the restoration of the monarchy. In the early years of the renewed kingdom, he assisted his ageing father in every way and was often seen as the real power behind the throne, attempting to outmanoeuvre the Action Française about as often as he worked with them. Now in power, King Henri hopes to continue the rebirth of France, to build a monarchy that will last for another thousand years."

NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "After our defeat in the Weltkrieg of 1919, the communards rose up again and abolished our cherished Republic. Luckily, some of the most important figures of the Republic have immigrated to Algeria where they plan to organise the counter-revolution. Now that the syndicalist traitors have taken full control of the mainland, we must crush them! We must ensure that our Eternal France will always be free!"

NFA_native_unrest_2:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_native_unrest_2_desc:0 "The Code of the Indiginate remains in place since its creation in 1887. A diverse set of laws and regulations imposed on the native populations of the empire, they enshrine their inferior legal status despite them being technically French citizens. Collective punishment, a paralel justice system, forced labour and service in the armed forces, enforced by native elites under the guise of modernisation and spread of civilisation: to say that the Indigénat has created ressentment would be an understatement. However it has proved to be a sure source of labour for the colonial effort and is supported by many prominent voices in government who argue that maintaining this status quo is necessary to prepare for the Reconquest."

NFA_internal_unrest:0 "Internal Unrest"

NATFRA_Comite_du_Salut_National:0 "Comité du Salut National"
NATFRA_Comite_du_Salut_National_desc:0 "Henri Mordacq has formed with representatives from the democratic forces as well as the armed forces a Committee of National Salvation, a transitional authority before full restoration of democracy: indeed, we cannot allow our nation to be divided in this critical time, as the hour of reconquest grows ever closer."
NATFRA_Commisariat_au_Plan:0 "Commissariat Général au Plan"
NATFRA_Commisariat_au_Plan_desc:0 "To ensure that the homefront is perfectly well organised for the coming national effort, a commission made up of civilians and military men has been created to plan and coordinate the various initiatives for war readiness, the mobilisation of all the nation’s resources towards our sacred duty."
NATFRA_War_Credits:0 "War Credits"
NATFRA_War_Credits_desc:0 "There is a popular saying: “l’argent est le nerf de la guerre”, “money is the sinews of war”: indeed, the state must invest all that it can into the war effort and entice our people, rich or poor, to do the same, through war bonds and private investments. Our people must understand that this is after all a last ditch effort, and the full, enthusiastic participation of all is necessary."
NATFRA_Army_Supervision:0 "Army Supervision"
NATFRA_Army_Supervision_desc:0 "The Committee of National Salvation is a common effort between civilians and the armed forces, but who could better understand the needs of our armies than themselves? Some oversight from military men within the administration and industrial sector is to be expected, to ensure that full mobilisation can be implemented quickly whenever needed."
NATFRA_Aim_For_SelfSustainability:0 "Aim for Self-Sustainability"
NATFRA_Aim_For_SelfSustainability_desc:0 "Though our allies in the Entente have assured us of their full support, we cannot simply hope for the best and rely on their generosity: everything must be done so that France can fully equip its forces using its own resources. We will ensure that the vast natural riches of Africa are fully mobilised, and that as little of them are wasted as exports: now is not the time for profits."
NATFRA_Dam_Construction:0 "Dam Construction"
NATFRA_Dam_Construction_desc:0 "Our access to coal is limited, and oil must be saved for the armed forces: to make sure our people and industries have access to power, we will greatly invest in hydroelectric power. Algeria is after a land of many contrasts and the Atlas mountains are perfect to develop this source of energy."
NATFRA_Companies_des_Forges:0 "Companies des Forges"
NATFRA_Companies_des_Forges_desc:0 "To make sure we are ready for the coming war, the government will meet representatives from the metallurgical industry, who had coordinated the armament industry during the Weltkrieg to great effect, to create a new, more centralised conglomerate dedicated entirely to serve the war effort."
NATFRA_Societes_Nationales:0 "Sociétés Nationales"
NATFRA_Societes_Nationales_desc:0 "For some essential industries, we cannot let anything get in the way of mobilisation: as such the government will start a wide policy of strategic nationalisation and investments, so that our forces have all the resources needed."
NATFRA_War_in_our_Plates:0 "War in our Plates"
NATFRA_War_in_our_Plates_desc:0 "All resources must be diverted towards the armed forces, for the liberation of France. This includes food, as before the war even starts we must create vast stockpiles of non-perishables goods: no soldier can fight on an empty stomach. As such a gradual rationing of essential goods will be implemented."
NATFRA_Policy_and_Strategy:0 "Policy and Strategy"
NATFRA_Policy_and_Strategy_desc:0 "Many of our Members of Parliament and state officials have some military experience, France is after all a nation of citizen-soldiers. However, they need to fully understand the stakes of the effort that is being asked of us all : frequent reports from the armed forces, as well as briefings on strategy and logistics, will ensure they have the tools to best serve the nation."
NATFRA_Our_Morale_Forces:0 "Our Morale Forces"
NATFRA_Our_Morale_Forces_desc:0 "Unfortunately, towards the end of the Weltkrieg many soldiers felt betrayed by their commanders and their government, leading some to even rebel and embrace socialism. To prevent such a situation from happening again, a new department has been formed, entirely dedicated to keeping morale high and making sure even the lowest of the infantrymen knows exactly why he fights."
NATFRA_Militarise_Society:0 "Militarise Society"
NATFRA_Militarise_Society_desc:0 "Since the 1789 revolution, France has been a nation of citizens-soldiers, and military service is required of all men. We must draw on this tradition, on the “levée en masse” that saved the Republic when it was surrounded by tyrants and facing insurrection at home: strict discipline, respect of hierarchy and full mobilisation is to be expected of all our citizens."
NATFRA_Time_for_Action:0 "Time for Action!"
NATFRA_Time_for_Action_desc:0 "We can’t afford the stagnancy of the Pétain regime, the Comité will have to take decisive action to ensure we are ready for our sacred duty. However, unlike the occasionally byzantine junta, we will strive for transparency and utter efficiency, keeping our people informed of what is to, and must, be done."
NATFRA_Extended_Powers:0 "Extended Powers"
NATFRA_Extended_Powers_desc:0 "Now is not the time for petty disagreements and personal ambitions to amper our efforts: the Committee has been granted a wide mandate by the representatives of the people to do what must be done for France’s salvation, and we intend to take full advantage of it. Rule by decree and bypassing long parliamentary sessions for now, yes, but to ensure a future for democracy and France’s salvation."
NATFRA_Same_Blood_Tax_For_Everyone:0 "Same Blood Tax For Everyone"
NATFRA_Same_Blood_Tax_For_Everyone_desc:0 "Conscription is an old and proud institution in France, something few could escape. However, these few exceptions, no matter small their number, created a narrative of elites being affected to easier duty for made-up medical reasons; of outright draft-dodgers: this ends now, we will fiercely combat any loophole so that our men know that each and everyone of them can count on their fellow citizens."
NATFRA_Salux_Patriae_Suprema_Lex_Esto:0 "Salus Patriae Suprema Lex Esto"
NATFRA_Salux_Patriae_Suprema_Lex_Esto_desc:0 "“The Salvation of the Nation is the Supreme Law”: if we were to fail in our sacred mission to retake our homeland, this would be the end of the Republic, the end of France. This cannot be allowed. Our nation now finally, truly united is ready to endure any and all sacrifices for the salvation of France, the highest priority of any true Frenchman."
NATFRA_Civilian_Heroism:0 "Civilian Heroism"
NATFRA_Civilian_Heroism_desc:0 "Not everyone can be a soldier: some are too old or work critical jobs, some are wounded veterans of the Weltkrieg, some are still too young, some are even women! But this does not mean that they cannot serve France, and we must officially recognise their efforts on the homefront, as after all without them nothing could be done."
NATFRA_Rewards_For_Productivity:0 "Rewards for Productivity"
NATFRA_Rewards_For_Productivity_desc:0 "In line with our effort of recognition of homefront, a system of rewards for exemplary productivity is being rolled out, starting with vouchers for better access to rations and bonus pay for exceeding quotas, all the way to medals and national recognition for exceptional workers: those on the home front might not shed blood for France, but sweat and tears are a worthy sacrifice to the Patrie."
NATFRA_Devoir_France_Devouement:0 "Devoir France Dévouement"
NATFRA_Devoir_France_Devouement_desc:0 "Duty, France, Dedication, these three words must be the focus of every single one of our citizens, in complement of the traditional Republican motto of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. To finally be able to once again proudly proclaim the latter in the métropole, we must focus for now on the former."
NATFRA_National_Narrative:0 "National Narrative"
NATFRA_National_Narrative_desc:0 "The Republic had conquered her own people through education: from our ancestors the Gauls, through the kings of the Middle Ages, to revolution, the destiny of France was clear: the creation of an enlightened republic, a shining beacon of liberty, equality and fraternity. Now one more chapter of this narrative must be written, together, thanks to our efforts: the reconquest of the métropole."

NATFRA_Sustain_Plates_tt:0 "Replace §YAim for Self-Sustainability§! with §YWar in our Plates§!\nEffective change:\nConsumer Goods Factories §Y-5%§!"
NFA_Full_Infra_tt:0 "No more Infrastructure can be built in Algeria, Corsica, and Oran"

# Redressement #

NATFRA_Revolution_Nationale:0 "Révolution Nationale"
NATFRA_Revolution_Nationale_desc:0 "To the surprise of many, Pétain has held on to power thanks to swift help by the “French Revival” group. Democrats and reactionaries thought they could outmanoeuvre the Lion of Verdun and destroy France at this critical hour: they have been proved wrong, and now Pétain and the Redressement are free to implement the reforms needed for us to retake our home."
NATFRA_Give_Petain_ful_powers:0 "Give Pétain Full Powers"
NATFRA_Give_Petain_ful_powers_desc:0 "Pétain’s government has always attempted to maintain the illusion of normalcy, and had to compose with the differing sensibilities of our people. To finally let him truly carry out the reforms France needs, parliament will convey one last time to give him full powers, particularly constitutional powers, before voting to dissolve itself until the situation is stable enough."
NATFRA_Control_all_the_newspapers:0 "Controll all the Newspapers"
NATFRA_Control_all_the_newspapers_desc:0 "The Mordacq crisis has proved that for too long the government has left factious and unpatriotic elements in control of the press: with careful control of what is allowed to be published and careful screening of journalists, we will make sure that our people are properly informed."
NATFRA_Rally_Nationalists:0 "Rally the Nationalists"
NATFRA_Rally_Nationalists_desc:0 "The new regime has to prove itself to the most ardent nationalists, as many fear that it will simply perpetuate the stagnancy of the previous years: we will reach out to the most prominent patriotic voices to reassure them that the Marshal, now finally in full control, is and has always been the right choice for France, hopefully leading to a surge of volunteers to reclaim the Métropole."
NATFRA_Crush_the_Dissent:0 "Crush the Dissent"
NATFRA_Crush_the_Dissent_desc:0 "Though pro-Mordacq forces have been defeated and many now see that Pétain will lead us to victory, the Lion still faces dissent on all sides: democrats, royalists, even former loyalists who fear the influence the Redressement National has on the Marshal, uncertain of how much power he truly holds. By now, we can’t consider these people simply concerned citizens: they will be treated as traitors."
NATFRA_Replace_the_Constitution:0 "Replace the Constitution"
NATFRA_Replace_the_Constitution_desc:0 "A new constitution has been drafted by the Marshal’s government, evidently strongly influenced by the National Revival’s theories. Overhauling the decadent parliamentary democracy, enshrining technocratic and corporatist elements, this constitution grants near unlimited power to the “Head of the French State”: Philippe Pétain."
NATFRA_Order_and_Discipline:0 "Order and Discipline"
NATFRA_Order_and_Discipline_desc:0 "Sadly, we must recognise that the army once so loyal to the Lion has been one of the sources of the recent crisis, as men foolishly followed Mordacq. As the backbone of the regime, a thorough effort to root out agitators, reward loyalists and reinstate the strictest of discipline will be made. The war of reconquest looms, we cannot afford instability within the armed forces."
NATFRA_Notre_Grand_Pere_a_Tous:0 "Notre Grand-Père à Tous"
NATFRA_Notre_Grand_Pere_a_Tous_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain, the Lion of Verdun, a man who gives himself entirely to France and her people, like a caring patriarch, firm but loving, experienced and ready to make all the sacrifices for his family. The Marshal who has led us through the storm of the exile will continue to do so until our patrie is reborn e, the French nation finally truly united behind him."
NATFRA_Redressement_Francais:0 "Redressement Français"
NATFRA_Redressement_Francais_desc:0 "The French Resurgence group has proved an invaluable help to the Marshal in managing the recent crisis, and they have by now well earned the favors of Pétain, who has appointed these most competent men to the positions of influences needed to implement their reform efforts, thanks to which France will no doubt be led to victory."
NATFRA_Economic_Reform:0 "Economic Reforms"
NATFRA_Economic_Reform_desc:0 "France has always badly managed her economy, letting political passions control much of economic policy. The State must rebuild a trusting relationship with Capital, create advisory commissions of industrials, shrink the bureaucracy, reform our fiscality, protect property, and once and for all stop its ingerence in a field it has proved again and again it simply does not understand."
NATFRA_Gives_Back_Companies:0 "Give Back Companies"
NATFRA_Gives_Back_Companies_desc:0 "To deal with the titanic war effort of the Weltrkieg, the government was forced to nationalise many companies, and often managed them incredibly badly. Though the Pétain regime has been very supportive of the exiles in their implementation in Algeria, it has also often employed these barbarous tactics, with little care for property rights or efficiency: it’s time to right these wrongs."
NATFRA_Class_Collaboration:0 "Class Collaboration"
NATFRA_Class_Collaboration_desc:0 "French political discourse has often veered into unproductive discourse blaming the rich or the indigent for one societal ill or another: fertile ground for socialist agitation. But in the end, we are all French, united by our burning desire to free our countrymen. The government will promote groups advocating for class collaboration, and make sure those daring to speak of class war remain in the shadows."
NATFRA_Technological_Innovations:0 "Technological Innovations"
NATFRA_Technological_Innovations_desc:0 "It’s common sense that competition is the best way to stimulate innovation, and yet France has relentlessly tried to meddle in research and development, leading our great nation to lag behind the United States, Britain, and even Germany in the technological race. Let private enterprise and the market naturally weed out useless projects, before swooping in and bankrolling the worthy."
NATFRA_Private_Cooperation:0 "Private Cooperation"
NATFRA_Private_Cooperation_desc:0 "The State now finally contained within reasonable boundaries, the private sector can finally surge, fully support our cause and give back a thousandfold, full of thanks for the Lion who freed them from their stately shackles and moved by ever more intense patriotic fervor."
NATFRA_Social_Reform:0 "Social Reforms"
NATFRA_Social_Reform_desc:0 "The Redressement is made up of more generally wealthy people, that is undeniable. And though they have all certainly shined by their individual altruism, they recognise that as a class they should do more for the common man: as such a wide range of social reform agreed upon by committees made up of industrials, unions, and government representatives will be implemented."
NATFRA_Housing_Programms:0 "Housing Programs"
NATFRA_Housing_Programms_desc:0 "Though it has been more than a decade since the exile, many of our citizens who were forced to flee still live in unpleasant conditions, in overcrowded coastal cities: the government will buy empty land, encourage the building of decent housing, and give loans with advantageous rates to families and young couples to purchase their new homes."
NATFRA_Chantiers_de_Jeunesse:0 "Chantiers de Jeunesse"
NATFRA_Chantiers_de_Jeunesse_desc:0 "To support our youths and teach them useful skills, strong moral values, and respect of authority, we will make mandatory a months-long stay in youth camps inspired by scouting, where teenagers will accomplish community work, build strong bonds far from their usual lives, and prepare their mind and bodies for their years of military service once they reach adulthood."
NATFRA_Get_support_from_the_Clergy:0 "Get Support from the Clergy"
NATFRA_Get_support_from_the_Clergy_desc:0 "The Lion has maintained decent relations with the Church, but many among the clergy found themselves supporting our democratic or royalist opponents in the recent crisis, while others are skeptical of the economic aims of the Redressement. To try to win the Church over entirely, we will make sure to put an emphasis on our respect for religious liberty, and our hope for a moral state."
NATFRA_Rebuild_The_Morale_Order:0 "Rebuild the Moral Order"
NATFRA_Rebuild_The_Morale_Order_desc:0 "The Third Republic and it’s reckless liberalism and deeply anticlerical policies had degenerated into a corrupt, immoral mess that led France to defeat, that is plain to see. France must not fall into this pitfall again: we will work towards rebuilding order at all levels of society, crushing radicalism, and encouraging religious, moral education."
NATFRA_Travail_Famille_Patrie:0 "Travail, Famille, Patrie"
NATFRA_Travail_Famille_Patrie_desc:0 "Work, Family, Fatherland, these are the words on the mind of all true Frenchmen, this is the motto that must sweep away the excesses of the old Republic and bring forward the new State, so that one day we might accomplish our sacred duty: the liberation of France from her red shackles, thanks to the guidance of the Marshal, the Lion, the Hero of Verdun beloved by all, Phillipe Pétain."

# Action Française #

NATFRA_Politique_Dabord:0 "Politique D'Abord!"
NATFRA_Politique_Dabord_desc:0 "After months of political instability, the Action Française stands triumphant: Charles de Gaulle has asked in front of parliament the Duke de Guise  to seize the crown and for the kingdom to be reborn. Finally, the Republic will be swept away, and led by our king we will once again rise to glory."
NATFRA_Restauration:0 "Restauration"
NATFRA_Restauration_desc:0 "Vive le Roi ! The Kingdom is reborn, and though much work remains to be done, we are almost ready to take the first step towards the salvation of France: the coronation of Jean d’Orléans as rightful king of France. A sumptuous ceremony and nationwide public celebrations are hastily being planned, following as closely as possible the traditions of the French crown."
NFA_restauration_focus_tt:0 "The focus will automatically be completed after the crowning ceremony is organised.\n"
NATFRA_Bring_back_Aristocracy:0 "Bring Back Aristocracy"
NATFRA_Royal_Dictatorship:0 "Royal Dictatorship"
NATFRA_Royal_Dictatorship_desc:0 "In this critical hour, a dictatorship must be set up to lead the difficult transition away from the decadent République. Not a dictatorship of parties, of elected officials, which would quickly fall into despotism and the very same corruption the republic suffered from, but a royal dictatorship, above petty party quarrels, tempered by a millennium of traditions and paternal care for public interests."
NATFRA_Decentralisation:0 "Decentralisation"
NATFRA_Decentralisation_desc:0 "The Revolution did all it could to destroy the structures of the kingdom of France: power was taken away from the provinces, and concentrated in the hands of “representatives” sent to Paris. This proved to be prone to corruption and inefficient to address local concerns. We will start to right the wrongs of our forefathers by systematically devoluting power away from the capital."
NATFRA_Protective_Inequality:0 "Protective Inequality"
NATFRA_Protective_Inequality_desc:0 "The demagogic liberals pretended to make all men equals: this was of course folly. Instead, the State must work towards a repartition of societal roles that is beneficial to all, encouraging traditional and natural structures while preventing any excesses that might foster resentment among the lower classes: not out of a pipe dream of “equality”, but out of a lucid sense of care for our subjects."
NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter:0 "The Eldest Daughter of the Church"
NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter_desc:0 "France is the Elder Daughter of the Church, home of countless saints and faithful heroes, defending the Faith at every turn, even blessed with saintly kings like Saint Louis. That is, until the revolution and the 1905 Laws: we must repent for these errors and restore the Church to her rightful position. From godless republic, we will be reborn as a sacramental kingdom."
NATFRA_Localism:0 "Localism"
NATFRA_Localism_desc:0 "We will restore the institutions of the French Kingdom: municipal councils, regional parliaments, professional assemblies, guilds, etc. The Crown will set policy and decide what no one else could, but anything that could be decided on a local level should be so. Furthermore, justice and policing will be handled locally, following local laws and local traditions."
NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures:0 "Protect the Provincial Cultures"
NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures_desc:0 "The République sought to destroy regional cultures and languages, dialects forbidden for anything official, particularly education, while in the empire little respect was shown to local traditions,  seen as oddities soon swept away by so-called “progress”. But it is the Republic that has been swept away, and so we will follow a policy of promotion of the diversity of France and her people."
NATFRA_Corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
NATFRA_Corporatism_desc:0 "The Social Doctrine of the Church rejects socialism and unrestricted capitalism and supports workers’ rights to organise. Inspired by this and traditional institutions, our subjects will come together to form corporations, in the spirit of the guilds of old. In the past, the King protected the lower classes, abandoned, they became slaves of worshippers of Mammon: we say, no more!"
NATFRA_Clacissism:0 "Classicism"
NATFRA_Clacissism_desc:0 "The origin of the revolution lies in the Reformation and the Enlightenment: instead, we will foster their opposite, classicism, refining of the genius of the ancient Greeks and Romans through a thoroughly French lens: the stoic sobriety and wisdom of the Ancients will prevent decadence from taking root again in France."
NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism:0 "End Parliamentarism"
NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism_desc:0 "The Third Republic was weak, ineffective in times of crisis and incapable of conducting the policies needed for France to maintain her rank among nations. France suffered from a lack of clear direction, her people divided: the king has ended this petty squabble masquerading as democracy, and will lead from now on his subjects towards glory."
NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel:0 "Le Pays Réel"
NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel_desc:0 "We are getting ever closer to freeing the “pays réel”, from its shackles imposed by the “pays légal”,  a few thousand individuals, speaking for millions, more concerned with their little quarrels between mediocre so-called elite. But the real country, once artificially divided, its roots slowly undermined, once fooled by the Geuse, is now united under the king: the damage done since 1789 will be undone."
NATFRA_Exalt_Aristocracy:0 "Exalt the Aristocracy"
NATFRA_Exalt_Aristocracy_desc:0 "The nobility has given us many great heroes who never hesitated to fight for the kingdom and the Faith. Stripped of their privileges, persecuted many nobles have fallen into passivity, merely keeping the dream of the kingdom alive.. This changes now: worthy nobles will be restored to their natural positions and noble and peasant will reform their holy bond to once again take on the Gueuse."
NATFRA_National_Solidarity:0 "National Solidarity"
NATFRA_National_Solidarity_desc:0 "The Reds promote class warfare: though their defense of labour is just, this is deeply contrary to the Faith, pitting brother against brother and ultimately achieving nothing but the destruction of the social fabric. Instead, we will promote national solidarity; thanks to the watchful guidance of our king we will ensure that all acquire a just reward for their labour so that they may be able to live in dignity."
NATFRA_End_Republican_Demagogy:0 "End Republican Demagogy"
NATFRA_End_Republican_Demagogy_desc:0 "By promising equality, the republicans deeply undermined France. The people, hoping for an unattainable dream, reduced to mere cogs, called to vote so that decisions might be taken far away from them, were easily seduced by the rhetoric of the Communards. Who could blame them?  Remaining republicans will atone or we will make sure they are not able to disgrace France any longer."
NATFRA_Crush_the_Anti_France:0 "Crush the Anti-France"
NATFRA_Crush_the_Anti_France_desc:0 "The Four Confederate Estates, the Anti-France, any good Frenchman knows who is meant by these epithets: Freemasons, Protestants, Jews and Metics. Behind every revolutionary upheaval, consciously working against France, getting fat off her labour, destroying every single little part of  the true France. We will not be safe until something is done to deal with these parasites."
NATFRA_Rely_on_Ourselves:0 "Rely on Ourselves"
NATFRA_Rely_on_Ourselves_desc:0 "Though we know we can count on our allies in our crusade to retake France, our Latin and Catholic brothers, and yes, even the Rosbifs, we must not rely on foreign help. The empire is rich in resources, and populated by millions of proud Frenchmen ready to fight and die for the patrie: we simply need a strong drive for development and technological advancements, and nothing will be able to stop us."
NATFRA_Take_back_our_Resources:0 "The King's Resources"
NATFRA_Take_back_our_Resources_desc:0 "Our African dominion is full of riches. So far privately exploited, we cannot afford to let any inefficiencies get in the way of extracting resources vital to the coming war effort. The Crown will take direct control of the various mines, oil fields and refineries dotting our possessions, develop the infrastructure necessary for them to thrive and extensively fund the drive to look for more resources."
NATFRA_La_Contre_Revolution:0 "La Contre-Révolution"
NATFRA_La_Contre_Revolution_desc:0 "The effort to destroy the Gueuse is finally over. But we have never lost sight of our goal: the fires of one revolution have been extinguished, it is now time to extinguish the fires of another. So that France may be whole, so that her people might be free, so that the dynasty might lead us to a brighter future, we will prepare, wait for the opportune moment, and then fight to the bitter end.\nMontjoie Saint-Denis ! Vive le roi et vive la France !"
NATFRA_Egoism_of_each_helps_all:0 "Egoism of Each Helps All"
NATFRA_Egoism_of_each_helps_all_desc:0 "Though the king’s influence must be felt throughout society, day to day local decision-making must be done by associations between the individual and the State, freely constituted and ruled by consensus, trade associations or municipal councils. As each strive for their best interests a mutually beneficial accord will be found, with the Crown acting as arbitrator to prevent any injustices from taking place."

NATFRA_Second_Union_Sacree:0 "Second Union Sacrée"
NATFRA_Second_Union_Sacree_desc:0 "After months of political instability, Pétain has fallen and the Republic endures. After his election by the Parliament as president of the French Republic, General Henri Mordacq has chosen to take a step back and let a government of national unity headed by Colonel de La Rocque take charge, hoping for a return to normalcy after years of military junta."

NATFRA_the_concentration_republicaine_theory:0 "The \"Concentration Républicaine\" Theory"
NATFRA_the_concentration_republicaine_theory_desc:0 "From the very start, the Third Republic was unstable, facing pressure from the reactionary right and revolutionary left, as republicans stood divided. Much like then, Republicans of all stripes must unite and endure, setting aside their differences at least temporarily to make sure the Republic endures in these crucial times."
NATFRA_reinforce_the_republican_school_system:0 "Reinforce the Republican School System"
NATFRA_reinforce_the_republican_school_system_desc:0 "Originally a product of the more liberal urban upper middle class, the Republic took generations to truly take root. One of its greatest weapons had been free, mandatory education, educating even the poorest and making sure that all receive republican values. Thanks to the “black hussards of the Republic”, teachers, we will renew trust in our democratic system."
NATFRA_new_senatorial_elections:0 "New Senatorial Elections"
NATFRA_new_senatorial_elections_desc:0 "Dominated by older, more conservative members of parliaments, elected under pressure by Marshal Pétain, the Senate went only reluctantly with his removal from office and could prove unwieldy to truly heal the Republic. Though it is still too early for national elections, the Senate is elected by the Assembly: an election will make sure that most Pétain appointees lose their seat."
NATFRA_electoral_reforms:0 "Electoral Reforms"
NATFRA_electoral_reforms_desc:0 "To ensure the survival of our renewed democracy, electoral reform is needed: parts of Algeria and Senegal have always sent representatives to the parliament, but there simply wouldn't be enough of them as it stands. Districts will be redrawn, the privileges of the Four Communes extended to much of Senegal, and the number of parliamentarians will be brought down."
NATFRA_parliamentary_suppremacy:0 "Parliamentary Supremacy"
NATFRA_parliamentary_suppremacy_desc:0 "The Fourth Republic was born in chaos, and its new constitutional laws mostly officialised the accepted practices of the Third: that is, parliamentary dominance, the president choosing to stay confined to a largely ceremonial, unifying role. To prevent takeover from strongmen, we will enshrine the supremacy of parliament further."

NATFRA_le_franc_algerien:0 "Le Franc Algérien"
NATFRA_le_franc_algerien_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg the Franc lost much of its value, and the exile made the situation worse as war debts seemed unlikely to be repaid. Thorough monetary reform has been necessary for years, but put off by a Pétain regime hoping for a return to the Franc’s pre-war value. No more: it might prove unpopular, but the Franc will be severely devalued."

NATFRA_attract_investments_from_the_entente_desc:0 "Our allies overseas have supported us through thick and thin, and many see this restoration of democracy as a great omen: with promise of support and advantageous contracts as well as greater economic cooperation with allied nations, the government will attract further investments from the Entente."

NATFRA_reinforce_business_ties_desc:0 "Pétain had built a strong network of support among the industrial upper classes, thankful for his support in the exile and more than a little skeptical of parliamentary democracy. We must restore business confidence in the new state of affairs and reach an understanding with the economic elites: the wave of bailouts sent a strong message, new government contracts will hopefully do the rest."

NATFRA_solidarist_welfare_reforms_desc:0 "The Republic must show an open hand, not a closed fist. Theorised by the Radical Léon Bourgeois as a response to both socialism and liberalism, solidarism guided much of the social reforms of the last decades, such as a right to healthcare and insurance, free education, or income tax. We will continue these initiatives, to better the lives of our citizens and prevent unrest."

NATFRA_republicanization_of_the_army_desc:0 "Though the army played a critical role in the removal of Pétain from office, it is still a hotbed of reaction, as both junta loyalists and monarchists quietly ressent the new state of affairs. Though we must avoid a new Affaire des Fiches, we will ensure that little by little men truly loyal to the Republic will be promoted, following Mordacq’s example."

NATFRA_begin_civilian_mobilization_desc:0 "France has been since the revolution a nation of citizen-soldiers, each man ready to be conscripted, fight for and die for the Republic. It’s time to partially mobilise, now that war is on the horizon. Furthermore, thanks to the Pétain régime, we are well prepared to switch to a war economy: we will begin preparations to fully mobilise civilian industry for the war effort."

NATFRA_merge_unions_into_the_cspf_desc:0 "After the exile, socialist unions were banned, and more traditional unions proved ineffective, leading to a lack of representation for workers. As such the government has created a Bureau of French Professional Unions, inspired by the PSF’s own union, and has strongly encouraged unions to merge with the Bureau, something more radical unions were told they had little choice but to agree with."
NATFRA_secure_labor_agreements:0 "Secure Labor Agreements"
NATFRA_secure_labor_agreements_desc:0 "The absorption of the vast majority of unions into the BSPF has led to a large number of renegotiations of local agreements between employers and workers. Indeed, wherehas unions had formerly been defanged and isolated by state pressure, they can now count on a large support network and make demands without fearing repression, the Bureau making sure these demands remain reasonable."
NATFRA_societe_nationale_du_transport_saharien:0 "Société Nationale du Transport Saharien"
NATFRA_societe_nationale_du_transport_saharien_desc:0 "Reliably crossing the Sahara has long been a dream of the colonial authorities. Travel by sea is time consuming, while air travel is still precarious and not suited to transport large amounts of goods: a land route is necessary, to link Algiers to Dakar, to bring prosperity to the interior. Following in the footsteps of the Estienne brothers, we will develop Saharan infrastructures and make this dream a reality."
NATFRA_promote_technocratic_management:0 "Promote Technocratic Management"
NATFRA_promote_technocratic_management_desc:0 "Too often under the Pétain regime, it was not the worthy who were promoted but the most loyal: this led to tensions and general mediocrity in management, in both the private and public sector.

NATFRA_expand_the_mass_party_desc:0 "The new government is dominated by the French Social Party, a post-exile mass party: instead of catering to the politically-minded middle and upper classes, the party organised in local cells welcomes the masses, coordinating a large amount of activities, ranging from soup kitchens to summer camps. Now in government, the party will grow further and propose even more opportunities for its adherents."
NATFRA_merge_the_rightist_parties:0 "Merge the Rightist Parties"
NATFRA_merge_the_rightist_parties_desc:0 "Many minor right wing parties exist, and their efforts often get dispersed in petty factionalism: to work towards the goal of lasting national unity and to ensure that the Republic is well armed to fight both the far left and the AF who still lurks, the PSF will make overtures to both the moderate conservative and mass right parties to merge under the PSF, an initiative strongly encouraged by de La Rocque."

NATFRA_allow_militarization_of_the_croix_de_feu_desc:0 "The successes of the PSF’s youth wing in creating upright, dynamic youths, has led to a proposal to create a similar organisation on the national level, the Social and Patriotic Youths.

NATFRA_regularize_relations_with_the_church_desc:0 "The Republic was famously anticlerical, but the war, which created a renewal of popular faith, and Pétain’s regime deepened the ties between Church and State. The fall of the junta created fear of renewed hostility: the government will meet prominent Catholics to reassure them, ensuring they steer away from reaction and know the name of their new benefactor: de La Rocque."
NATFRA_glorify_the_colonel:0 "Glorify the Colonel"
NATFRA_glorify_the_colonel_desc:0 "Colonel de La Rocque is an exceptional man. A war hero, grievously wounded during the Weltkrieg but choosing to return to the front, he received numerous decorations for his bravery. After the exile, he put his natural proficiency for leadership to good use, first among veteran groups and then in founding the PSF and in government, already bettering the lives of millions. He deserves our admiration."

NATFRA_cement_the_coalition:0 "Cement the Coalition"
NATFRA_cement_the_coalition_desc:0 "To the surprise of many, the traditional republican elites and the PSF have managed to work together in relative harmony: the government of national unity, this sacred union, seems well-disposed to last, as the party involved caters to different needs of the new political landscape, mass appeal and traditional republican legitimacy. A new, hybrid system is born."
NATFRA_neutralize_the_psf:0 "Neutralize the PSF"
NATFRA_neutralize_the_psf_desc:0 "The old guard of the Third Republic has managed to outmaneuver de La Rocque. The PSF remains an undoubtedly major force, but the traditional parties have managed to reimplement themselves after their loss of legitimacy following the exile: the spirit of the Third Republic endures and no strongman will be able to co-opt the state."
NATFRA_constitutional_referendum:0 "Promise of a Referendum"
NATFRA_constitutional_referendum_desc:0 "Colonel de la Rocque and the PSF now dominate the government of national unity, their brand of politics leaving the traditional republican elites behind and displeased.

NATFRA_We_Win_Wars_with_Trucks_desc:0 "Horses have been part of warfare since times immemorial, and they are still widely used in our army for everything from reconnaissance to logistics.

NATFRA_Chars_d_Assault_desc:0 "Tanks will play a crucial role in our reformed army, acting as the tip of our offensives, smashing through enemy lines with sheer firepower, acting in deep cooperation with air support and closely followed by the courageous French rifleman: our current dispositions might limit our production capacities, but each char we have will be used perfectly."
NATFRA_Tactical_Support:0 "Tactical Support"
NATFRA_Tactical_Support_desc:0 "The use of aerial support proved crucial in the last days of the Weltkrieg, and will prove even more important in the coming war against the Commune.

NATFRA_Manoeuvre_Warfare:0 "Manoeuvre Warfare"
NATFRA_Manoeuvre_Warfare_desc:0 "The coming war will be a war of movement: the attrition battles of the Weltkrieg, the trenches of Verdun belong to another era of warfare and the Bear has understood it perfectly, and we cannot afford a long war in any case: we will quickly outmanoeuvre the enemy and crush him before the enemy commanders even know what hit them."
NATFRA_Logistic_Support:0 "Logistic Support"
NATFRA_Logistic_Support_desc:0 "Motorising our army is all well and good, but a war isn’t won on an empty stomach, or an empty fuel tank: a massive effort is to be undertaken to make sure our men never have to slow down, or worst of all stop in their tracks, due to poor logistics."
NATFRA_Armored_Cars:0 "Armored Cars"
NATFRA_Armored_Cars_desc:0 "Armored cars saw limited use on the Western Front of the Weltkrieg,but were found to be effective on the vast expanses of the Russian steppes and since the exile, providing light support and protection to infantry units and proving to be excellent tools for reconnaissance and unrest suppression."
NATFRA_Coordinated_Strikes:0 "Coordinated Strikes"
NATFRA_Coordinated_Strikes_desc:0 "An extremely effective in the last days of the Weltkrieg was a concentrated combined assault of armored forces, aerial support, artillery fire, closely followed by infantry advances, taking the enemy by surprise with and neutralising him before he could even react.

NATFRA_War_of_Communications:0 "War of Communications"
NATFRA_War_of_Communications_desc:0 "If all the branches of the army are now under one commander-in-chief, miscommunication in the field could still jeopardize our plans: we will invest heavily in radio communication, making sure each unit is fully aware at all times of the greater tactical objectives they might strive for and that the days of blind, generalised confusion under fire are truly over."

NATFRA_A_Cheap_Navy:0 "A Cheap Navy"
NATFRA_A_Cheap_Navy_desc:0 "Naval doctrine since the Weltkieg and the new dominance of the German navy preconises bigger, ever more heavily armed, and ever slower ships, true fortresses of the sea: almost as if our Teutonic friends have something to compensate for! We simply cannot afford such heavy investment, and French naval doctrine has always preferred smaller, faster ships anyway."
NATFRA_Specialised_Training:0 "Specialised Training"
NATFRA_Specialised_Training_desc:0 "We cannot field the vast armies of the Commune, instead through arduous training we must make sure every French soldier is worth ten Red poor bastards, and at the very least twenty Boches.

NATFRA_Enemy_Destruction:0 "Enemy Destruction"
NATFRA_Enemy_Destruction_desc:0 "Destruction, destruction, destruction, this what must stay on the minds of our officers and soldiers: no longer is war a gentlemanly affair, no longer is war an affair of positions with long stretches of inaction in between carnage.

NATFRA_Infiltration_Tactics_desc:0 "Infiltration tactics, that is the use of experienced units to bypass strongpoints and better attack them from a more favorable point were used with great effect by German storm troops in the latter part of the Weltkrieg. It would be foolish of us to ignore such an innovation, and with our new focus on highly professional troops we will ensure that our men are well acquainted with these tactics."
NATFRA_Ministry_of_the_Air:0 "Ministry of the Air"
NATFRA_Ministry_of_the_Air_desc:0 "The Ministry of the Air is tasked with both organising our aeronautical efforts, such as civilian air transport, and our air forces, which proved so useful in the Great War and which according to our military thinkers will prove even more critical in the coming war, as technological progress enables new air tactics and strategy."
NATFRA_Total_Air_War:0 "Total Air War"
NATFRA_Total_Air_War_desc:0 "Many of the younger generation of officers argue for large scale use of air support for the infantry, but others have also suggested that we should not shy away from using our air force to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry in a more generalised manner: we are not in a position to avoid total war, and turning the enemies' ressources to rubble can only help us."
NATFRA_Air_Coordination_Center:0 "Air Coordination Center"
NATFRA_Air_Coordination_Center_desc:0 "We will create a dedicated command center for our air forces, so that they are best assigned according to their strength and weaknesses instead of letting them be potentially misused by commanders with less experience of air tactics, and to ensure that the status of our forces in the air be monitored and controlled as best as possible, for example to mount rescue missions."
NATFRA_DEM_Barrage:0 "D.E.M Barrage"

NATFRA_DCA_Network:0 "DCA Network"
NATFRA_DCA_Network_desc:0 "To prevent any air forces from attacking us on our own soil, particularly in Corsica so close to the red mainland, we will develop a network of anti-aircraft artillery batteries and searchlights,  highly coordinated by the Ministry of the Air."
NATFRA_Aircraft_Production:0 "Aircraft Production"
NATFRA_Aircraft_Production_desc:0 "The aircraft industry exploded during the Weltkrieg, and the government has made sure to generously subsidize it to facilitate its implementation in Algeria. Since then preparations for the next war have not stopped, especially since colonial conflicts have given us the opportunity to test our aircrafts. With war finally on the horizon, we will mobilise the industry to the fullest."
NATFRA_Long_Range_Fighter:0 "Long Range Fighter"
NATFRA_Long_Range_Fighter_desc:0 "Corsica might be a floating airfield from which our planes can easily reach the mainland, but we nevertheless need fighters capable of patrolling the vast expanses of the Mediterreanean as well as escort our bombers deep into red territory to destroy the Commune’s industry. The Ministry will ensure that the development of heavy fighters is not neglected."
NATFRA_Tactical_Bombers:0 "Tactical Bombers"
NATFRA_Tactical_Bombers_desc:0 "Our military thinkers have realised the importance of coordinated air-land efforts, with infantry heavily supported by tactical air support, against defensive structures, enemy personnel or infrastructure.

NATFRA_Transmitting_Knowledge:0 "Transmitting Knowledge"
NATFRA_Transmitting_Knowledge_desc:0 "France has a proud history in aeronautics, and the Weltkrieg produced many heroes of the air.

NATFRA_New_Air_Tactics:0 "New Air Tactics"
NATFRA_New_Air_Tactics_desc:0 "The field of military aviation is a rapidly changing one, and our pilots must adapt their skills to ever changing technology: with new aircrafts come new possibilities of offensive and defensive manoeuvres, new ways of coming out of a tense dogfight: extensive training in these new tactical advances will give an edge over our enemies."
NATFRA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs:0 "Ministry of Naval Affairs"
NATFRA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs_desc:0 "The Ministry of Naval Affairs, once tasked with overseeing the administration of both our colonies and our naval forces, is now solely dedicated to the needs of the Navy: control of Mediterrean will be essential to retake the Métropole, as such the ministry will make sure that our navy can stand up to the Internationale."
NATFRA_A_World_Class_Navy:0 "A World-Class Navy"
NATFRA_A_World_Class_Navy_desc:0 "Most of the French navy accompanied our government in exile to North Africa, as such our navy is large but many of our ships are outdated. In its current state the navy could defend our shores, but it is uncertain how it would fare if someone were to attempt to contest our hold on the Western Mediterrenean. We will strive for a large scale overhaul."
NATFRA_An_African_Toulon:0 "An African Toulon"
NATFRA_An_African_Toulon_desc:0 "Toulon was the primary base of the Mediterrean fleet before the war, but since the exile it has been stationed on lake Bizerte, a large laguna in northern Tunisia intensively developed by colonial authorities, with in particular a large arsenal in Ferryville. To meet our ambitions, Bizerte will be overhauled and developed further."
NATFRA_Heavy_Destroyers:0 "Heavy Destroyers"
NATFRA_Heavy_Destroyers_desc:0 "France’s navy has always been developed with the assumption that it would fight a superior force. In the last century, a movement called the “Jeune École” advocated for the use of many smaller ships instead of large dreadnoughts: this idea is now outdated. The ministry will instead encourage the development of well-armed destroyers, a middle ground between our traditional doctrines and the international trends."
NATFRA_Aviation_Cruisers:0 "Aviation Cruisers"
NATFRA_Aviation_Cruisers_desc:0 "The field of naval aviation has been somewhat left behind by the international community, locked in a permanent arms race: this is a race we could not win, instead we will radically change our doctrine and encourage the use of air power in naval warfare, for reconnaissance and precision strikes."
NATFRA_Sea_Leviathans:0 "Sea Leviathans"
NATFRA_Sea_Leviathans_desc:0 "We might not be able to compete with Germany or Japan in the naval arms race, but we certainly can attempt to knock out any of our Mediterrean opponents with well armed heavy battleships: this might go against previous doctrines, but our current situation means it is time for some innovation."
NATFRA_Air_Carriers:0 "Air Carriers"
NATFRA_Air_Carriers_desc:0 "The current naval arms race is misguided: by developing aircraft carriers, we will ensure that we can keep control over the Meditterean by bombing our enemies and sinking them to the depths of the sea before we are even within range of their guns."
NATFRA_Preparing_Our_Return:0 "Preparing Our Return"
NATFRA_Preparing_Our_Return_desc:0 "To reconquer the métropole, we need to land on its shore, a fight that the Commune has been expecting for two decennies: it will be anything but simple. We must prepare as much as we can, as there will be no second chance. The Ministry will invest in the development of anything that could help our amphibious assault."
NATFRA_Invasion_Logistics:0 "Invasion Logistics"
NATFRA_Invasion_Logistics_desc:0 "However, the amphibious assault is merely the first part, we must ensure that our troops can secure a lasting bridgehead. And for this, there is only one way to prepare: impeccable logistics, so that the men lucky enough to be the first to set foot on the sacred soil of the Patrie can hold back any counterattack the Communards might attempt."
NATFRA_The_U_Boat_Menace:0 "Develop the Forces Sous-Marines"
NATFRA_The_U_Boat_Menace_desc:0 "The Commune lacks many resources essential to the modern war effort, most importantly, oil. Keeping control of the Mediterranean will be a strong step towards isolating them from their allies or neutral states willing to trade with them, but a large fleet of submarines will give us the capacity to harass their convoys even more efficiently."
NATFRA_Battaile_Escadres:0 "Bataille d'Escadres"
NATFRA_Battaile_Escadres_desc:0 "The battle for the Mediterranean won’t be won with a single engagement, and we need to think strategically. By creating task forces, we will ensure our ships have clear roles and that they will be easily more coordinated, and our naval commanders will be taught how to think on a larger scale."

NATFRA_Colonial_Extraction_desc:0 "While some believed that we ought to ease the burdens on our colonial populace due to our shared circumstance of our exile, that plan is foolhardy.

NATFRA_Rebuild_North_desc:0 "The bulk of the French industry is in the north of the country, on top of its coal and metal mines, and all roads and railroads lead to Paris. Already damaged by the heavy fighting of the Weltkrieg, the recent conflict was certainly not kind either to the region. Our rebuilding efforts must be intensified to ensure France is ready to stand tall as an economic power once again."

NATFRA_Prepare_For_War_desc:0 "The Boches have proved time and time again that they are forever the enemies of the people of France. The atrocities they committed against us in the last two wars and their current attitude make any hope of reconciliation null. If a third war is needed, we will be ready to avenge our heroes and destroy the monstrous chimaera known as Germany!"
NATFRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine:0 "Demand the Return of Alsace-Lorraine" #Make this better than Alsace or War
NATFRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine_desc:0 "Since 1870, the Germans have occupied the French territory of Alsace-Lorraine. We must right this wrong and demand that it be surrendered to France! If the Germans refuse our terms, we will have no choice but to renew our fury against these enemies of peace and civilization!"
NATFRA_English_Doctrine:0 "Joint Franco-British Naval Strategy?" #Request Naval Doctrine from ENT leader
NATFRA_English_Doctrine_desc:0 "Long have the British ruled the seas. With our friendship and alliance between our two nations, we have the opportunity to request the aid of some naval experts to help teach us their tactics and work together to ensure better coordination between our task forces in any joint operations that we undertake in the future."

NATFRA_Kings_Made_France:0 "The Kings Made France..."
NATFRA_Kings_Made_France_desc:0 "France was born in 508 with the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks: since then, his descendants have reigned upon France and led her countless times to glory. France was built by the tireless efforts of her kings, and without them she was nothing: orphaned, she erred and fell. But this tragedy is over, long live the King!"
NATFRA_Pays_Naturels:0 "Recognize the Pays Naturels"
NATFRA_Pays_Naturels_desc:0 "In an effort to destroy the true France, the Republicans in their manic obsession with rationality created entirely artificial administrative subdivisions, denying any local identities, dialects and traditions, going as far as imposing the Parisian dialect as “proper” French. We will undo this injustice and recognize the various natural and cultural regions within France."
NATFRA_Province_Parliament:0 "Restore the Provincial Parliaments"
NATFRA_Province_Parliament_desc:0 "The realm had traditionally been divided between various provinces, each with their own assemblies tasked with administering their area according to local rights and privileges, ensuring that each part of France was ruled in a perfectly tailored way. These provincial parliaments were of course abolished by the Revolution, ending centuries of harmonious autonomy: they will be restored."
NATFRA_Expand_Camelot:0 "Expand the Camelots"
NATFRA_Expand_Camelot_desc:0 "The Camelots du Roi, youths originally tasked with selling the Action Française newspaper, have evolved into an intensely loyal paramilitary force. By making membership mandatory for youngsters and organising youth camps inspired by scouting to teach useful skills as well as instill strong religious values and respect of authority, we will be able to undo the damage inflicted by the Commune upon the young generation."
NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny:0 "Authority not Tyranny"
NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny_desc:0 "Much like subordination is not slavery, authority must not be tyranny. The King must and will be akin to a loving father, firm when needed, ready to give impartial justice, but otherwise leaving his children, the people, free to enjoy their natural rights and exercise their traditional privileges and freedoms."
NATFRA_Honour_House_France:0 "Glorify the House of France"
NATFRA_Honour_House_France_desc:0 "The House of France, that is the royal family, have proved time and time again their personal qualities. Brave, pious, intelligent, caring, each a worthy descendant of Saint Louis and model for all of us. Some of our freed countrymen might still be coming to terms with the restored monarchy, we must make sure they know how lucky they are to be once again led by the Dynasty."
NATFRA_Social_Doctrine:0 "Enforce the Social Doctrine"
NATFRA_Social_Doctrine_desc:0 "The Social Doctrine of the Church is a wide ranging compendium of teachings related to the Common Good of society. More than political ideas, they are a moral imperative for any true Catholic to follow, demanding subsidiarity, solidarity, and human dignity. As the monarch of the Eldest Daughter of the Church, the king will ensure that these principles are scrupulously followed by all."
NATFRA_Consecrate_Heart:0 "Consecration to the Immaculate Heart"
NATFRA_Consecrate_Heart_desc:0 "Since 1638, France has been consecrated to the Virgin Mary, now eternal Queen of France. But to show our gratitude towards the Holy Mother for her protection which permitted us to reconquer her kingdom, we will renew this vow, this time consecrating the realm to her Immaculate Heart, symbol of her compassionate love for all people."
NATFRA_Blame_et_Accuse:0 "Blame the Gueuse, Accuse the Boches"
NATFRA_Blame_et_Accuse_desc:0 "Because of the pathetic elites of the Republic, the war was lost. Then, much like the Germans had encouraged the existence of the Gueuse to weaken France in 1871, they inoculated the nation with the socialist plague during the Great War. They wanted France weak and divided: no more! The king has finally returned, our misled people have awoken, and the Anti-France, republican or syndicalist, has been cast out."
NATFRA_Coopt_Cercle_Proudhon:0 "Found the Cercle Proudhon"
NATFRA_Coopt_Cercle_Proudhon_desc:0 "We will create a "Cercle Proudhon", a think-tank made up of National-Syndicalist leaders inspired by the works of Proudhon, Sorel, and more surprisingly, Charles Maurras. They are the most amiable of the syndicalist factions: we will make use of their popularity to help our people make peace with the new order."
NATFRA_Prole_no_More:0 "Proletarians no More!"
NATFRA_Prole_no_More_desc:0 "The 1789 Revolution stripped our people of their traditional rights and privileges, turning them into an exploited class, the proletariat at the mercy of Capital. The Anti-France capitalised on their righteous anger, leading them further astray. No more! Their rights restored, there is no longer a single proletarian in France, only proud artisans, proud peasants, proud workers."
NATFRA_Integral_Monarch:0 "The King Saved Her!"
NATFRA_Integral_Monarch_desc:0 "The real France has long suffered under the tyranny of her enemies, whether they be parasitic republicans or ungodly socialists. Much work remains to be done to undo the damage, but the nation is finally recovering under the caring and watchful guidance of her rightful monarch.\nVive le Roi! Vive la France!"

NATFRA_Marshal_Triumph:0 "The Marshal Triumphant"
NATFRA_Marshal_Triumph_desc:0 "The Lion, hero of Verdun, who has led France in her darkest hour now stands victorious. His regime, once so decried, has proven itself to be the salvation of France. No one would dare to question the Marshal or his allies of the Redressement Français after accomplishing such a feat, and they are free to reform France according to their agendas."
NATFRA_Remember_Verdun:0 "Rekindle the Memory of Verdun"
NATFRA_Remember_Verdun_desc:0 "Though Pétain has been viciously slandered by Communard propaganda for years, even this effort could not make Frenchmen forget that he is the man who led them towards victory at Verdun and greatly improved living conditions at the front. An entire generation still vividly remembers his fateful call: “They shall not pass!”. We will make full use of this to reconcile our people with the new regime."
NATFRA_Restore_Religious_Freedom:0 "Restore Religious Freedom"
NATFRA_Restore_Religious_Freedom_desc:0 "The deeply anticlerical leftists sought to break the Church. Though state atheism was too much of a risk for the Communards to take, the faithful were derided and bombarded with propaganda, religious education was banned, and public expression of religion was hardly constrained. No more: though France remains a secular state, this antagonisation of religion will immediately stop."
NATFRA_Incentivise_Philanthropy:0 "Incentivize Philanthropy"
NATFRA_Incentivise_Philanthropy_desc:0 "The State will always be inefficient to meet the people’s needs, and a welfare state would only encourage parasitism: instead the more philanthropic among our people will be encouraged by tax breaks and honours to donate to and care for the needy, so that one day state socialism will be fully dismantled."
NATFRA_Denounce_Party_Politics:0 "Denounce Party Politics"
NATFRA_Denounce_Party_Politics_desc:0 "The Third Republic fell into instability, which led us to our defeat in the Weltkrieg, while the Marshal had to put a stop to the petty infighting of the exiled Fourth Republic. Clearly, party politics are to blame for much of this, as individuals chose their group interests over what was best for France. Elected officials will no longer affiliate with parties, and instead will have to shine of their own merit."
NATFRA_Perm_Advisors:0 "Apolitical Permanent Advisors"
NATFRA_Perm_Advisors_desc:0 "Too often, the French governments and lawmakers put in place legislation without knowing the first thing about the topic in question, whether that be industry, science or the economy. As such the Marshal will appoint permanent, apolitical technical advisors to every committee, every commission, to ensure that the uninformed mistakes of the past do not occur again."
NATFRA_Electoral_System:0 "Streamlined Electoral System"
NATFRA_Electoral_System_desc:0 "The Republican electoral system was far too prone to being abused by the whims of a people easily whisked into frenzy. To prevent the instability that led to the downfall of France, we will deeply reform it. Longer mandates, less MPs, merely partial renewal of parliament, of course empowering the executive or creating a Supreme Court will surely make for more rational politics."
NATFRA_Disinterested_Experts:0 "A Government of Disinterested Experts"
NATFRA_Disinterested_Experts_desc:0 "No longer will France be run into the ground by inept professional politicians, instead it will thrive under the guidance of pragmatic men, free from the influence of any parties, no longer slaves to political passions, who have worked and succeeded on their own before being called to serve France."
NATFRA_Dismantle_Red_Virus:0 "Dismantle the Red Virus"
NATFRA_Dismantle_Red_Virus_desc:0 "Like an insidious malady, socialism has spread over the last century in French consciousnesses, from deranged intellectuals, to politicians, to the humblest of laborers. It first led to economic stagnancy, then instability, and finally revolution and civil war. If we want to avoid reliving the same nightmare, this red plague must be fought in every aspect of life, meticulously rooted out."
NATFRA_Admin_Reorg:0 "Administrative Reorganization"
NATFRA_Admin_Reorg_desc:0 "The pre-war administration was simply a waste. Too many subdivisions, too many bureaucrats, using too many resources and creating too many regulations, which led to increased taxes, less productivity, less production. Simply put, administrative red tape merely stifled the best and brightest while only increasing the burden on others: it’s time to cut it down to the minimum."
NATFRA_End_State_Meddle:0 "End State Meddling"
NATFRA_End_State_Meddle_desc:0 "The French Republic has countless times pathetically attempted to participate in the economy, leading more often than not to embarrassing failure: bureaucrats who have hardly ever held a real job are simply not well versed in the subtle art of profit. It’s time to end this masquerade and restrict the role of the state to what it does best: hold up the rule of Law."
NATFRA_Marshal_Above_Liberty_Below:0 "Marshal Above, \nLiberty Below"
NATFRA_Marshal_Above_Liberty_Below_desc:0 "Thanks to the caring guidance of the Lion, France is ready to go forward. Much work remains to be done, but Frenchmen can finally rest easy, knowing that the brightest and most competent minds of our era have been assembled to undo the damage done by syndicalism and avoid the errors of the bloated quasi-socialist Third Republic. Never again will the rule of law be threatened."

NATFRA_Republic_In_Charge_desc:0 "After years of struggle at home and abroad against tyranny, the French Republic is one and indivisible again. Much remains to be done, but the free people of the world can celebrate this triumph of democracy and liberty!"
NATFRA_Prepare_New_Elections:0 "Prepare New Elections"
NATFRA_Prepare_New_Elections_desc:0 "The mainland reconquered, we must show that our promises of democracy were true. The French people will express their sovereign will in the first legislative elections in years, so that their representatives may be elected and get to work on the arduous task of rebuilding our nation."
NATFRA_Colonel_Coup:0 "The Colonel's Gambit"
NATFRA_Colonel_Coup_desc:0 "France is still deeply unstable: parliamentarism is what led her to her downfall more than two decades ago, and we will not make the same mistake again. To ensure the future stability of the Republic, de La Rocque has appealed to the heroes of the reconquest and stepped in to maintain order until a new, more stable democracy is crafted."
NATFRA_Radical_Reconciliation:0 "Radical Reconciliation"
NATFRA_Radical_Reconciliation_desc:0 "The left-wing of the Radical party had backed the revolution, before being largely sidelined by more radical socialists. They have now seen the errors in their ways and the reunited Radicals have won the day: social reform will help our people more smoothly transition back to republicanism."
NATFRA_Maintain_Concentration:0 "Maintain the Concentration"
NATFRA_Maintain_Concentration_desc:0 "To protect the reunited Republic against radicalism and tyranny from both right and left, moderate Republicans have formed a broad moderate coalition and won the day, ensuring a return to normalcy after decades of troubles: the spirit of the Third Republic lives on."
NATFRA_Revive_National_Bloc:0 "Revive the National Bloc"
NATFRA_Revive_National_Bloc_desc:0 "It is the duty of every Frenchman to stand tall against the ever-lurking socialist threat: a broad coalition of right-wing parties, from more traditional Catholics conservatives to the PSF, has won the day, decisively showing that our people want to once and for all put behind them the errors of the past."
NATFRA_Maintain_Military_Rule:0 "Maintain Military Rule"
NATFRA_Maintain_Military_Rule_desc:0 "France is simply not yet ready to return to democracy, too many threats seeking to tear apart the Republic are lurking. Our armed forces so recently crowned with the laurels of victory will temporarily hold on to power until stability is fully restored and democratic life can safely resume."

NATFRA_Administrative_Decentralization:0 "Administrative Decentralization"
NATFRA_Administrative_Decentralization_desc:0 "Attempting to undo decades of syndicalist efforts in decentralisation would be simply foolish: while France has since the dawn of the Republic been a very centralised nation, there is nothing stopping us from simply adapting to this new status quo, and reform it to better fit the restored order."
NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms:0 "Legitimize Reformist Unions"
NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms_desc:0 "Denied reform, workers turned to violence and class warfare in the hope of bettering their conditions, and thus was born the revolution. To prevent such tragedy, dialogue between capital and labour must happen and reform must be possible: unions that officially renounce revolutionary rhetoric will be welcomed back within workplaces, even if they profess some form of socialism."
NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws:0 "Negotiate New Labor Laws"
NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws_desc:0 "Under the auspices of the government, labour and capital, as well as representatives from various parties and interest groups, have joined together to discuss reforms to labour laws, often sidestepped in the wake of the syndicalist defeat. Our people can and must be confident in the Republic’s tireless defence of their interests."
NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty:0 "Abolish the Death Penalty"
NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty_desc:0 "In 1791 already our forefathers had passionate debates relating to the end of capital punishment, and since then our great men, such as Hugo, Gambetta, Clemenceau, Jaurès have tirelessly advocated for the abolition of the death penalty. It is finally time to take this step forward: the bloodlust of the guillotine has been satiated by these decades of fratricidal conflict."
NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services:0 "Nationalize Public Services"
NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services_desc:0 "Desyndicalisation has occasionally strayed zealously and aggressively far, in some domains leading to a drop in quality of life of our citizens: to correct this error, some public services will be nationalised, in order to deploy them according to the public interest and not profit."
NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms:0 "Expand Welfare Reforms"
NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms_desc:0 "Continuing and expanding the solidaristic welfare programs in the vein of the Radical traditions will ensure that our people, still reeling from the war and struggling to rebuild our nation, will still be able to live decently and won’t find themselves falling into nostalgia for the syndicalist regime."

NATFRA_Protect_Secular_Traditions:0 "Protect Secular Traditions"
NATFRA_Protect_Secular_Traditions_desc:0 "The 1905 laws on the Separation of the Churches and the State enshrined laïcité, strict secularism, as one of the pillars of the French Republic. This document, widely decried but ultimately born out of a spirit of conciliation, will be restored, ensuring that neither religious obscurantism nor far-left anticlericalism prevents the Republic from moving forward."
NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos:0 "Disband the Dispos"
NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos_desc:0 "The PSF’s security service, the “Dispos” have teetered on the brink of paramilitarism for too long: they have had their use in defending our fledgeling reborn democracy, but we cannot tolerate that private citizens attempt to bypass legitimate law enforcement to maintain order. We will contact de La Rocque so that they can be quietly disbanded."
NATFRA_Reinstitute_Republican_School:0 "Reinstitute the Republican School"
NATFRA_Reinstitute_Republican_School_desc:0 "When the Republic was still young and fragile, it’s mandatory, free education that solidified her position and conquered the hearts and minds of the French nation to Republican values and ideals. The Republic might be triumphant now, but much remains to be done to heal the scars of the last decades, and once again schools will be a critical battleground of ideas."
NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech:0 "Enshrine Freedom of Speech"
NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech_desc:0 "One of the fundamental rights outlined by the 1789 Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen was freedom of speech. Since then, this right has often been contested: both Communard authorities and the Pétain junta made liberal use of censorship, but no more! Freedom of speech shall be exalted as one of the pillars of the Republic."

NATFRA_Reorganize_the_Departments:0 "Reorganise the Departments"
NATFRA_Reorganize_the_Departments_desc:0 "The Commune had abolished the departments, the base administrative division of France. Designed to destroy feudal and cultural boundaries in 1789, they were decried as bourgeois, a remnant of the tyranny of so-called Reason. This abolition fostered regionalist sentiment: they will be restored, for a better, more efficient administration of France One and Indivisible, without caving to petty localisms."
NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism:0 "Fight Regionalism"
NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism_desc:0 "The federal nature of the Commune has emboldened regionalists, and some are openly asking for autonomy for their regions, particularly in Brittany and even in Corsica. Every inch given to these groups is one closer to separatism. Thankfully France has moved past such remnants of the past, she is One and Indivisible!"
NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations:0 "Normalize Church Relations"
NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations_desc:0 "Relations between the Catholic Church and the Republic have been tense, to say the least, and since 1905 separation of Church and State official diplomatic relations had broken down. However, the Weltkrieg and our common opposition to the Commune has brought us closer, and we must now seek appeased relations with the Holy See."
NATFRA_Combat_Polarization:0 "Combat Polarization"
NATFRA_Combat_Polarization_desc:0 "Crypto-Communards to the left, reactionaries to the right, here we are in the centre and we must stick together to prevent either kind of despotism from toppling the Republic once again. Politics must not be allowed to fall back into violent rhetoric and irreconcilable oppositions: the name of the game is compromise and unity against radicals."

NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness:0 "Privatisation Frenzy"
NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness_desc:0 "So much was seized and collectivised by the Commune that there is no way that a functional economy could be rebuilt if we just accepted the status quo: mass privatisation must continue to help France recreate a market economy."
NATFRA_Create_New_Elite:0 "Create a New Patronal Elite"
NATFRA_Create_New_Elite_desc:0 "Much of the old industrial elites had compromised themselves by throwing themselves at the feet of the military junta, and some whispers that they had plans of outright taking over the state apparatus. Frankly, they can’t be trusted. Through the strategic use of government contracts and investments, we will make sure that the right kind of Republican patriots succeeds in the future."
NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie:0 "Expand the Gendarmerie"
NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie_desc:0 "The Gendarmerie must be expanded and reinforced to enforce order on the rural areas of France, still occasionally plagued by Communard remnants and where the devastation of the war and decollectivisation has left many in difficult situations, with some turning to crime and the Black Market."
NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists:0 "Discredit Republican-Socialists"
NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists_desc:0 "The left-wing of the Radicals, who had thrown their lot in with the Revolution, before being marginalised by more radical socialist elements, are attempting to come crawling back to the Republic: we mustn't let traitors and crypto-Syndicalists infiltrate the halls of power."

NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers:0 "Reinforce Presidential Powers"
NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers_desc:0 "The Third Republic was notoriously unstable: we cannot make the same mistakes as our predecessors, some sort of check on parliamentary power is needed. The president of the Republic must play a unifying role instead of being confined to a purely ceremonial power."
NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare:0 "Catholic Social Welfare"
NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare_desc:0 "According to the social teachings of the Church, Christian solidarity requires that the state protects the dignity and well-being of our fellow man. As such, extensive welfare reform must take place, and private charity efforts will be strongly encouraged and subsidised."
NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists:0 "Integrate Christian Regionalists"
NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists_desc:0 "The Church demands subsidiarity, that is to say, that political decisions should be taken at the local level whenever possible, and the centralising urge of the Republic is rather Jacobin in nature. It is only just to welcome those who desire to protect their local traditions, particularly their attachment to the Faith. France is One, but denying her local particularities is foolish."
NATFRA_Christian_Unions:0 "Christian Unions"
NATFRA_Christian_Unions_desc:0 "Pope Leo XII outlined in the encyclical Rerum Novarum the mutual duties and rights of capital and labour: among these is the right to unionise, and since then faithful Catholics workers have come together to defend their rights in faith-minded unions. These must be heavily promoted, to counterbalance any kind of remnant of socialist rhetoric among the working class."

NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures:0 "Establish Regional Prefectures"
NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures_desc:0 "The prefects and sub-prefects are the direct representatives of the state at the local level, with many responsibilities such as law enforcement. They are meant to be neutral checks on elected local authorities, freely nominated by the government. To prevent any future risk of instability, their powers will be extended and their total loyalty to the Republic ensured."
NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes:0 "Restore Churches and Parishes"
NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes_desc:0 "Though the Commune was not an explicitly atheistic state, it was certainly ferociously anticlerical, and many of our churches have suffered from lack of resources, if not from hostile acts, and war. We will embark on a large-scale restoration effort, providing work and an opportunity to expiate the errors of the past for many."
NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws:0 "Blasphemy Laws"
NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws_desc:0 "With a new Concordat in place, blasphemy laws will follow. Freedom of speech is, of course, an undeniable right, but freedom ends where the rights of others start: an offence against the religion of the majority of Frenchmen cannot be tolerated, especially as freedom of religion was so often abused by Communards acting under the mask of secularism."
NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat:0 "Sign a New Concordat"
NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat_desc:0 "The 1905 Laws of Separation of Churches and State were a tragedy engineered by radicals: denying the Catholic nature of France is simply a denial of reality and a deep injustice. A new Concordat will be agreed to with the Holy See, and France once again will proudly deserve her title of Eldest Daughter of the Church, a first step to restoring the place of the Faith in our nation."

NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree:0 "Rule by Decree"
NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree_desc:0 "To counter the revolutionary threat, an efficient government is needed. The new military junta under Colonel de La Rocque will not bother itself with the pageantry of parliamentary democracy: until order and stability are assured, decisions will be taken and applied by the Colonel, on the advice of patriotic experts in their fields."
NATFRA_Privatizations_For_Loyalty:0 "Privatizations For Loyalty"
NATFRA_Privatizations_For_Loyalty_desc:0 "To rebuild a functional market economy, privatisation is needed. But to ensure that the best men reap the profits of the renewed greatness of the French nation, it is patriots, loyal to France and the Colonel, that will be prioritised in the sale of formerly public assets."
NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists:0 "Hunt Down Crypto-Syndicalists"
NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists_desc:0 "Thorough purges of syndicalist elements have already taken place, but among newly professed loyalists the Republic hides many crypto-socialists, waiting for the right opportunity to strike again. Radical-socialists, “reformist” unionists, pardoned officers, they will all be investigated and interrogated. Socialism will not be allowed to attack the French nation again."
NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role:0 "The Social Role of the Engineer"
NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role_desc:0 "The engineer is both a skilled technician and worker, and as such is the perfect link between the popular classes and capital. Engineers must add to their professional and technical skills a deep understanding of our institutions promoting class cooperation so that peace in the workplace can be guaranteed by patriots conscious of the importance of their duty to France."
NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies:0 "Expand Corporatist Policies"
NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies_desc:0 "France fell because of class conflict because neither capital nor workers respected their mutual duties to each other because they focused on ultimately petty issues of profit instead of their much greater mission: their duty towards their patrie. The government will ensure that these errors will not be repeated, and that class tensions are subjugated by Catholic brotherhood and love for France."
NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System:0 "Patriotic Technical School System"
NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System_desc:0 "The youths of France are distraught, lost in a new world: a system of patriotic technical schools will be created, for them to learn the practical skills that will be demanded of them in the workforce, as well as through apprenticeship and hands-on experience. From the lost children of the syndicalist cause, we will create a generation of workers proudly helping to rebuild the motherland."

NATFRA_A_Social_Republic:0 "A Social Republic"
NATFRA_A_Social_Republic_desc:0 "The Republic must be a loving, caring mother to her children and ensure to them all safety, well-being, healthcare, access to education, and a right to work. The syndicalist revolution was brought on by the terrible conditions of the working masses, leading France down towards a dark path out of desperation: the reborn Republic will not make the mistakes that tore her apart again."
NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic:0 "A Liberal Republic"
NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic_desc:0 "The Republic must be an impartial mother to her children, offering them all manners of freedom and liberty regardless of personal circumstances. Against all odds, the liberal ideals of the Third Republic have been kept alive despite anarchy and tyranny: the Republic reborn brandishes the torch of Liberty and once again shines bright, a true example to all lovers of Reason."
NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic:0 "A Catholic Republic"
NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic_desc:0 "In 1892, Pope Leo XIII had called on French Catholics to accept the Republic, to take France back from anti-Catholic forces. Despite unceasing persecution from liberals to socialists, the faithful have worked tirelessly, and half a century later, it has been done. Through our efforts, the French Republic has finally been baptised and never again will anyone question the piety of the Eldest Daughter."
NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic:0 "A Strong Republic"
NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic_desc:0 "The Third Republic fell because of its chaotic nature. This error led to defeat and exile: our reborn Republic will not allow the foolishness of the past to be repeated. Thanks to the leadership of the Colonel, under whom we are all united, France will rise again, her children united in a common purpose, the restoration of her glory.\nUnité!"

NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic:0 "Proclaim the Fourth Republic"
NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic_desc:0 "To refound the Republic on stronger foundations, leaving the past truly behind, a new constitution has been drafted. It will enshrine our recent reforms and lead the Republic towards a renewed age of prosperity and prestige.\n\nLiberté! Egalité! Fraternité! Vive la France!"
NATFRA_Social_D_abord:0 "Social d'Abord"
NATFRA_Social_D_abord_desc:0 "Colonel de La Rocque has led France through her darkest hour and will lead for the foreseeable future, to profoundly reforge the Republic and ensure that the tragedy that has torn apart our nation for the last decades never occurs again. Our people finally reunited will not let itself be divided again by the enemies of France.\nVive le Colonel! Vive la France!"

# Intro and starting politics

nfa.1.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - History"
nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic fell in the same way it came to be: in defeat by German arms and facing socialist unrest. As the civil war that followed the Communard revolution of 1920 eventually came to a close, the government chose exile instead of surrender. Having retreated to Marseilles, they embarked with the French navy towards Algiers, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the Boches. Neither happened and instead, a peace treaty was concluded between the German Empire and the Commune, with little to no regard towards the exiled government. The Commune was recognised as the successor of the French Republic by most of the newly German-aligned world, while the exiles remained seen as the legitimate government by those who had fought beside them in the Weltkrieg. But the refugees refused to be cowed: they renewed their claim as the legitimate government of all of France and her empire and their commitment to the Entente, preparing for any opportunity to strike.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the exile proved highly unstable. The democratic forces proved unable to form a lasting government, instead of descending ever further into petty squabbles, a situation made worse by tensions between exiles and pieds-noirs colonists, and in 1926 the army stepped in, declared a state of emergency, and formed a thinly-veiled junta under the Lion of Verdun, Philippe Pétain, supported by many heroes of the Weltkrieg, such as his protégé Admiral François Darlan or General Henri Mordacq. As supreme commander of the French military which holds a tight grip on the state, Pétain has total control over France, but the constitution has neither been amended nor annulled and as such the Republic and its institutions continue to exist on paper, though the parliament does little more than rubber-stamp decisions made by the Marshal and his cadres. Political parties still exist and continue to operate to give to the population the illusion of democracy, though few are idealistic enough to believe they have any real power. The four main political parties are the Radical Party (RAD), the Democratic-Republican Party (PRD), an alliance born in exile of various traditional liberal-conservative parties, the French Social Party (PSF), and the French Action (AF)."
nfa.1.a:0 "Those Accursed Communards!"

nfa.2.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - Political Situation"
nfa.2.d:0 "Marshal Pétain is convinced that authoritarian rule is needed for the salvation of France. But though the prestige of the Radicals and the PRD is low, as they are seen as holding a share of responsibility in the defeat and the revolution as the main parties of the Third Republic, they still enjoy some popular support while the PSF created after the war by veterans is seen by many as striking the needed middle way between democracy and a strong rule: as such banning the parties would create more instability at a time when the Republic cannot afford it. On the other hand, none of the democratic parties are strong enough to impose anything on the Marshal, still widely popular among veterans who see him as the Lion of Verdun, while the armed forces see him as the only one able to properly prepare France for the fight against the Internationale. But the regime’s balancing act cannot last forever: the more democratically minded are beginning to lose confidence in the regime, while the royalists of the Action Française believe the salvation of France will only come through a toppling of the Republic and its institutions, an idea many within the army and among traditional French and native elites are worryingly receptive to. To put it simply, the junta is slowly but surely losing political credibility and is now mainly held together by the prestige of Pétain."
nfa.2.a:0 "We can trust the Lion!"

nfa.3.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - Growing Concerns"
nfa.3.d:0 "As if this lack of civilian support wasn’t enough, trust in the Marshal is starting to erode within the army, the backbone of the regime. Pétain’s favouritism towards his protégés has put many in key positions, and though they certainly are competent, many officers are left behind while others worry that this could encourage doctrinal rot, that Pétain is surrounding himself with yesmen. Some within the Marshal’s entourage have however been openly critical of this state of affairs, such as Henri Mordacq, and for now, this discontentment within the army is limited to debate, as many hope that Pétain will eventually listen to his more reform-minded protégés. One thing is clear, however, an escalation of these divisions would prove disastrous for the regime.\n\nThe most important problem facing the nation, however, is simply its situation, in exile. Though in Algeria, officially annexed as part of France as an overseas department in the late 19th century, exiles and pieds-noirs settlers make up a significant part of the population, in some major cities even making up a majority, overall Europeans are still a small minority ruling over millions of indigènes, who despite being considered Frenchmen are essentially second-class citizens, subject to heavy taxes and forced labour, with rule from Algiers enforced by native elites and the army. Since the defeat in the Weltkrieg, the colonial situation is precarious: unrest is ruthlessly put down, recent famines were badly managed, syndicalist and pan-Arab agents spread propaganda against colonial authorities. However, most traditional indigenous elites are still loyal to France, and there exists a growing class of French-educated natives and native war veterans who despite wanting reform remain loyal. But one thing is clear: if the government is careless, further unrest and perhaps even revolts are bound to happen.\n\n§RBe careful! A failure to keep the resistance in non-core African states under 80 will result in revolts.§!"
nfa.3.a:0 "I’m sure it’s going to be fine!"

nfa.4.t:0 "Death of a Friend"
nfa.4.d:0 "His Majesty George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India, friend of France, our great ally during the Great War and since our exile, as well as a personal friend of Marshal Pétain since the two met on the battlefields two decades ago has died today at 70 years old. Though the situation is unfortunately tense at home, given the magnitude of the event it is important for the Entente that the Lion attends the funeral of George V and the coronation of his son Edward, and more personally for Pétain it is important to mourn a friend and ally, who like him oversaw the exile of his people after bloody revolutions in their homelands, and like him was wholeheartedly dedicated to one day come back and retake what is rightfully theirs. And so Marshal Pétain embarked on a special Trans-Atlantic flight, ready to honour the memory of a friend but celebrate a new era of Anglo-French friendship."
nfa.4.a:0 "The King is dead, long live the King!"

nfa.5.t:0 "The Lion in Canada"
nfa.5.d:0 "After a sixty-hour transatlantic flight, Marshal Pétain arrived in Ottawa, greeted by Prime Minister Mackenzie King and a large crowd of Canadians, mostly Québécois who see this state visit as a renewal of Anglo-French cooperation. They then drove to Windsor, where late King-Emperor George had asked to be buried. After a grandiose and emotional ceremony where Pétain was finally able to say farewell to a personal friend and ally, he took a tour of Ontario and Québec, greeted all along the way as a friend of the Empire, before meeting with King Edward VIII. In a pre-planned move, the two men shook hands in front of the media of the world, and the new king declared that no matter the struggles the future holds, the French and British nations would always fight side by side in this great crusade against the syndicalist threat. Later on, the two men held a private talk, discussing current issues facing the Entente, the policies that both men were planning on undertaking, as well as the inevitable prospect of war. The mutual undying commitment of both nations to each other was, of course, renewed, announcing even stronger bonds within the Entente."

nfa.6.t:0 "Disagreements within the Armée"
nfa.6.d:0 "After the Grande Guerre, two schools of thoughts have emerged among the younger superior officers to explain the military defeat. If both conclude that the defeat was primarily caused by inefficiency, personal feuds and a general lack of coordination within the military high command, wasting the bravery and blood of the French infantryman as well as the strategic and tactical innovations of Phillipe Pétain, they disagree on what caused those issues and most importantly on what should be done to correct them. Two men have emerged as the leaders of these factions within the French army, and both are planning to release books explaining their point of view. They have sent copies to the Marshal in hopes of getting some public support for their work over the opposition."
nfa.6.a:0 "Let's see what they wrote"

nfa.7.t:0 "The Bear or the Rooster?"
nfa.7.d:0 "Henri Mordacq, nicknamed “the Bear”, an infantry general who shot up the ranks during the Great War through sheer bravery and commanding ability, particularly in the desperate defence of Arras. Close to Pétain but a long time critic of the military establishment, he believes the war was lost due to the lack of experienced officers and an out of touch high command. He plans to release a book titled “Lessons of 1914 and the Next War”, detailing his experience of the war and his proposals for the coming war. Among those proposals, the retirement of all officers older than fifty-six years old and a merging of all branches of the armed forces could prove controversial, effectively reorganizing the Forces Armées from scratch.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, nicknamed “the Rooster”, recently promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. A fellow veteran of the Great War, he bravely led his men at the battle of Verdun before being wounded and captured. Escaping captivity, he became a symbol of resilience against German aggression. Particularly ambitious, he became a protégé of the Lion of Verdun and a renowned military theorist, making rather similar observations regarding the defeat as Mordacq but advocating for greater cooperation rather than reorganisation, a greater use of armour with air support, greater autonomy for officers, and creating alongside the traditional conscripted army a more important core of professional soldiers. These proposals have found a lot of support among officers, but de Gaulle is planning to release another essay, simply entitled “The Discord”. If this essay is simply presented as a collection of observations on the confusion reigning among officers during the War, to some it seem to endorse the stab-in-the-back theory popular among civilians, soldiers, and officers alike. Especially considering de Gaulle’s proposal to prevent confusion at critical times is submission of the military to “moral” civilian power.\n\nMarshal Pétain could choose to support the publication of either of those books, effectively setting the course of reforms within the armed forces, or simply let the debate run its course."
nfa.7.a:0 "Support the Bear, while we disagree on some issues, something radical has to be done."
nfa.7.b:0 "Support the Rooster, reform is needed but the real issue lies outside of the armed forces."
nfa.7.c:0 "The Lion does not need to take sides! Debate is healthy, support neither."

nfa_bonapartist_tactics:0 "We are following Bonapartist Tactics"

nfa.8.t:0 "Les Leçons de 1914 et la Prochaine Guerre"
nfa.8.d:0 "Supported by Marshal Pétain, “Lessons of 1914 and the Next War” by General Henri Mordacq has become an instant best-seller among officers and the general public alike. After all, most are veterans. While upper ranking officers grumble about Mordacq’s proposal of a sweeping reorganization of the armed forces, all can see the acuteness of his analysis and enjoy the scathing denunciations of both Kaiser and Communards. The Bear's calls to action, to reform, to be able to stand ready to strike against the Red at the first opportunity, echo throughout the République. Many are starting to consider Mordacq a potential political leader, and his calls for reorganisation are being assimilated with a more general discontentment with the political structures of the nation."
nfa.8.a:0 "Could the Bear’s call really bring change?"

nfa.9.t:0 "La Discorde"
nfa.9.d:0 "Supported by Marshal Pétain and highly anticipated, “The Discord” by lieutenant-colonel Charles de Gaulle has immediately become a best-seller, praised by critics for its thought-provoking telling of the confusion reigning among officers during the Weltkrieg. While it is nothing new to those that lived through it, many in the general public, particularly the younger generation, too young to have fought in the Grande Guerre, discover dumbfounded this uncomfortable truth: the defeat was by our own doing more than anything else. While the tactical and strategic reforms proposed in this essay by de Gaulle have been acclaimed by officers, it is the larger societal reform some see the Rooster hint at in his work that struck a chord for many in the armed forces, from the simple infantryman to the Lion of Verdun himself, and among civilians, particularly veterans: all those sacrifices, so much bloodshed, so many lives lost, how could they have not been enough to beat back the Boches? The issue must lie primarily elsewhere, in the government, too weak to impose its will upon the armed forces and far too willing to let them fall into fatal discord. Perhaps a stronger, more moral civilian power is needed.\n\nIn any case, de Gaulle, already a celebrated war hero and influential officer, is quickly becoming an even more popular figure, as many of those touched by his call to reform feel he is the perfect example a new generation of officers must aspire to be like, while some see in him the perfect man to help carry out those larger reforms, though the lieutenant-colonel himself is quick to defer any praise towards his “mentor”, Philippe Pétain."
nfa.9.a:0 "Un ordre moral ? Sounds familiar."

nfa.10.t:0 "Run on the Bookshops"
nfa.10.d:0 "Marshal Pétain having chosen to let this debate among officers run its course, both Mordacq and de Gaulle’s books were published on the same day. Both highly anticipated, “The Discord” and “Lessons of 1914 and the Next War” have instantly become best-sellers, most bookshops running out of stock quickly and publishers barely being able to keep up with demand. While both essays have been highly praised by critics and the general public alike, their simultaneous publication has prompted comparisons between the two works and become the number one topic of discussion in cafés, family dinners and officer lounges alike. Debates sometimes get heated as they drift from literary to political questions, as people wonder aloud about the implications of the proposed reforms of the two officers, some are starting to see both the Bear and the Rooster as potential political leaders."
nfa.10.a:0 "Surtout, n’en parlons pas!"

nfa.11.t:0 "Ils en ont parlé..."
nfa.11.d:0 "While the debates gripping the nation after the simultaneous publications of Charles de Gaulle and Henri Mordacq’s essays had thus far stayed relatively civil, they seem to be spiralling out of control. Last evening, an informal talk about the topic among veterans in an Algiers café turned first into a fight, then a brawl, and, finally, as police were called in to calm the situation, into a small riot. While only injuries and property damages have been reported, evidently this literary debate has crystallized much deeper issues in our nation and media, officers, and regular citizens alike feel compelled to choose a side. Marshal Pétain has privately asked the Bear and the Rooster to make a joint statement calling for peaceful debate, as both men grow ever more influential."
nfa.11.a:0 "A passionate people we certainly are, but this is going too far!"

nfa.12.t:0 "La Discorde"
nfa.12.d:0 "Despite a lack of support from his patron Marshal Pétain, Charles de Gaulle had his latest book, “The Discord”, published. The Rooster’s colourful descriptions of the confusion reigning among officers during the Weltkrieg has seen moderate success and received praise by critics, primarily the newspaper Action Française, as an eminently insightful dive into the issues plaguing the armed forces. However, de Gaulle’s calls to reforms, though certainly not falling on deaf ears especially among the higher-ranking officers, are overshadowed by the ever-growing popularity of Mordacq’s ideas."
nfa.12.a:0 "A good read, but not much else."

nfa.13.t:0 "The Other Marshal Retires"
nfa.13.d:0 "A career soldier and war hero Marshal Franchet d'Espèrey announced his retirement today. He was the only other Marshal in the French military besides Pétain himself after the death of Joseph Joffre, and served as Pétain’s right-hand man as vice-president of the military council, in charge of military affairs when Marshal Pétain was too preoccupied with more stately business. Now that he is gone, the Marshal will have to choose who will serve as his replacement. His two protégés, both war heroes and up and coming officers, Charles de Gaulle or Henri Mordacq, are expected to be chosen to ascend to these highest of responsibilities. Such a promotion will be seen by many as appointing a successor for the Lion of Verdun, now an old man. Should Mordacq be appointed, it is likely that he would be seen as Pétain’s successor, and the move would be perceived as a clear endorsement of Mordacq’s plans for sweeping military and political reform. Picking de Gaulle, a much younger man, closer to Pétain and a known sympathiser of the Marshal’s unabashed distrust of parliamentarianism, would certainly be perceived as a way to hold on to power for some more time while better preparing his eventual heir to succeed him.\n\nAlternatively, Pétain could simply not appoint a successor to Franchet d’Espèrey, guaranteeing that the hero of Verdun would once again take an active interest in military matters, and centralise power around himself.\n\n There is also another option, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte has been steadily gaining favor with both Petain and the High command, and many think that his military experience combined with family heritage could help bring France back home. "
nfa.13.a:0 "Only the Bear is fit to lead the armies of France"
nfa.13.b:0 "The Lion does not need to divide his prerogative"
nfa.13.c:0 "We need an officer of the Young Guard, bring in de Gaulle!"
nfa.13.e:0 "Louis-Napoléon has blood on his side!"

nfa.14.t:0 "Les Leçons de 1914 et la Prochaine Guerre"
nfa.14.d:0 "Henri Mordacq had his “Lessons of 1914 and the Next War” privately published, finding moderate success and critical praise for its acute analysis of the defeat, though the sweeping reorganizations proposed by the Bear have proven controversial, among highers officers for being too radical and among the general public for on the contrary not doing enough to tackle the real problem exposed by de Gaulle’s essay. However, those less enthusiastic about The Discord, particularly those anxious of what a more “moral” civilian order might entail, have found in Mordacq an alternative and see in the general a potential political leader, someone to go against the grain of the stab-in-the-back fever currently sweeping through the nation."
nfa.14.a:0 "An interesting read, shame the Bear fails to see the real issue"

nfa.16.t:0 "Maréchal, Merci!"
nfa.16.d:0 "Early this morning, Marshal Philippe Pétain signed a short, laconic statement announcing his immediate resignation as head of state of the French Republic. Though this retirement has been carefully prepared by the Lion, and no one in either the government or the administration is surprised by this decision, for the people this is the sudden end of an era. Though some are openly rejoicing, most are simply stunned: after all the younger among them have never known a different political situation and for those old enough to remember the mainland the Marshal has been the centre of political life for more than a decade. To prevent any kind of panic and alleviate fears for the future, the hero of Verdun then decided to give a speech in front of the assembled Senate and National Assembly, broadcast on the radio: citing his old age as the primary reason for his retirement, the surprisingly cheerful Pétain then proceeded to thank all those that supported him in the troubled times since the Grande Guerre, in particular veterans, making less than subtle references to the Bear of Arras, Henri Mordacq, though never naming him.\n\nHis closing statement calling for a peaceful transition of power and reaffirming his full trust in the people to continue the fight to retake the métropole, Marshal Pétain ended his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from his iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, immediately followed by thunderous applause and a long-standing ovation. As the applause died down, a voice resonated: “Maréchal, merci !”, “Marshal, thank you!”, a breach of protocol that all in the room immediately happily imitated. Outside the building, the population had spontaneously come together to say goodbye to the saviour of France, regardless of class and status, exiled, pied-noirs and Algerians, and all repeated this cry, thanking Philippe Pétain as he was leaving on foot, as all the frustrations, all the anger of the past few weeks and years at least momentarily disappeared."
nfa.16.a:0 "Maréchal, au revoir!"

This special congress already assembled, no name was proposed other than that of general Jean Jules Henri Mordacq. Elected almost unanimously, General Mordacq immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio thanking Marshal Pétain for his service, reaffirming his commitment to immediate reform and the mobilisation of the nation to retake the mainland from the Communards. Though some are still anxious that this transition of power is too sudden and others would have preferred it didn’t happen at all, the people already assembled in Algiers to say goodbye to the Marshal and all those all over the republic glued to their radio posts broke out in spontaneous celebrations that lasted long into the night. This morning, only one thing is certain: this is surely the dawn of a new era."

nfa.19.t:0 "Le Lion et L’Ours" #Fight for Influence

As such, as Marshal Pétain seeks increased support from diverse powerful groups in his struggle with Mordacq’s partisans, he has found particular luck with the industrial upper classes, both grateful for the support that gave them the opportunity to strive after exile and deeply ideologically committed to the regime, believing a strong hand is needed to guide France towards salvation. However, to prevent these elites from being tempted by the more democratic forces within the République, many of Pétain’s advisors are suggesting a campaign of increased support and strategic investments: not only would this develop the nation’s economy and war capabilities even further, but by choosing carefully those who would benefit from these investments, for example both loyal supporters of the regime and those still tempted by Mordacq's rhetoric, the Lion’s grip on power could be restored, maybe even increased."

As such, the president’s advisors have put together a plan to silence rumours of any wrongdoing: a large scale anti-corruption drive, at all levels of society. By making corruption an even more serious offense, encouraging denunciation of even the slightest hint of it and more generally enforcing a renewed moral order within the administration and public services, the government hopes that the public will turn a blind eye to Pétain’s recent promises of support and investment to various groups, individuals and industries.\n\nHowever, a fair amount of resources will be needed to fuel this drive, and though this plan could help Philippe Pétain maintain power some in the government argue that these resources could be better used to try to find even more support for the regime, while others argue that these measures could alienate parts of the administration."

The Marshal, either unwilling or unable to take any radical action to protect his regime had stayed oddly silent, holed up in the presidential Summer Palace in the heights of Algiers as unrest flared up all around him, his support among both the people and the elites he had tried so hard to rally quickly withering. All could see the writing on the wall, his rule could not last much longer, there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to sell out the country to hold on to power, was left.\n\nToday, what all were expecting finally happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of protests instead seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarters of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. In a short radio speech, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relating to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offense, ending his speech with a long list of the shady dealings revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with tense applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial."

Coincidentally present in the building, General Mordacq immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, promising new elections in the near future and eventually a new constitution. Despite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters hope for radical reform and a more democratic future.

Passion for truth, passion for justice, and passion for our country. I therefore ask the public to remember that, while we are prosecuting a defendant today, History will judge the judges themselves one day.”\n\nWith these words, the president of the High Court opened the first hearing of a long trial to prosecute Pétain, accused of corruption, treason and conspiracy against the République. Determined to defend his honour, Marshal Pétain prepared both his defense and his memoirs from his cell in the Casbah of Algiers, only allowed visits by his wife and his lawyer. Appearing in court in full uniform, after a short statement on the first day of his trial asserting that all of his actions as president had been taken in the interest of the salvation of France and that he was only responsible in front of the French people and not the High Court, the former president stayed silent as witnesses after witnesses corroborated the accusations lobbied against him. After weeks of passionate debate, the sentence has finally been given: death. At this verdict, the Marshal who had stayed so stoic briefly showed weakness, lost his composure, briefly the Lion of Verdun turned into Philippe Pétain, a tired old man of more than 80 years of age.\n\nPublic opinion is incredibly divided, but it seems that if most wanted the Marshal gone from power, the majority thinks any sentence would be going too far, let alone the death penalty. Wanting to avoid making this trial too overtly partisan, Henri Mordacq has thus far stayed silent, however as president it his within his power to commute Pétain’s sentence. What should the Bear do?"

Nevertheless, their support and expertise has proved invaluable for the regime and Pétain has met repeatedly with representatives from the organization, taking some of its members as special advisors to help him navigate the crisis currently unfolding and the ideas of the Redressement Français will no doubt have a tremendous amount of influence in the decisions taken by the Marshal going forward."

Marshal Pétain’s gamble to hold on power has paid off: with the Redressement Français’ precious help, he has managed to thoroughly secure the support of the upper classes, rekindle the admiration of the people, and calm down social unrest. The democratic camp still exists, but it has been severely weakened by media attacks and backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans, its support base greatly eroded by the government’s promises of reform. It’s rumoured that Mordacq himself has struck a deal with the government. Many thought this would be the end of his regime, and yet Philippe Pétain emerges from this crisis stronger than ever: The Bear’s faction is no longer a threat, and the people once again has put its trust in the Lion of Verdun. While the Marshal has had a strong grip on politics since the revolution, it seems that now nothing can stop him from truly reforming the republic according to his wishes.\n\nOr, some whisper, according to the Redressement Français’ wishes. Its help proved decisive: on an ideological level, as many of the reforms proposed by Pétain are lifted straight from their ideas, and on the material level, the Renewal having turned itself into the propaganda arm of the government during the crisis, funding and organising its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime’s stabilisation came in large part thanks to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think tank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and, more importantly, with Pétain’s trust and gratitude. They will no doubt have a large influence shaping the future of the République, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group’s writings. In any case, now that the crisis is over the entire nation’s attention is turned towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment.

Everything had been carefully studied, the plans of the building had been analysed to ensure that the General could leave him alive, but he knew that there was no such thing as zero risk. He took a picture of himself with his wife and children out of his pocket, and put it back in his pocket a few seconds later, praying that the driver would not have seen anything.\nOnce he arrived in front of the HQ, Lelong got out of the vehicle, head held high, well aware that he could no longer reverse...\n\nArriving late in front of the building, he apologized to the officers who were guarding him, then went to join the meeting. After greetings and a series of apologies and explanations for his delay, he went to sit down and listened to the various proposals, having taken care to settle as close as possible to Pétain. The discussions and debates followed, then he pretended the need to go to the bathroom to get up and leave the room, leaving his briefcase behind him. Weygand intercepted him before he came out and asked him what he had brought with him."Confidential documents that were successfully stolen from Mordacq, we even found a plan to assassinate Pétain.

He's not dead!  Call a doctor," and immediately recognized Charles De Gaulle's voice. As adrenaline flowed through his body, he ran to the meeting room, picking up a fallen soldier's rifle as he passed by one of the doors that had previously been guarded before the explosion. The door fell with a simple touch, and Lelong saw Pétain covered with blood but with wide open eyes and at his side de Gaulle. Panicked and determined to complete the mission, Lelong fired two bullets into the Marshal's chest, and a third went to lodge in the General's head beside him. Both collapsed to the ground, covered in blood. Lelong then threw his weapon away, and ran back to the toilet before speeding out through the window overlooking the back of the building. He then reached the door at the back, which was no longer guarded because the soldiers had been called inside.

Immediately transferred to a secret location near Algiers, news of his arrest was triumphantly spread by the government to the media, feeding them a colorful story of the fool Mordacq conspiring with Communards agents to take down the Pétain government and invite the Reds in. While it’s undeniable that some supporters of Mordacq had ties to the more left wing pre-war parties and some of those arrested have confessed under strong interrogation techniques to being on the Commune’s payroll, the evidence of such collusion is light at best. Despite being offered a generous deal in exchange of his confession, Mordacq himself so far refuses to admit doing anything wrong. Surprisingly, many are openly doubting the official story. Arresting such a popular war hero is not going well even among strong supporters of the regime, particularly veterans who remember very well the heroic defense of Arras, and even within the army many who would have been at worst apathetic with repressing the democratic movement are now outraged that the government would go so far.\n\nIn any case, what Pétain feared happened: Henri Mordacq is now a martyr. Open contestation from the army is unprecedented, and many within the government are starting to panic and advise a balanced approach: doubling down on the repression, going after those now protesting against Mordacq’s arrest, while at the same time pulling back somewhat, transfer Mordacq out of hiding, and give him a public trial."

Wanting to stay discreet, the escort had been kept to a minimum and was swiftly dealt with, those attempting to resist shot dead, Mordacq escorted to a car and the convoy set on fire all in the span of less than five minutes. Survivors of the attack describe the prisoner as being just as surprised as his escort that this was happening, but clearly someone coordinated this attack from the inside: not only was this transfer supposed to be a secret to even most of the government, but a fake itinerary had been disseminated by intelligence agents and a decoy convoy had been organised. Whoever leaked the information must have been either very well connected, or is very high up in the chain of command. An investigation has of course been launched and all police are on high alert, but while the violence of Mordacq’s partisans has earned the regime some sympathy, this spectacular evasion has thrown the government in total panic: not only this shows to the eyes of the world that the regime is losing control, but it shows our people that the democratic movement has very influential friends. In any case, the few advisers still advocating for moderation when dealing with the democratic camp have been thoroughly disgraced with some even under heavy suspicion of being Mordacq sympathizers and those advocating for harsher repression now have the Marshal’s ear."

When political pressure and intimidation do not work, blackmail and social shaming generally did the trick. However, this treatment was reserved for civilians, as the government and intelligence services were careful to preserve the reputation of the armed forces, dissenters generally being simply sent on assignment in the middle of the Sahara where their concerns wouldn’t bother anyone. However, with Mordacq’s arrest shocking many, it’s been decided that the large amount of information collected over the years by the intelligence services on soldiers and officers alike would be put to good use. The latest victim of such attempted blackmail is admiral Lucien Lacaze, a known supporter of Mordacq and well liked, successful, and above all morally irreproachable officer. The man has refused to back down when approached by our agents, and denies any of the accusations lobbied against him.\n\nAs such, these shocking revelations will appear in an afternoon special edition in all newspapers. In fact, mysteriously, all those who have publicly stated their support for Mordacq seem to have been cursed to have their most private secrets revealed, which could of course severely hinder their careers and might just spurn them to resign in disgrace."

Admiral Lacaze has been made into a new martyr for the democratic camp, and though he retired in the wake of the scandal, it seems he is now in direct contact with Mordacq's partisans. Although this drastically hinders our plans to deal with dissent among the armed forces with some subtlety, there are far more worrying things: not only we have lost whatever trust officers still put in the regime, but the leaflets currently spreading like wildfire contain confidential documents concerning the fabrication of the various scandals, implicating in this defamation campaign high ranking officers as well many within the administration and in the government. There is only one possible conclusion: there is a mole among us and we need to catch her to prevent more leaks."

But it seems that following the Lacaze Affair and the subsequent revelations leaked to soldiers, officers, and eventually the general public, many outraged officers have ignored this principle, and suddenly decided to walk down the streets to protest. While our forces were supposed to suppress any protest, many police and military officers are confused by this unusual situation and decided to simply stand aside to avoid fighting their comrades and friends. Many civilians are watching this protest out of curiosity, and it is now obvious for everyone that Pétain’s rule is far from being popular even within the armed forces, traditionally the one place where the regime was most secure. Since protests are banned for active duty soldiers, the official version of events is that those officers are simply “parading”, a term that most opposition journals, underground or miraculously still being openly published, are now using ironically to designate these protests. The “Parades” have been going on for days now, and it is time we choose how to deal with the situation. In the meantime; the 2nd Bureau is still investigating to find the mole that created this ridiculous situation in the first place."

While the protests had so far been mostly about protesting the regime’s policies, they have now taken a radical turn and openly call for the Marshal to step down, believing him unfit to rule even a second more, though many still hesitate to put the blame on him personally as some consider him senile and under control from his close advisors. In any case, the number of protesters is increasing each day, and our forces still refuse to take any active action against them, at best barring access to the way to the presidential palace and other important government buildings, with discrete but numerous gestures of solidarity between the two. The most radical forces within the regime believe it would be better to act immediately and that it might already be too late to stop Mordacq, still on the run."

The Marshal and his advisers, despite taking so many radical actions in the last few months now either unwilling or unable to do so to protect the regime had stayed oddly silent, holed up in the presidential Summer Place in the heights of Algiers as unrest flared up all around him, his support among both the people and the military that had stayed so loyal until not so long ago withering a bit more every day. All were expecting the Marshal to strike, many were ready to die in the streets, and yet, Pétain did nothing. If this was done hoping the people would calm down, it was foolish as there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to brutalise his people to hold on to power was left."

nfa.50.d:0 "Today, what no one had expected happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of parades instead joined the protests led by Mordacq himself and seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarter of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. Even if Pétain had tried to strike, this was in fact doomed from the start: most the 2nd Bureau, the secret services, was compromised and cooperating with the Bear’s partisans, the “leaks” were entirely purposeful. In a short radio speech, the first since his arrest and subsequent escape, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq and freshly freed from jail, rose to deliver an improvised speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his tyrannical regime, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the suspended Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offense, ending his speech with a long list of the numerous grievous crimes revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with thunderous applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still foolishly loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial, held in the same high security cell that had been prepared for Henri Mordacq."

While there is no constitutional provision for the creation of such a committee, there is historical precedent, and the Chamber of Deputies is, after all, the sovereign authority in the Republic and can distribute power as it sees fit. While some deputies abstained, the majority voted in favor of the proposal and no name other than that of General Henri Mordacq, hero of the struggle against the tyrannical Pétain, was proposed to head the committee, an eagerness possibly helped by the presence of soldiers loyal to the Bear guarding all exits of the room. Present in the building, the General immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, new elections once the situation stabilizes and eventually the redaction of a new constitution.\n\nDespite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters are finally able to show themselves after months of repression. Despite Pétain’s best efforts, a new dawn is rising on the French Republic and the Bear’s promised reforms can only strengthen the country for the war that is inevitably coming."

nfa.52.d:0 "As the crisis unfolds, it’s quickly becoming obvious that the regime has lost most of its base of support. Veterans are shocked by the actions of the man they have revered for so long, and La Grande Muette is making herself heard loud and clear: she is outraged by the government’s repression. The government desperately needs allies, and it seems at least one group inpart might be interested in such a partnership: the royalist Action Française. Indeed, today Charles de Gaulle came to discuss privately with Marshal Pétain about a potential alliance of circumstances. The Rooster seems to have taken upon himself to act as link between his mentor and the party he has never hidden sympathies for and though the national integralists have been consistently and brazenly opposed to the République, considering Pétain’s regime as barely a step up from the weak pre-war government, they share a common trait: distrust for parliamentary democracy and the liberal parties whose rule led to the fall of France in the first place.\n\nAs such, the Action Française is suggesting unofficial cooperation with the regime, at least until the crisis is over, a partnership that could prove salutatory for the Lion and his government. As an old, very well established party the French Action has many sympathizers among both the upper and lower classes, within the Church, the army and even enjoys some popularity with the native population, drawn in by promises of decentralisation and respect of local customs. Its daily newspaper is among the most widely read in the nation, and the party controls a network of “newspaper vendors”, the Camelots du Roi, the King's Camelots, a security service made up of youngsters and students that some describe as a paramilitary force, used to street brawls and crowd control. Finally, some of the more radical members of the AF have hinted at being willing to use every tool at their disposal to take more “direct action” against the democratic camp. All of this could be used to serve the regime and finally end the crisis once and for all.\n\nHowever this partnership could alienate the last few loyal partisans of Pétain, and there is no doubt that the services of the AF would come at the cost of compromise with them down the road. But the regime might simply not survive the next few weeks if we don’t take this deal."

Using it’s vast network of influence in the upper classes and the armed forces, the party has managed to soothe some of the dissent coming from there, and the Camelots du Roi now show up every day to push back against the protests and secure key areas, not showing the same hesitation as the regular forces to fight those still parading and not having any care for regulations or avoiding injuries. It would seem like the regime can breathe a great sigh of relief, as Mordacq's movement is now far less ascendant.\n\nHowever, part of the loss of ground for the democratic camp is the due to brutal tactics of the more radical elements of the French Action, who have organised themselves in a highly structured, secretive and independent group to take direct action against the Bear’s supporters, with little to no oversight by the party and none from the government. Intimidation, assassination, and even bombings, in the last few weeks it seems nothing is too far for them to take down the democratic camp. Nicknamed the Organisation des Quatre Cents Coups, the Four Hundreds Blows Organisation or less literally, Organisation to Raise Hell, it’s impossible to deny that they have been incredibly effective in suppressing our opponents but the Lion himself is quietly horrified by the terroristic nature of the group."

Rejected, the AF has now thrown its weight against the government and even the dear protégé of Pétain, de Gaulle, has started disassociating himself from the regime. It seems many in the government are considering fleeing abroad, while it’s rumoured that Mordacq himself has come out of hiding and has been seen at meetings with parliamentarians and army officers.

Nevertheless, their resources, expertise and extensive links to the elites could prove to be salvation for the regime, whatever is left of it. Asking the Marshal to form a new government filled with members of the organisation and essentially a free hand to reform the country according to their ideals, in exchange they promise that they will do everything in their power to end the crisis. While this would be an egregious offer at any other time, Philippe Pétain really has no other choice but to accept."

Marshal Pétain’s gamble to hold on to power had almost failed, but when all seemed lost the Redressement Français’ precious help saved the day. The group managed to first thoroughly secure to support of the upper classes, anxious over the crisis unfolding, and create a media offensive putting all the blame of the recent repressive and abusive decisions of the regime on sycophants taking advantage of the elderly Marshal, many of whom have already been arrested on treason and corruption charges, a lie that many in the nation are more than happy to believe, civilians, veterans, soldiers and officers alike. The democratic camp still very much exists, but through backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans and promises of reform, its support is rapidly eroding. The parades are still a daily event, but they are rapidly shrinking in size and it’s rumoured that Mordacq himself is striking a deal with the government, with talks of total amnesty for his partisans and a comfortable retirement for himself.\n\nThough he is still of course the head of state, the political genius Pétain is long gone: only a tired old man rapidly distancing himself from day to day rule is left and some whisper he has merely become a figurehead for the Redressement Français. All the reforms proposed by the government are lifted straight from their ideas, and the Renewal has turned itself into the propaganda arm of the regime, organising and funding its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime’s stabilisation is entirely due to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think thank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group’s writings. In any case, now that the crisis is dying down the entire nation’s attention is once again turning towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. Uniting behind the figure of the Lion of Verdun, the people will soon be ready to save the patrie, and the French Renewal has a free rein to reform the nation so that she is capable to do so."

After an emotional goodbye to his partisans, the Bear took the first boat to Corsica, holding up the last part of his end of the bargain with the government: a peaceful retirement, far removed from politics and far away from Algiers.\n\nThe crisis that shook the regime is finally, truly over, and it’s finally time to move on and reform the country"

One day some soldiers had brought their service weapons, pretexting a need for self-defense, the next the Camelots themselves were armed and in reaction to this both police and military deployed to maintain order brought out heavier weaponry. Furthermore, while the violence against Mordacq’s partisans had intimidated many, it also brought them much sympathy from the general public and as such more and more civilians took part in the parades. What had started as a rather absurd display of anger by the Grande Muette was now a daily tense standoff from sunrise to sundown, with occasional brawls between protesters and camelots. Miraculously, despite the numerous injuries sustained in the daily brawls, no deaths had occurred at the parades.\n\nThat is, until today. As one of the usual fights broke out between protesters and camelots, a shot rang out, followed by a cry of pain. No one knows who fired it or where it came from, but after a split second of shocked silence, there was chaos. More and more gunshots came from each side, and with each one protesters, camelots, police and military fell to the ground, some wounded, some dead. Initially overwhelmed, the regime forces quickly regained their composure, the sight of their dead comrades shedding any feelings of hesitation they might have had towards fighting against fellow soldiers. Things quickly turned to street to street fighting, with barricades being hastily constructed by protesters engaging in what could only be described as a fighting retreat: most of them being active duty soldiers or veterans, there was certainly confusion, but no panic. Though they have been pushed back to the littoral, the protesters remain in firm control of much of center of Algiers as the government forces await further orders."

Talks with the protesters had gone nowhere, and the lack of central leadership among them would make any consensus impossible anyway. A tense silence had fallen on the conference room in the presidential palace, broken only by the sound of the occasional gunshots. Then, news came: the protesters has seized heavy machine guns, and chosen to fall back further and fortify a large plaza where a field hospital had been set up. Any assault would be extremely costly, and everyone in the room knew it. And then, quietly, almost a whisper:\n\n“...shell them”.\n\nA young navy officer had broken the silence. He continued: “We could shell them. The Liberté class dreadnought Démocratie is anchored a few miles from Algiers, if we wait until nightfall and order her to shell the plaza, it would create enough confusion to storm the camp while minimising damage to the city and losses for our forces. They’re expecting an assault from land, certainly not from the sea”. After a few seconds of silence, the Lion of Verdun angrily stood up, but before he could speak Charles de Gaulle, the Rooster, intervened: “I’m afraid we have no choice here. If we let the situation fester, we could wake up tomorrow morning to a general insurrection: we must nip this revolution in the bud and act fast. I’m sorry Marshal but now is the time of action, not debate.”.\n\nAnd so, as Philippe Pétain fell silent, the order was given."

Tales of mangled bodies, of brutal treatment of prisoners, of summary executions are being spread by communard agents, but our nation knows the truth: the next morning, the front page of all newspapers read: “Attempted Coup Bravely Defeated”. The threat posed by these red traitors has finally been dealt with: the few remaining so-called democrats are now either in custody, awaiting trial for their crimes, in hiding, though they will be found sooner or later, or they lie dead in a mass grave slowly filling up as the plaza is being cleaned up. Henri Mordacq, or what was left of his body, was found and identified by his uniform: the Bear himself is dead and we can now breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nMarshal Pétain is however deeply affected by what happened and has not left the presidential palace since, refusing to see anyone other than his wife and his confessor, only occasionally wandering outside of his quarters, mumbling to himself. As such, Charles de Gaulle has unofficially stepped in to help run governmental affairs for the time being: after all, who better than the Lion’s protégé to make sure things go smoothly in these critical times? Having been promoted to the rank of general for his bravery and skill dealing with the crisis, France’s stability is now the utmost priority of the Rooster, and as such he has launched a new large scale investigation to find and bring to justice any and all of those who might have been involved in this attempted coup.

Though we could have feared instability after the Marshal’s temporary condition had been made public, de Gaulle’s energetic guidance, his status as a respected war hero, as protégé of Pétain, and his own personal prestige alleviated the fears of many. The sheer scale of the corruption has been dutifully reported by the media, and each day a new arrest, a new scandal shocks our people, who finally, truly understand this truth: just as the Rooster had described it in La Discorde, the worst threat facing us does not come from outside our borders, but from within. The defeats, the struggles, the sacrifices now all make sense: our efforts had been sabotaged, wasted by inside forces.\n\nHowever our efforts to finally once and for all deal with the parasites plaguing the patrie are still being restricted by petty liberal concerns, and de Gaulle realises that extraordinary measures must be taken to ensure the salvation of France. As such he has come to Philippe Pétain with a proposal: for the Lion of Verdun to resign as president of the French Republic to enjoy a glorious retirement and be able to care for his clearly ailing health, and for a motion to be presented in front of the National Assembly granting the government full powers to create and promulgate a new constitution, better suited to defend national interests.

His closing statement calling for peaceful transition of power and reaffirming his full trust in de Gaulle to guide the nation in these troubled times and in the people to continue the fight to retake the métropole, Marshal Pétain ended his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from his iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, immediately followed by thunderous applause and a long standing ovation. As the applause died down, a voice resonated: “Maréchal, merci!”, “Marshal, thank you!”, a breach of protocol that all in the room immediately happily imitated.

While they will of course be promptly dealt with, some within the Action Française advise taking advantage of this crisis to finally once and for all cleanse the French body from the stain of republicanism and take down the parasitic groups dragging France down in one fell swoop."

When the names of those accused of treason and conspiracy against the state for their involvement with Henri Mordacq and his partisans were published and the reveal of the treachery of so many respected statesmen, military men, and generally public personalities was revealed, the public was deeply shocked. However, our people can finally put a name and a face on the deep rooted corruption that plagued the Republic, finally they can rest easy knowing that those that created the troubles of the past months, and by extension, much of the struggles they have gone through since the Grande Guerre will hinder France no longer, that they have finally been brought to justice. Finally, the patrie can move forward, first by reforming herself following our king’s guidance, and then by setting her sights on the métropole, still reeling under communard oppression."

However, since the names of those accused was published and placarded everywhere, a new wave of violence has swept through the nation. Overzealous camelots have been targeting the family and friends of those on trial, as well as more generally all and any open republicans, with harassment and rapidly escalating violence. Yesterday, it was jeers and insults, today, beatings and property damage, but with the police rarely intervening, who knows where it will stop. The population, taken in the frenzy and wanting to make those responsible for France’s suffering pay has started joining as well, often collectively proving more violent against the perceived enemies of the patrie than the most committed of the camelots. Some are fleeing, others hope the collective wrath will simply pass, though it is quickly becoming uncontrollable. The political disagreements of yesterday have turned into blind rage and some are even taking advantages of the general frenzy to settle personal feuds, either joining the mob and influencing it into going after personal enemies, or denouncing as liberals, as Mordacq-sympathiser, as republicans whoever slighted them. However, this orgy of violence could prove cathartic for our people, as they can finally rest easy knowing the enemy within will no longer hinder.

However, many of those reforms were already controversial atop the chain of command, and now that they are being implemented, they have put some within the armed forces on high alert regarding the next moves of General Mordacq. Furthermore, the call for deep reform by the new head of state is seen by many civilians as a prelude to the restoration of democratic life, though Mordacq has so far not challenged the state of emergency that has held France in democratic limbo for the last decade. The simmering hope has reached the ranks of the military, among which many already anxious at the prospect of the military reforms are at best sceptical of an eventual return to parliamentary democracy as war looms ever closer. A worry that their fellow reactionary officers have been quick to exploit, convincing some former Pétain loyalists that Mordacq was a poor choice over the much more conservative de Gaulle.\n\nIn any case, this barrack gossip is unlikely to have deeper consequences, Mordacq is a respected theorist and war hero, and the appointed successor of the Lion of Verdun. We could, however, contact the old Marshal, and ask him to briefly come out of retirement for a speech addressed to the troops not so subtly calling for more unity within the ranks."

The Lion made a surprise appearance at a ceremony honouring soldiers being decorated for their heroic deeds patrolling the Sahara, gave their well-deserved medals to the men, before making a lengthy speech to the numerous assembly. Each and every one of them listened intently to the man who so recently still dominated the life of the nation, from the humblest of infantrymen to the most decorated officers present. They all heard loud and clear the message the Marshal was methodically laying out. Taking the tone of a disappointed grandfather, he compared the current situation of France to a lengthy trek across the hostile desert, where every resource is precious but the most important thing is cohesion within the group, for men to trust and rely on each other so that they may reach their destination. He strongly praised his successor and reaffirmed his trust in Mordacq’s ability and deeply reform the nation and her armed forces, before announcing that he would fully retire from public life, an announcement that ushered a wave of shock and whispers across the room. Receiving a standing ovation no less sincere than the one he received when he resigned as head of state, the Marshal reminded his great call of Verdun, one, last, time."

The men publicly criticized General Mordacq and were overheard by civilians, who did not take kindly to insult, and the two groups rapidly came to blows. Law enforcement rapidly intervened, but not after multiple bars were trashed in the fighting that engulfed the whole street. Reportedly, the men called their opponents, and by extension the Bear, crypto-Communards, who would lead France down the road to parliamentary chaos and perpetual exile. This matter could have been handled by local police, but the cause of the men has been taken up by the Action Française, who calls the drunkards patriots standing up against the interior enemies, and demands their immediate release. Local authorities have refused to comment on the situation, but this incident is a troubling sign of the tensions flaring up within the armed forces."

The man was seemingly brutally beaten before being shot numerous times and could only be identified thanks to the military identification he was carrying. In full uniform and carrying a substantial amount of money, a robbery gone wrong is unlikely: the man was, however, a known supporter of the General and has recently risen to some prominence by publicly supporting an end to the state of emergency and return to normal democratic life. As such, the Deuxième Bureau has taken over the investigation, believing that this is the work of forces opposed to the regime. The democratic press has not waited for confirmation, however, and already calls the man a victim of the Action Française. The royalist newspaper, on the other hand, is all but celebrating the news, being quick to point out that the man’s purpose in the seedy area remains unknown, peddling theories to besmirch the memory of the officer, ranging from a visit to the Casbah’s brothels to ominous conspiracy with supposed Communard agents."

nfa.93.t:0 "The Sleeping Beauties"
nfa.93.d:0 "Despite the suspension of the constitutional laws following the revolution, the regime was keen to at least preserve the illusion of democracy: the parliament remained in place, and though for a decade now it has only rubber-stamped the decision of the Marshal, his right to hold the rein of power still, in theory, comes from the people’s representatives. As such, the various parties still exist, with a presidential coalition and an opposition publicly debating, though no one in the République is foolish enough to believe they hold any kind of real power. However, emboldened by the election of Henri Mordacq that they perceive as a friend to the cause of democracy, the long slumbering political parties have finally awakened. Though they would never dare publicly denounce the regime that they have dutifully supported since the exile, representatives from the main parties asked for a discrete private meeting with the Bear.\n\nThere, they explained their concerns to General Mordacq. While some among them spoke of the ideals of the Republic, of the moral duty to restore democracy, most had reached a much more practical conclusion: the people are losing trust in the regime, and its future seems bleak. For now, the popular hope for reform has focused around Mordacq. Despite his calls for deep reform, he remains largely politically aligned with the Pétain regime, with the same unflinching aim: retaking the métropole and taking down the Reds. As such, these deputies have proposed simply giving in to popular demands, declaring the state of emergency over, restoring the constitutional laws for the good of the stability of the republic, and calling for new elections, allowing a semblance of normal democratic life to flourish once again in the Republic.\n\nThe General was not unmoved by such arguments but has refused to give a straight answer regarding his intentions."

Although they officially respect and obey hierarchies, orders tend to get mysteriously lost, and the units under the control of known sympathisers seem to only tenuously follow the orders given to them. We believe they are the men behind the slaughter in the Casbah, and according to our infiltrated agents of the Second Bureau, they are preparing their next move. If we are not careful, their influence could become strong enough to carry on a coup against our regime.\n\nBut we will not stay around idly, we must take proactive steps. With the help of the Second bureau, we might be able to counter their move and prevent a coup, but our success remains uncertain in these conditions. To better the odds, we could try to contact the leaders of the various parties represented in parliament: although they have de facto little political power, they still have deep connections to the financial and industrial elite of our country and might be able to successfully deprive the Action Française of its financial support. Furthermore, de La Rocque’s PSF could provide invaluable help in preventing a coup. However, it is unlikely they will accept to do so without compensation, and we will have to negotiate for their support."

The Bear, whether he wants it or not, has been associated with the so-recently still somewhat alienated partisans of democracy, and he is quickly running out of allies, though the recent intervention of Marshal Pétain has soothed the worries of some.\n\nAs such, a discrete meeting was called with the head of the various parties, in the hope of finding a solution to the current situation. To the surprise of Mordacq, the president of the PSF had a concrete proposal: he would use the vast reach and infrastructure of his mass party to support the General and his reform, while the more traditional parties would throw their resources into the fight to counter the current media offensive by the Action Française against the regime. In exchange, the General would announce an end to the state of emergency, publicly promise a return to normal within a reasonable timeframe. Furthermore, a new government would have to be formed, a new Union Sacrée, a broad coalition of Republican parties working together to ensure the future of the Republic. It’s an ambitious plan: despite Mordacq being a long-time believer in democracy, he shares popular concern over immediate restoration.

As such, the main democratic parties are represented in this new government, and they will carry together the fight against both syndicalism and autocracy, putting aside their ideological differences for the good of the Republic.\n\nWhether such a coalition will prove to be able to lead France effectively remains to be seen, but immediately celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities: indeed, it seems many had long hoped for radical reform and a more democratic future.

And yet, this radio intervention had the opposite effect: PSF members, as well as untold numbers of civilians, flooded the streets, to the stunned surprise of the units deployed, some more isolated groups of soldiers even getting scorned like children by the mod, before being peacefully disarmed and arrested. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of the Action Française, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of General Mordacq and his new government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the supposed crimes the Bear had supposedly committed and a call for an immediate vote. This was met with applause by some reactionary members of parliaments, who were immediately shouted down by the rest of the Assembly. Soldiers attempted to restore order but were unsuccessful.\n\nMinutes after this, troops loyal to the regime surrounded the Assembly and forced entry into the building.

Liberals have already begun a smear campaign against de La Rocque’s PSF claiming the Colonel merely intends to take advantage of the return of democracy by using his mass party to take over the Republic and instore a renewed dictatorship. In response, the PSF has used its wide reach to feed tales of collaboration between Communard agents and the more left-leaning of the Radicals to the media, insinuating that they are traitors just waiting for the right opportunity to invite the Communards into Algiers and destroy any chance of salvation for France.\n\nTo the frustration of the General, this turn of events has proven to be positive for only the royalists of the Action Française, their ranks increasingly bolstered by many former Pétain loyalists. The monarchist daily has been relishing in the stories coming out of the Assembly, retelling any argument in colourful details: after all, if this is what restoration of parliamentary democracy was always about, maybe it’s not worth the trouble."

While he still discusses policies with politicians from all sides and has frequent contacts with industrialists, they are mere advisors and Mordacq will keep the final say in all decisions taken.\n\nHowever, the threat caused by the Action Française is still very present, and we need to do something about it. Despite the support of the Second Bureau, their numbers are limited, and they will need time to infiltrate the Action Française. Time is running short, and our room for manoeuvre is shrinking.

Retirement had clearly not blunted the shrewdness of the Lion, for he had an offer for the Bear: both were aware that the days of the regime in its current form were numbered, whether the threat would come from royalists toppling the Republic or too much cooperation with democrats paralysing the state was the only question. As such, Marshal Pétain would once again offer his help to Mordacq, contact former loyalists lost to the AF, as well privately endorse the regime in social occasions with the rich and powerful as much as needed. In exchange, however, his successor would have to agree to not restore parliamentary democracy immediately, and to only do so only once France was whole once again, and stable: too much was at stake to leave politicians in charge.\n\nThe General, sharing his scepticism towards parliament, immediately agreed."

Everywhere he looked, more and more evidence of the incredibly deep rot affecting the République came to light. Tasked with saving France, the General had come to a simple conclusion, that today he exposed in a speech in front of the Senate:\n\n\"Trusted with the arduous task of guiding the nation in these hazardous times, I must put the patrie above all. Above my personal feelings, above petty convictions, above divisions. As such, I have come to the conclusion that a system born in the fires of revolution cannot extinguish the fire of another, and that any constitution my government could put together couldn’t be enough to ensure the safety and future of our nation. As such, as chief of state of the French Republic, with the powers granted to me by the people, I hereby declare that to ensure the salvation of France we should look towards the fundamental laws, the laws that governed our nation and made her glory since times immemorial, the laws of the kingdom. As such, for the good of France and her people, as a subject, I hereby humbly ask monseigneur the Duke de Guise, heir of forty kings who over a millennia made France, to seize the crown and guide us towards the resurrection, the renewal of France.\"\n\nTruth is, no one was surprised by this speech. Neither the parliamentarians nor the people. General de Gaulle’s sympathies for the monarchy and the royalist Action Française were no secret, and forces loyal to the regime and the AF, in the media, the Church, the armed forces, had worked tirelessly to cement the idea of restoration in the public consciousness. The defeat and the revolution had already severely damaged the image of the République, recent events made sure few were still truly attached to her. The senators gave de Gaulle a long-standing ovation, named him Lieutenant-General of the reborn kingdom, regent in other words, before voting to dissolve the legislative chambers.

# Post-War Events

nfa.179.t:0 "The Question of Montmartre"
nfa.179.d:0 "Paris, the most beautiful city on Earth, has been freed from the grasps of the Communard. Under their rule, she had often been martyrized, defaced by radical avant-garde architecture and urban planning. Many buildings had been damaged during the revolution, and now the war has brought more destruction: as such, plans for the restoration of the City of Lights to her pre-revolutionary beauty have already been hastily thrown together as we discover the damage for the first time. However, one question remains: what should be done with Montmartre? The hill, towering above Paris, has a rich history: starting point of the 1871 Commune, later on a romantic village within the city and most importantly where an immense neo-byzantine basilica, the Sacré-Cœur, was being built, funded by donations from all over France. Close to completion when the revolution broke out, the basilica was never consecrated and was the site of a last hold out of loyalist forces. Damaged by the fighting, the building was gleefully torn down by the Communards, who saw it as a reactionary symbol as it was built to expiate the crimes of the original Commune of Paris. In its stead they built a modernist Palace of the People, where their attempt at government met.\n\nWe have received multiple proposals for the future of Montmartre, what should be done?"
nfa.179.a:0 "Destroy the Palace and rebuild the Sacré-Coeur, twice as magnificent!"
nfa.179.b:0 "Destroy the Palace and build an immense memorial for the victims of the revolution!"
nfa.179.c:0 "Keep the Palace, but turn it into a permanent exhibit on the folly of syndicalism."

nfa.180.t:0 "Les Procès - The Military"
nfa.180.d:0 "Gamelin, Tanguy, Billotte, Makhno, Catroux, Delestraint... the name of the defendants' echoes in the halls of the High Military Court specially assembled to pass judgement on the officers of the Commune. Many of them had served in the French armed forces, joining the mutineers out of conviction or self-interest, others were foreigners who sought to serve the cause of the revolution. Many are present, stoic, or dazed, or crying hysterically. Some are still in hiding, some fled, and will have to be condemned in absentia. Each case is carefully examined by a court of officers, the defendant is charged with treason, mutiny, desertion, conspiracy against France, sometimes other accusations, and the verdict falls, inevitably: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.\n\nOne question remains, how to sentence the guilty. The typical sentence for military traitors is death by firing squad, however, even among our own military, there are calls for leniency on some of these officers, as they had contacted our intelligence services during or even before the war hoping to switch sides, arguing they had simply been thrust into serving a cause they did not believe in. Others argue that conflicts in the future are likely and that France cannot sacrifice talented officers."
nfa.180.a:0 "Mercy? For traitors? Au mur!"
nfa.180.b:0 "Arrange firing squads for the true believers. Imprison the rest."
nfa.180.c:0 "Desyndicalise some, imprison the majority and make examples of the diehard supporters."

nfa.181.t:0 "Les Procès - The Leaders"
nfa.181.d:0 "For weeks now, dozens of high-profile Communards have been on trial in front of the High Court of Justice, assembled in the Palace of Justice in the capital. These men and women are all facing a litany of accusations: treason, sedition, conspiracy against France, corruption... enumerated by the prosecutor, resonating in the high halls, the numerous audience inside and outside the courthouse staying deathly silent, the building surrounded by military forces to prevent any risk of last-ditch effort to rescue these traitors. Their names sound familiar to our people keenly informed these last few years of their numerous crimes against France during and since the revolution: Faure, Pivert, Thorez, Jouhaux, Blum, Laval, Sartre, and many, many others. They have been given ample time to prepare their defence, some doing so admirably, others going as far as testifying against each other in hopes of reducing their sentence, or on the contrary, choosing to remain entirely silent.\n\nMost of them have been found guilty of the crimes they were accused of: what should their sentence be? Death is the expected sentence, but this would certainly create martyrs. On the other hand, a lighter sentence could seem like a show of weakness to our supporters, and convincing our people that any of these Reds deserve mercy when they refused to show any to anyone standing in the way of their crazed revolution could prove difficult."
nfa.181.a:0 "Madame la Guillotine and her unquenchable thirst awaits."
nfa.181.b:0 "We are better than these godless Reds, show some mercy."

nfa.182.t:0 "Les Procès - The Cadres"

Our occupying forces have turned a blind to these barely legitimate courts when they don’t outright supply the guns to shoot the traitors. Simply put, our reconquered people are tearing each other apart, blowing up in anger for they finally see the Reds for what they truly are, enemies of France who led them all to their collective downfall. However, these trials may have gone somewhat out of control, with unsavoury reports coming in of cruel punishments or settling of personal vendettas by the simple accusation of being a committed socialist. Furthermore, the more legalistic among us argue that this usurpation of state authority cannot be tolerated.\n\nWhat should be done?"
nfa.182.a:0 "May this rightful anger consume the remnants of the Commune."
nfa.182.b:0 "Call for order! Even this scum deserves a proper trial."

nfa.185.t:0 "C’est Nous les Africains..."
nfa.185.d:0 "Now that war is over, those who had chosen exile during the revolution are slowly making their way back. For some, it is a joyous ending to this fratricidal conflict as families are reunited and many rediscover their homeland. For others, it is a tragedy: their kin might have disappeared, their neighbourhood destroyed during the war, or their property collectivized. Some scars will take generations to heal, but the most pressing issue is that of seized property: many are clamouring for what was theirs to be given back.\n\nWe could simply declare all transfer of property undertaken under the syndicalist regime to be null, but expropriating untold numbers of families would certainly not endear us to our reunited people. We could also accept the status quo, legitimize the ownership of seized property, and simply give indemnities to the exiles, but this might feel like a slap in the face to many. Finally, we could set up local committees investigating the claims of returning owners, which would then find a fair compromise between both parties, though this might prove complex and time-consuming."

nfa.185.b:0 "We need to tread carefully, grant indemnities to the exiles."
nfa.185.c:0 "Set up committees, let’s try to find compromise."

nfa.186.t:0 "Republicanization of the Army"
nfa.186.d:0 "The recent attempted coup by reactionary elements within the armed forces has proved us that there are still many traitors within our midsts, principally royalists and Pétain loyalists who refuse to accept his decision to give up power. We cannot afford to simply purge the ranks of the armed forces from all reactionaries, the Grande Muette has hardly ever been in favor of liberal democracy. Instead, we will use a skillful mix of tactical promotions, making sure loyalists rise in ranks, and reassignments: others will be sent in the depths of the desert to monitor some tribe or another. It will be a long process, but it will certainly be effective.\n\nSome within the coalition also hope to cement their influence over our armies, and hope to discreetly include supporters of their opponents among those sent on long Saharan treks, however this would certainly be seen as a great injustice inflicted on loyal Republicans."
nfa.186.a:0 "Make sure the reactionaries won’t create further issues"
nfa.186.b:0 "Send the reactionaries away and some of the PSF’s allies too"

It is even rumoured that Mordacq himself intervened to prevent the coalition from entirely breaking apart in these critical times, and personally asked for the formation of a new government as a  conciliatory measure. This new government headed by the PRD’s Paul Reynaud was presented to the Assembly later in the day and passed a near unanimous vote of confidence.\n\nOf course, this change in course does not mean that the PSF or de La Rocque are now in opposition with the government, and the Colonel himself does not see this as the end of his bid for power: after all the PSF is still an important party, and future electoral fortunes could certainly bring him back in the forefront of politics.

Today, the Colonel announced in front of the Assembly his plans for a constitutional referendum once the war is won, one that would thoroughly transform the institutions of the Republic and create a semi-presidential, democratic, more stable regime, instead of a Republic dominated by her fickle parliament. This was entirely expected of the Colonel, as this has been part of the PSF’s platform since the creation of the party. However, he ended this speech by saying that this constitutional reform would be voted on by referendum, as he argues that the French people are after all sovereign: for reform of such importance, they are the most qualified to decide upon the future of the nation.\n\nThis immediately created an uproar among partisans of the supremacy of parliament. Indeed the last time a referendum was used in such a way, it was by President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to bury the Second Republic. Name calling, accusations of tyranny flew across the hemicycle, members of parliament even came to blows, and by the end of the day it was clear the Union Sacrée had only the nominal support of much of his former allies. As such, a new government was formed under de La Rocque with those sympathetic to his plans, though President Mordacq intervened so that the appearance of unity remains in this critical time. The traditional parties of the Third Republic, in no small part responsible for her fall, have simply been left behind in the dust as Mordacq continues to revolutionise French politics."

After hearing of the news, Napoléon VI paraded magnificently in Paris. He drove down the Champs-Elysées aboard a military vehicle, encircled by a mass of Parisians shouting his name and followed by 3 columns of the best veterans of the last French wars. Napoléon accompanied these warriors first in the reconquest of France and then in the great war to finally retake Alsace-Lorraine. He didn't only command them but fought along them with only the pride of France as his ideal.\n\nThe people of France are now rewarding the War Hero appropriately, they recognised his valor and decided to offer him the throne as a show of their faith in him. The republican politicians were outraged by what they call a coup d'Etat, but Napoléon knows that the French nation is in its people and not its politicians. The emperor didn't get an official religious coronation, choosing to base his legitimacy on the mandate of the people rather than on the church, but did end his Parisian parade with an impressive mass at the church of the Madeleine to show the friendship of the Empire with the thousand-year-old French Catholic church.\n\nThe form of the new state will be a constitutional monarchy. Napoléon VI will thus rule alongside an elected parliament to best serve the interests of the people. The current parliament, dominated by the Bloc National, will be kept and will serve as the first legislature under the Empire.

The next step to rebuild France in its glory is political. The CSN has been designed since the start to be temporary until the Métropole can be retaken. Mordacq promised several times that once the time comes, the Republic and democracy will be restored in France following the old constitution of the IIIrd Republic.\n\n The time has now come. Mordacq convened a reunion of the CSN for the last time this morning, he thanked everyone for their hard work and determination in saving France before announcing that the CSN will be dissolved at the end of the reunion and replaced by a democratic civilian government, of which the first elections will be held soon. The democratic political scene has had a hard time organising in exile but it now seems to be divided between a moderate left-wing tendency led by the Radicals and an union of conservative parties led by the PSF. After this election will come, as planned by the constitution, the election of the President for 7 years. Until the election can come Mordacq has also announced he will stay as an interim President, in that role he will be able to preside over the democratic transition and make sure it goes as intended."

nfa.250.d:0 "For a long time, we held out hope that the occupation of many of our previous owned colonies to the Germans would be short. Their widespread expansion across the globe may have produced the conditions needed for them to collapse. But the Syndicalist regime in the Métropole failed to disintegrate and we have been forced to remain entrenched in Algiers, staring daggers at our brothers and sisters across the Mediterranean. Then, our long standing ally in the United Kingdom fell apart in 1925 leaving us in no condition to return our colonies to our rule. Ending the last of his tenure as the Governor-General of what remains of French Equatorial Africa, Raphaël Antonetti has made his decision to step down from his post citing a failing in his health in recent years. Antonetti has held the position since 1924, seeing the region through several turbulent times, and well earning his retirement after his service.\n\nWith the seat left vacant, it may now be time to merge our two colonial sub saharan governments into one unified administration. The German Empire remains ascendant across the globe and the split focus on resource allocation is a waste of time and effort. With only a narrow portion of the colonial region of Chad remaining of French Equatorial Africa, we must move to merge Chad into the French West Africa administration. Some day our rightful territory might return to us, but that day is not today."

The time has come to ease the yolk off the backs of the native population. We must take immediate measures to give power back over to the native chiefs and local powers.

For years, he had been escaping the grasps of both police and our intelligence services, assassinating and bombing at will. His goal had apparently been to make his organisation’s schemes out to be Communard or Indigènes plots, to goad the Pétain regime into cracking down further, but few were still credulous enough to believe this. His reign of terror is over, but the question remains: what should be done with him? A military tribunal would certainly sentence him to death, but his skills are undeniable and he has offered to serve the Republic in exchange for his life."

Following a secret investigation by Deloncle and his group "les 400 coups", we have identified an agency within the Second Bureau, named the \"Corvignolles network\", led by the nationalist colonel George Groussard. Despite his former allegiance to the democratic forces, he is still a good Communard-hating Frenchman, and it would be a shame to let his skills go to waste: we can send him to the Commune, where he will fight the Communard scum while being unable to represent a threat to our regime. Or, just say the word, and Deloncle will take care of him once and for all."

Most of our agents lost their trace, and we found the corpses of those who did not in the middle of the street. Groussard made sure to leave no evidence in his hideout by setting it in fire before leaving, reducing everything but a single piece of paper to ashes.

In order to do so however, the law of exile banning heirs of the old imperial dynasties signed in 1886 must be repealed. Louis wishes to join the Algiers academy and offer his military service for the country. Repealing the law may bring some greater levels of support for our government from the monarchist camp, and France needs all the soldiers she can get.

nfa.310.d:0 "His Majesty Jean III, By the Grace of God, Most Christian King of France has passed away peacefully at 65 years old, in his palace of Algiers. Until his last breath, our King had been eager to serve his country and his nation in the place that was his, a country that he loved with unconditional love, the love of a father, for France and for the French, considering each as his children. Having served in the Great War, since his rise as head of the French Capetians he worked tirelessly to propose an alternative to the failing republic and after de Gaulle’s fateful call to restore the monarchy, to implement the deep reform needed to truly restore the Kingdom of France. But the burden of his increased responsibilities proved too much to bear for the monarch, already deeply affected by the defeat and the exile, and his health had been on a steady decline for some time. The dauphin had stepped in to relieve his father but this wasn’t sufficient, and those in the know knew that the passing of the King was only a matter of time. Part of Jean III’s dream to see his kingdom restored had come true, and with his family attending to him in his last moments, particularly his son the dauphin and his grandson Henri, he knew that the future was assured, that he was leaving the kingdom in good hands, that France would soon be freed, that all the sacrifices endured by his people and by himself had not been in vain, that, at last, he could rest.\n\nA week of national mourning has been decreed, at the end of which King Jean will be buried. Jean, departed from this world and now close to God, is succeeded by his eldest son, Henri, 32 years old. The energetic young man has been particularly active in working first towards the restoration in cooperation with the Action Française, then since his father’s coronation in the matters of state. These last few years, bustling with political activity, have made sure the young prince is more than ready as a statesman, as a shrewd politician, and as King to further his father’s dream.\n\nThe King is dead, long live the King!"

Popular festivities lasted late into the night, and this morning, two things are clear: the continuity of the monarchy is now well assured, and our nation must now be more determined than ever to free our countrymen from the red shackles of the Commune, so that one day the kings of France may be crowned in Reims once again."

After swearing the traditional oaths and being anointed with oil from the Holy Ampulla, the prince was dressed in the regalia of the kings of France, including some thought lost in the exile like the hand of justice and the scepter of Charles VI, before finally being crowned by the archbishop of Reims. Peers of the reborn kingdom and indigenous chiefs swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said.\n\nOutside the cathedral, though there were cheers and cries of 'Long live the King' along with jeers and insults, the crowd seemed mostly perplexed by this surreal sight: after all, it had been more than a century since a king was last crowned in Reims, and two decades under the Commune had certainly made it seem impossible that such an event would happen again. And so, instead of heading back to the residence of the archbishops of Reims for a private reception, His Majesty chose to head out of the cathedral on foot accompanied by his young son, mingling for some time with his new subjects, almost to prove to the reconquered nation, and perhaps to himself, that this was all indeed real: the red beast was slain, the kingdom was well and truly reborn, this war pitting brothers against brothers was over. Henri VI then delivered a speech radio transmitted throughout France and her empire, assuring that with his coronation, a new era has dawned, an era of order, peace and prosperity, and that all the sacrifices France had endured will not be in vain. While in some areas popular celebrations lasted well into the night, in others riots broke out: the King will have to prove himself to much of our nation."

Special tribunals were created, with the crowd gathering in every town to see those who had betrayed them for so long get what was long coming. At last the “pays légal” was tumbling. Trials were often somewhat rushed, but most were given time to prepare their defense, with proper legal assistance provided if they could not afford one.

Or at least, that is what much of those interrogated by martial court assure us, perhaps cowed by Mordacq’s untimely fate. In any case, though some will have to be shot, at the very least to set an example, most of the men interrogated could be reintegrated within the ranks without much penalty: the core of Mordacq’s clique was blown apart along with their leader, and unified opposition from the armed forces seems unlikely"

It seems that a large part of the Bureau was sympathetic to Mordacq, and though they have dutifully helped us purge other elements of society, they have also carefully hidden proof that some of them were in contact with our enemies, even going as far as destroying seized evidence. We must however tread carefully: these are all incredibly talented men, and our investigation seems to show that they acted more by loyalty to each other than any deep ideological commitment. The Rooster, personally close to some of the men of the Bureau, seems to think that simply court-circuiting the mole, feeding him inaccurate information for him to share to planted contacts and letting the Bureau remain intact will be sufficient: after all there are few open Republicans left, sacrificing valuable assets to fight shadows seems like a waste. Others argue that the Bureau cannot be trusted, and that as such it should be disbanded and replaced, with some of the less trustworthy members assigned to posts far in the Saharan desert. Finally, simply getting rid of all of them might be the easiest choice."

It is possible however that we hit too much on the Republicans in some sectors, lowering our efficency there, or contrarily that we didn't hit on them enough, which means some parts of the State aren't entirely under our control yet. But ultimately this can't endanger the regime anymore. In any way we can thank our Camelots du Roi and our investigators for this well-rounded affair and we can now only hope that this newfound loyalty will last."

nfa.401.d:0 "Critical to the stability of the regime, the Society of the Missionaries of Africa is a Catholic society of apostolic life focusing on evangelism and education in Africa. Founded in 1868 in Algiers, they quickly became an integral part of colonial society, adapting to native customs, adopting the native dress, all the while accomplishing a tremendous amount of ethnographical and geographic research. They have been on the forefront of French initiatives on the continent, despite their sometimes strained relationship with an increasingly anticlerical republican government. They have become staunch advocates for the native populations, even accepting native priests, never hesitating to side with them against the colonial authorities when needed and generally acting as a bridge between the two, earning them the affectionate nickname of \"White Fathers\".\n\nIn the troubled times since the revolution, they have become downright crucial to maintaining French authority over what is left of the empire, working tirelessly to maintain the peace between colonists, exiles, and natives with the full support of the Marshal’s conservative government."

nfa.402.d:0 "Founded in the ’20s by Ferhat Abbas in the chaos of the exile, calling itself the principal media outlet of integral nationalism alongside the main Action Française, Action Algérienne has become one of the most popular newspapers within the Algerian departments. Its slogan, \"From Colony to Province\", summarises its fight alongside integralist principles: assimilation within a greater France, while still retaining privileges, traditions and local laws against the centralisation and disregard for indigenous customs of the Republic. Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber Muslim population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the indigènes."

nfa.403.d:0 "Jacques Bainville, born in 1879, renowned historian, journalist, and one of the founders of the Action Française, has died at 57 years old. Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled \"The Political Consequences of Peace\", Bainvillle exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among exiles, and Bainville’s funeral procession was followed by thousands of mourners, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending his funeral mass. The Lion of Verdun himself put out a statement honouring the life and works of the historian now seen as a prophet by many."

The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture. It stands as a powerful symbol of the success of missionary work within the French colonial empire and especially that of the Pères Blancs. It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thénévoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thénévoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed. However, the apostolic vicar has always dismissed claims that true power in Haute-Volta lies with him, presenting himself as nothing more than a humble missionary blessed with some success, caring for his flock."

Though the results of these policies are only just starting to be felt, Mothers’ Day has caught on as a truly popular celebration, is now widely celebrated in schools and homes across the nation to the delight of mothers everywhere, and it has become customary for children to bring home little gifts for their mothers, and for husbands to make sure this is a special day for wives and of course for their own mothers. In a speech broadcast on the radio today, [NFA.GetLeader] reminded women that \"Only you can give to future generations the taste for honest work, this sense of discipline, of modesty, of respect which makes healthy men and a strong nation.

nfa.406.d:0 "\"Integral Humanism. Temporal and spiritual problems of a new Christianity\", the recently published work of influential Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain has caused passionate debate among Catholics. A convert from Protestantism, once close to the Action Française despite not being a monarchist, mostly out of suspicion towards representative democracy and opposition to the anticlerical policies of the Third Republic, Maritain has drifted after the shock of the exile towards more moderate positions, closer to the personalist movement and Christian democracy. Rejecting both reaction and liberalism, secularism and intransigent political Catholicism, embracing humanism, arguing for human rights, the importance of family, pluralistic democracy and responsibility toward the common good, all in the spirit of the social teachings of the Church, the philosopher is somewhat going against the grain. Indeed, much of the French Catholic laity and hierarchy has been radicalised by the current situation: the AF has even denounced \"Integral Humanism\" as the work of a traitor, a sell-out to \"democratism\", a red saboteur. However among more progressive Catholics Maritain’s work was very well received, getting praise from Father Montini, a close advisor of the pope, and with some moderates even being drawn away from the Action Française, heeding his warning that the movement is merely using the Faith as a tool to further their political ideology."

The movie, retelling the life of Blessed Charles de Foucauld, had found critical acclaim and great commercial success: indeed, he has fascinated the French public for years now. Charles Eugène, viscount de Foucauld would have seemed for much of his early life an unlikely candidate for the devotion now surrounding him. Born into an aristocratic family, he lived a dissolute life, eventually becoming a cavalry officer. This experience spurred him to leave his old life behind: he decided to take the vows, attracted by an ascetic life of poverty among the Tuaregs with whom he formed deep bonds, learning their language, translating the Scriptures, and preaching through example. Seen as a saintly man by natives, authorities and the Church’s hierarchy, a tragic end awaited him: caught in the conflict with the Senussi, he was martyred on the 1st of December 1916.\n\nDesert hermit, saintly martyr, pioneer of French influence in the most remote corners of the empire, Father Charles became a national icon, his total abandonment to God and asceticism inspiring many Catholics, leading some to rethink their positions on native populations and Islam as a whole. His recent beatification has even led the Academy of Colonial Sciences to petition the papacy so that he be made patron saint of colonisation: the regime, however, hasn’t waited for him to be officially recognised as such, and prominently uses him as a propaganda piece, despite de Foucauld’s frequent criticism of colonial attitudes."

nfa.408.d:0 "On June 7 1919, riots broke out in Valletta, capital of the then British crown colony of Malta. Tensions with the British authorities had brewed for some time and the heavy burden of the Weltkrieg on the fortress island, as well as rising food prices, proved too much for thousands who ransacked locations associated with the British: when they attempted to force entry into a government building, soldiers opened fire. The crowd dispersed, and four laid dead. Ever since this grim day, it has been commemorated by the Maltese. As the British revolution came to a close in 1926, local authorities became increasingly nervous for the future of Malta, with mutiny, nationalist and socialist agitation, or occupation by another power seeming like increasingly real threats: the Germans being already in the process of seizing much of the empire would certainly not pass up an opportunity to spread their influence to the Mittelmeer. As such, the governor, Sir Walter Norris Congreve, called on us to secure the islands for the Entente, and French marine infantry obliged. Malta was granted much autonomy in dealing with day to day matters, officially still part of the British Empire but by now effectively a French protectorate, a state of affairs acceptable to both the small British elite content with maintaining their power and nationalists now enjoying something approaching home rule. As such, the Sette Giugno was made an official holiday of remembrance and hope for unity. Though no longer the headquarter of the Mediterranean fleet, the island is still the lock of the Strait of the Sicily, the bastion assuring Entente dominance over the Western Mediterranean: a large garrison is maintained on the island and much was invested to expand the defences and ports of the islands, reflecting its critical role in our naval strategy."

It was dedicated to the tens of thousands of Corsicans who gave their lives for France during the Weltkrieg and subsequent civil war. Since the revolution, the island has been an incredibly important bastion for us: indeed, it is so close from the Commune that its shores can be seen on a clear day, while Red Italy is less than 40 kilometres away. As such it has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and airbase from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the mainland, with tense face-offs with Internationale ships occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of exiles landed, and though most moved on to Algeria, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that paired with the military build-up has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms. Though there is no longer a stream of refugees like in the early days of the Commune, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero’s welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul \"the Emperor\" Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the métropole. The authorities, however, turn a blind eye to this, as the mafia has proved to be an incredibly useful network of informants within the Commune, all the while attending to the baser needs of infantrymen and officers alike."

Fascinated with the idea of flying and inspired by the prototypes of French engineer Clément Ader and the successes of the Wright brothers, Blériot put the profits of his automobile parts business towards the creation of flying machines. First encountering so many failures that the press derisively nicknamed him the \"King of Crashing\", he eventually achieved worldwide fame and recognition for being the first to cross the Channel in an aeroplane in 1909, in only 37 minutes. A living legend of aviation, even being attributed to the first pilot’s license, he created a successful firm building his ever-improving designs. With the Great War, he specialised in light reconnaissance planes, his company producing eventually more than ten thousand planes for the French army. At the outbreak of the revolution, Blériot fled to Algeria like so many others and successfully re-implemented his business, Blériot Aéronautique, the Marshal encouraging research and development in any field with any potential to help the coming war effort, eventually running as a candidate for the Parti Radical.\n\nFollowing his death, the government has put out a statement honouring his contribution to the field of aviation and to the war effort, as well as his resilience facing his early setback, calling him an example to all Frenchmen in these difficult times. The creation of a Louis Blériot medal, to be awarded to record setters in speed, altitude or distance in light aircraft, was also announced."

The two perpetrators were caught after a quick investigation and confessed to the murder, justifying their actions by saying the mufti had acted against the Islamic faith and was little more than a puppet of the infidels. Appointed by the colonial authorities first as imam then as a mufti, unpopular and frequently brazenly critical of even mild reformist talk, Bendali had many powerful enemies. After a rough interrogation session, the murderer confessed to being merely a pawn in a greater scheme, offered thousands of francs to kill the imam by the true mastermind behind the crime: a prominent member of the reformist Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, Tayeb el-Okbi. Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the state under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many Algerians and some Frenchmen believe this is a conspiracy, and that el-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment. We could drop charges against el-Okbi, somewhat losing face but preventing any further unrest and possibly gaining an ally within the Association, or we could keep him in jail, getting rid of a prominent indigène leader and sowing dissent among the ulemas."

This time the actor plays Fernand, a hen-pecked husband who, after getting knocked out, wakes up in a caravan heading towards the Algerian interior, his identity papers stolen and replaced by new ones: he is now another man, a new volunteer in the French Foreign Legion. Incapable of explaining his situation to his officer, Fernand is called to fight some unruly tribe deep in the Sahara desert, and despite early mishaps, he quickly finds military life much more enjoyable than his marriage, and especially much less disciplined. Now truly a whole new man, he is eventually tracked down by his wife but instead chooses to re-enlist under his real name, becoming a veritable hero and eventually being awarded the Legion of honour.The humorous tale has proven particularly popular among veterans."

Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners, sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering \"All is Grace\".\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticizing clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this \"Diary\", a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."

Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, played by Balin, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to \"slum it\" among natives and emigrants in the sensual and dangerous world of the Casbah.

This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it’s hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic.

Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, a sense of belonging, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell’s books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys around seven years old, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford. However, these groups have remained largely isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts that would permit greater cooperation and uniformisation of scouting practices among the indigènes. Already, prominent native voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along with loyalty to France, while some more conservative pieds-noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the patrie they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria.

nfa.421.d:0 "The Companions of Joan of Arc is an association honouring the memory of the patron saint of France, canonized in 1920 in the aftermath of the revolution. Founded in 1930 by Maxime Real del Sarte, an artist close to the Action Française, after the man organised for a relic of the saint to be smuggled out of the Commune, the association describes itself as apolitical, simply stating that it seeks to \"bring together all those of goodwill around she who saved France in her hour of need and who so perfectly embodies our aspirations for the freedom of our nation\". And indeed each year the patriotic celebrations organised around the shrine built for the relic are more and more popular, with tens of thousands in attendance for a day culminating in an open-air mass, including numerous parliamentarians, officials, bishops, intellectuals, veterans, and officers, and this year even [NFA.GetLeader] himself.\n\nHowever despite the association claiming that it seeks to remain apolitical, and the \"Pucelle\" being revered by most of the political spectrum, many seek to use the event to further their political agenda. Both the Action Française and the Parti Social Français have repeatedly been caught distributing leaflets, supporters of the two parties sometimes even coming to blows. However, these minor incidents have not hampered the general enthusiasm for the celebrations, and the Companions expect even more attendance next year."

nfa.422.d:0 "\"To the Spanish Martyrs\" is a poem by dramatist and diplomat Paul Claudel, a deeply conservative, devout Catholic, a long-time critic of the anticlerical Third Republic, who became a sort of official poet of the Pétain regime, his long religious plays earning him unending praise and even a Nobel prize nomination. However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of red terror, profanations, and acts of syndicalist violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil. Committees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, \"Aux Martyrs Espagnols\" calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs: it has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."

nfa.423.d:0 "Football was introduced in North Africa by the French: amateur clubs made up of colonists and garrisoned soldiers formed as early as the 1890s, with the Oran Athletic Club claiming to be the oldest football club in not just Algeria, but all of Africa. Slowly, indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become an incredibly popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club’s goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."

nfa.424.d:0 "\"The Grand Illusion\", a war film featuring an all-star cast, is quickly becoming the most successful and controversial movie of the last few years. Set in a German prison camp during the Great War, the movie follows three French officers, one of working-class background, an aristocrat, and a nouveau riche naturalised Polish Jew and their efforts to escape captivity. Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the war is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling a wide variety of themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the war ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House. In any case, it has become an instant classic."

nfa.425.d:0 "Since 1861, the principality of Monaco has had close relations with France: nominally independent, the tiny state heavily relied on France and most of its flourishing economy depended on French money, invested or lost in Monte Carlo’s casinos, the two neighbours eventually agreeing to sign a treaty of \"protective friendship\". Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution brewing in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat’s hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of \"Soldier-Prince\" and a promotion to the rank of general. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco’s national day falling on the Prince’s patron saint’s feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France’s political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince’s palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."

nfa.426.d:0 "Pierre de Coubertin, born in 1863, historian, educator, journalist, founder of the International Olympic Committee, has died of a heart attack at 74 years old. Born in a royalist family but rallied to the Republic, he turned down the opportunity of a military career and instead dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting the integration of physical activity in education. But de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and for them to become an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Panhellenic games, and the first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics couldn’t prevent the madness of the Great War, and following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Already heartbroken by the death at the front of two nephews, the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics, that neither Frances attended, and the subsequent establishment of the Spartakiades, left de Coubertin a broken shell of a man, his dream crumbling before his eyes. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."

Viticulture in a region that is populated in the vast majority by alcohol-abstinent Muslims might seem peculiar, but Algeria is well suited for growing grapes, with it’s warm, sunny climate. Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony. Since the exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the métropole."

In this essay, the heir traces back the origins of the poor working and living conditions of the proletariat to the Revolution of 1789, a \"bourgeois coup\" that he claims turned the proud artisans and farmers of old into proletarians by destroying traditional structures such as guilds and enabling economic liberalism. He chronicles the slow descent into indignity of the working classes over the last century and a half, caused by usurious industrial capitalism and new illegitimate elites, culminating in the 1919 revolution, an event that he considers engineered by nefarious forces exploiting the legitimate grievances of the masses. Prince Henri then makes a passionate case for the monarchy, the only regime he claims could truly restore the dignity of the people by upholding tradition and the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThe work was well-received and sold well, thanks to tireless promotion by the Action Française and praise by influential clergy, already being translated in multiple languages and published abroad, though some were shocked by the violence of Henri’s denunciation of capitalism and the bourgeoisie. Curiously it has even received praise, sometimes genuine but mostly amused, from the Commune."

Much of its collections are recent acquisitions: indeed, the government-funded extensive ethnographic expeditions in our present and former colonial possessions in an effort to consolidate our hold on outlying territories. The 1931 Dakar-Djibouti Mission alone, for example, made up of linguists, ethnographers, naturalists, painters, photographers and even a musicologist, brought back more than 3000 objects, 6000 photographs, 1600 meters of photographic film, and 1500 pages of notes documenting invaluable information on a rapidly disappearing way of life.\n\nThough there has been criticism over the manner of acquisition of its collections, some radical newspapers even going as far as making accusations of racket, the opening ceremony of the museum was a success, attended by the mayor of Algiers, the minister of the colonies and thousands of curious Algérois, pieds-noirs and indigènes alike."

nfa.430.d:0 "Directed by the controversial and successful Abel Gance, a pioneer of film-making well known for his historical dramas, as well as his ingenious editing and special effects technique. 20 years in the making, \"I accuse\" is a peculiar war story taking French cinemas by storm, telling the story of love rivals turned friends on the battlefields of the Great War, before the futile death of one, and the slow descent into shell-shocked insanity of the other. But it is the ending that has most divided the opinion, as the crazed man who had vowed to end all wars, temporarily relapses into sanity to find that the world is getting ready for a new great conflict. He springs into action, and in a supernatural storm calls on the millions of dead of the Weltkrieg, regardless of their nationality, to rise from their grave and punish the living for their foolish obsession with mutual destruction. All over Europe, the dead of all countries hear his call, unite and march on, creating mass panic and preventing another war.\n\nAccused of pacifism, of sullying the memory of our war heroes by some, praised for his skill by others, Gance escaped censorship due to his links with veterans associations: indeed, many veterans were employed during the filming of the movie, and in particular many \"gueules-cassées\", broken faces, for the great finale. The dead might not rise and march on to prevent a Second Weltkrieg, but those disfigured by the last war want to have their voices heard as war frenzy in our nation rages on."

Tenacious, quick, and with incredible precision, some see in him immense potential, despite his one real weakness: fragile hands, earning him his other nickname, \"The Man with Clay Hands\".\n\nBorn in a poor pieds-noirs family of Spanish origins, speaking French, Arabic, and Spanish, having left school at 11, drifting from job to job until his father realised his true worth as a boxer, Marcel’s success story has turned him into a popular icon. No matter the community, Arabs, immigrants, pieds-noirs, exiles, the public sees him as a true self-made man, coming from nothing and yet climbing ever higher through sheer effort and strength of character. His national title well earned, he is now looking into joining the European fray: the whole nation will follow with great interest his career from now on, cheering him on, perhaps even all the way to a world champion title."

Though still small, the community hopes to attract more members seeking a life of work, prayer, and service to the natives, with whom relations have so far been peaceful.\n\nFar from being the only monastic community in a similar situation, Catholic media and hierarchy have nonetheless praised this latest example of religious coexistence, while others see the abbey as a shining example of the civilising mission of France in her colonies. However, some have expressed worry: the community is far from the centres of colonial life and most importantly their garrisons. But the monks have assured that they have nothing to fear from their neighbours and that they are in any case under the protection of the Virgin Mary, to whom they have erected a great statue overlooking the valley."

Born during the Weltkrieg to a failed singer and a street acrobat, raised in a brothel for most of her childhood in the torment of revolution, she was nonetheless blessed with an incredible voice, her harsh life has given her a haunting depth and sensibility. Having started her career as a street singer, she quickly started performing in cabarets and workers’ clubs, singing about working-class life and struggles. Soon, she was on the radio, and inevitably her songs would cross the sea and the embargo. Her records are played in the packed clubs of Algiers, as Frenchmen let the nostalgia of their homeland be soothed by Piaf’s striking Parisian accent and tales of the atmosphere of the shady parts of the City of Lights.\n\nSome find her songs scandalous, while others insist these songs are coated in syndicalist propaganda, but the government is doing nothing to stop the spread of her records and it is rumoured that she has admirers in high places. Amusingly, she has proved equally controversial in the Commune: there, she has been accused of encouraging bourgeois degeneracy and singing counter-revolutionary propaganda about the living conditions of the proletariat, though thankfully these complaints fall on equally deaf ears."

By the author’s admission, however, the plot of the book is largely there to serve its historical and ethnographic qualities. Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation \"to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser\", proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from “civilized” people and that they too have a long and rich history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself Dahomean. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing a generally pro-French sentiment but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction. This decision which could have proved controversial has instead been generally met with praise from much of colonial society, though for varying reasons: where some évolués see proof, if one was ever needed, of the intellectual equality of the Black man, some in the colonial government see proof of the success of the civilising mission."

Their relationship is cordial and polite enough, though understandably chilly due to geopolitical considerations, but a fight breaking out between sailors of the different crews prevents any further fraternisation. However, an incident brings them together: arms traffickers are spotted leaving the harbour, and in their flight have released poison gas. The deadly cloud is slowly drifting towards a passenger ship, and the men put aside their differences to save the civilians, going straight through the gas with little protection: the civilians are rescued and the traffickers stopped. Despite their heroism, all the crews lose some men, including the Red British officer, and they are all buried with full military honours.\n\nDirected by the profoundly Catholic director Léo Joannon, filmed at sea with the help of our navy, on real ships and with real sailors as extras, the movie was hit with criticism from some who found distasteful the positive image of the German and British characters, going as far as taxing the movie of pacifism. Against such critics, the director argued that the core message of the picture is one of Christian fraternity, bravery and camaraderie in the face of adversity, despite eternally rising international tensions."

This measure was necessary to coordinate the various actions taken by opponents to the syndicalist regime such as the distribution of tracts, preparations to hamper the war effort, recruitment, bribery, or discrete weapon training as tensions ramp up a bit more each day.

From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental Religions and Metaphysical Systems. However, following the defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-Materialist tracts and published "The Crisis of the Modern World" in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, “Oriental Metaphysics” is a detailed exploration of Oriental Metaphysical Systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the Liberal worldview of their recent past in favour of a Traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences.

The letter, calling for the formation of a “Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims” to “pray for our estranged brothers” was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Morrocan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to “study the enemy”, a year later he would convert, two and he joined the Fransciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."

A man calling himself “François-Henry Prométhée” has been organising politico-mystical gatherings, attracting a growing number of curious onlookers, with some even turning into believers in the strange creed of this fiery “Prometheus”. The man declares he is “the Master” of a political movement called “Le Feu”, the Fire, the “New Man” who has “come to restore Hope in the hearts of all Frenchmen”. From a stage adorned in banners featuring the party-cult’s symbols, the phoenix, a wheel and thunder, he leads the ever growing crowds in repetitive chants, such as:\n\n'Through our Fire, She will be reborn\nHer Faith will be perpetual\nHer Genius will shine\nFrance will be Eternal'.\n\nSince the man’s political platform seemingly does not go into more depth than these charismatic if deranged rants, nothing was done at first by the authorities. As the crowds grew however, a cursory investigation was initiated by our intelligence services. Shockingly, they found that this “François-Henry Prométhée” has never existed, and is merely the pseudonym of Maurice Delaunay, a farmer from Normandy, who after brilliant studies at the National Institute for Horticulture and a brief stint in politics has seemingly lost his mind. More worrying however, is the important funding the man receives from unknown sources: some within the Bureau suspect Communard influence.\nWhat should be done?"

Worse, despite the ban on such activities, many of our compatriots tune into Communard radio every day during the month of July to follow the progress of the race, with cafés turning into listening parties and law enforcement being awfully lenient, often even discreetly listening to the results themselves. Something had to be done to prevent red propaganda being directly broadcasted to our people in that way, and this year was finally created a Tour d’Algérie. Going through most major towns of the Algerian littoral, such as Orléanville, Oran, Bone, starting and ending in Algier, with even a detour through Tunisia, the race was a massive popular success, giving bicycle racing fans the euphoria of a national sporting competitions they had seeked for close to two decades by now. And with a win by French cyclist Roger Lapébie boosting national pride, we have every reason to make this competition a yearly event, despite the whispers of killjoys that we might be 'settling in exile'."

A strange sight for the officer in charge of processing his application, more used to foreign men of dubious pasts, willing to serve and die for France for a chance at a new life. He gave Henri Robert Orliac as his name, and the officer did not care if that was the truth. Like so many others in these bellicose days, Orliac was then integrated in the troop, once in a simple recruit uniform only somewhat standing out from his peers.\nTruth is, Henri was not an ordinary recruit: his real name is Henri d'Orléans, royal prince of the House of France. In the Great War, his father too had attempted to join the Foreign Legion but was denied from it due the Law of Exile barring representatives of the former reigning houses from setting foot in France. But young Henri, eager to serve France in this great crusade against socialism, could not be deterred from doing his duty. One day, perhaps the prince will be called to rule over the nation, but for now he will serve the nation in other ways."

Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois. \nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto. All clad in their green-trimmed formal attire, complete with personalised ornate swords and bicornes, the 473 members of the Institute have signed a common appeal to the world to undermine the efforts of these 'perverts' and 'bohemians', and penned a manifesto in which they call for the creation of a international 'Institute of Occident' to fight the 'vanguard of inculture'. This initiative has received wide acclaim in France and among our Entente allies, as well as from the German sphere. \nAs for the International Avant-Garde, it responded by setting up an abstract statue representing 'bourgeois culture' and 'classicism' made out of copies of the manifesto in front of the former location of the Institut de France, in Paris. As the inauguration ceremony was underway, it was set ablaze by known lunatic Georges Bataille, a move that was applauded as an example of 'pure artistic spontaneity' by the organisation."

The left would insist that this is a day celebrating the 1789 storming of the Bastille fortress, a Parisian royal prison and armory, widely considered as the starting point of the French Revolution, while the right would on the contrary consider that this is a day commemorating the Fête de la Fédération, a massive holiday festival that took place across France a year later to celebrate the unity of the French nation, and an end of the political struggle, of the Revolution itself. History proved that hope wrong, but this hasn’t stopped this debate from arising every year. The 1880 law instituting the National Day on the 14th of July simply abstains from taking a side, but thankfully we have since put the controversy to rest, as an amendment voted by the Assembly some years ago has clarified that we are indeed commemorating the Festival of the Federation today."

nfa.507.d:0 "The 'Association des oulémas musulmans algériens' or Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema is a religious association founded in 1933. Under the unofficial leadership of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, this association of theologians, teachers and more generally learned men has come to promote Islamic reform, hoping to bring Islam in Algeria to its pure original form, away from the superstitions fostered by the marabouts and the more mystical approach of the Sufi congregations. Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, skeptical of both the sincerity of the AF’s promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Communards."

Some dare to whisper that the Comité is merely a front for a renewed dictatorship under Mordacq, and already some intellectuals and politicians openly criticise the General. However, one thing that was restored immediately after the fall of Pétain is freedom of expression: these men have the right to speak their mind, no matter how wrong they are, and how potentially destabilising this kind of talk is.\n\nWe could simply let it go and hope the debate runs its course, or we could take a more proactive approach. One possibility would be using legal means to silence these critics, by accusing them of defamation: juries would no doubt rule in our favor and force these men to publicly recant."

Finally free from censorship, it seems journalists are relishing in this effort to tear down the man who restored freedom of expression. The government has so far ignored the situation, but letting this criticism go unanswered much longer could durably undermine the new regime and jeopardise our efforts to save the nation. Of course restoring censorship would be unthinkable, but there exist legal means to stifle this flow of defamation. However, we could also take a softer approach: by setting up regular press conferences broadcast to our people, the president of the Comité could directly address criticism and clear any doubt anyone might have about his allegiance to the Republic, to democracy."

Sadly, most of those concerned dismissed this invite, and as such it became necessary to use legal means to stop their seditious activities. Invoking the 1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press, they were accused of inciting 'offences against the public interest', and were put on trial. \nThis, however, backfired. Not only this made the Comité de Salut National look tyrannical, and made the criticism look founded, but it was utterly ineffective. The trials were turned into platforms for these men to criticise the new political order, arguing that it was at best another flavor of tyranny, and that this effort to stifle their right to freedom of expression went against the very ideals that led them to fight against the Pétain regime. Most were acquitted, other received at most small fines. It seems that in the future the Bear will have to contend with the liberties he supposedly fought to restore."

When the Bear entered the room, in full uniform, his numerous medals, awarded for his long years of service to France, glistening in the spotlight, the room fell silent, as the men who had spoken so much against him were too intimidated by the now almost legendary general to open their mouths. It took a particularly brave foreign journalist to ask the one question on everyone’s mind: 'General, will you uphold the fundamental liberties of Frenchmen?'\n\nAnd finally, Mordacq spoke. 'It is true that we live in extraordinary times, and as such extraordinary measures are necessary. This is no longer the time for discussion but the time of action, and action, true action, action that produces results, requires a single will. We must unite if we want to win, and we must win for the salvation of France. However, and this has always been my promise to our people, these measures are indeed extraordinary and will not be maintained for more than they are necessary. Democracy has always been the hope of not only France, but all of Europe, I simply ask my fellow Frenchmen to trust the Comité and myself to lead them to victory. It will not be easy, but internal dissensions would make it impossible: fundamental liberties have been restored, and I ask you to use them wisely, for the sake of our patrie.'"

The ceremony was carefully organised to follow as closely as possible the millennium old protocol, despite taking place in the Saint-Philippe cathedral of Algiers instead of the traditional coronation in Reims, which current circumstances would make difficult to organise. Much of the necessary ceremonial items, like the sword Joyeuse, said to have been the sword of Charlemagne, as well as the Holy Ampulla, glass vial holding anointing oil said to have been given by the Holy Spirit for the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, had been evacuated during the retreat from the mainland and new regalia was crafted by skilled artisans, particularly an ornate crown.\n\nAfter swearing oaths on the Scriptures to defend the Church, maintain peace, fight injustice, be merciful and just, as well as fight heresy, Jean d’Orléans was anointed in nine spots in the shape of a cross with holy oil by the archbishop of Algiers, then was draped in a blue cloak sprinkled with gold fleurs-de-lys, given the scepter and the hand of justice, and, finally, crowned. Peers of the reborn kingdom swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said. This done, the king and the royal family headed out for their new residence, the former presidential palace in the heights of Algiers, cheered on the whole way there by a numerous crowd, public celebrations and banquets taking place well into the late hours of the night. Some important details were altered in the ceremony, however: the king did not swear the traditional oath to fight infidels and was instead given by the mufti of Algiers a traditional flyssa sword representing his new status of Hāmī al-Islām or Protector of Islam, and among the peers swearing fidelity to His Majesty were numerous Arab, Berber or African chiefs in their traditional costumes, symbol of a new era of French rule."

nfa.513.t:0 "Women's Suffrage"
nfa.513.d:0 "The issue of women’s suffrage has been a contentious one in French politics for a long while. At the revolution, women were considered “passive citizens”, a category shared with children and domestics: in other words citizens who were inherently under the influence of another and as such could not be trusted with the right to vote. In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality. Idem when a Third Republic was declared in 1870. Though they were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women’s suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women’s suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband’s will, or worse,\n the Church’s.Charles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."

But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d’Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armored: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."

The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regnum Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place.

The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

Though a part of the population had initially welcomed the annexation, it quickly became clear that without independence, gambling or tourism, the former principality was little more than a backwards if pretty little town and opinion towards the Communards quickly soured. A treaty was signed later in the day with French representatives, deepening the mutual commitment of the two states towards each other already established by the 1918 treaty of 'protective friendship', and ensuring that the fate of France and Monaco would from now on forever be linked."

Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centers of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the “City of Bridges”. As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the pieds-noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of independentist talk."

With German cash, given under the pretenses of funding study of the Genisteae flower in the hills of the Vosges region, Commandant Martial quickly built a disciplined network gathering information on Communard infrastructure and troop movements in the East, implementing weapons and explosives caches all over the Vosges and in Alsace, creating armed networks in Lorraine as well as stay-behind groups should the Commune advance past the Vosges.

nfa.522.d:0 "In 1897, German Foreign Secretary von Bülow had argued that the colonial policy of the Empire was simply “to throw no one into the shade, but to get our own place in the sun”. Despite these conciliatory words, for close to two decades they enviously observed as we spread French civilisation and built a globe-spanning empire. More than once, we rebuked their attempts at expansion: they made us pay this dearly. Utterly defeated in Africa, their subjects breathing a sigh of relief as the Teuton yoke was finally lifted, we were nevertheless forced to concede to Germany much of our colonies as part of the conditions of the 1919 Armistice. We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favorable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, behemothic patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar es Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé von Göring as head of the chimeric \"Deutsch-Mittelafrika\", the overambitious Flying Ogre only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered. We will bide our time, observing and contacting our former native allies: perhaps sooner rather than later they will come back under our influence."

nfa.523.d:0 "Surrounded by his female guards the Mino, better known to Westerners as the Amazons, clad in his finest traditional attire and wielding his “récade”, the axe-shaped royal scepter, the elderly King of Dahomey welcomed in his palace of Abomey our envoy, who lavished him with gifts, praise, and with one demand: to reestablish the treaty of friendship and commerce that had united our two nations since 1894. The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly reestablish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources. But this is a joyous day: French diplomacy has secured us the first step towards the reconquest of our African empire."

Taken over and restored after the conquest of Algeria, the fort was until recently a secondary garrison. However the sleepy citadel has been bustling with activity for the last few months: a school was created there by the regime to educate the future elites of the nation.\n\nUnder the leadership of Lieutenant Pierre Dunoyer de Segonzac, a young and fiery officer, and René de Naurois, a military chaplain beloved by his men, the National School of Cadres of Oran has created an innovative six-months curriculum to shape hundreds of the brightest youths of the nation into leaders worthy of serving France. With strict discipline, exemplary morality, strenuous physical exercise inspired by scoutism and military training, long hours of study and a deep sense of camaraderie, Lieutenant Dunoyer de Segonzac hopes to create a New Man entirely dedicated to national interests. Interestingly the students in their retreat between sea and sky have begun to shape the “spirit” of the School themselves: nicknaming Dunoyer de Segonzac “Old Chief”, though the man is barely thirty, they have styled themselves as a knightly order, with a motto and coat of arms, swearing an oath to France and their comrades. A development embraced by the direction of the School as the romantic image of the school brings ever more volunteers.\n\nHowever, Sainte-Croix’s independence is worrying some within government while others consider the school to be slowly but surely into a personality cult around the “Old Chief”, if not a cult plain and simple given the increasingly mystical Catholic devotion fostered by Padre de Naurois.

For years open expression of the Faith was forbidden, bishops were run out of the country, some churches were seized, homilies were monitored. In the sillage of our victorious armies some dared to join our forces’ open air masses, priests who had gone into hiding reclaimed their parishes, while some still skittish, perhaps fearing a red counter-offensive, only discreetly brought flowers to the few roadside shrines which had managed to escape the purge of religious expression from public space. With the fratricide conflict coming to an end, the once silenced bells rang all over the nation, great  processions were organised to purify towns and villages from the stain left by both atheistic anticlericalism and the orgy of violence, crosses were put back up, long lines formed at the confessional, pews filled up, pilgrimage sites teemed with life as survivors came to bring their thanks to whichever saint they prayed to for protection in battle or as bombs fell indiscriminately: Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, of Lourdes, of La Salette, Saint Thérèse, Saint Geneviève, Saint Jeanne d’Arc, all had their new devotees. \n\nThe Communards had attempted to stamp out the 'opium of the people': clearly, this was not as successful as they had hoped.

Truth is, they didn’t need any explanation: a simple picture was sufficient, a picture that would be in every newspaper the very next day.\n\nWith a total area of 200 cm2, described as 'small and devastating', named after the now infamous Red project for an atom bomb by the genius inventor who hoped it would create an “explosive commercial and cultural reaction”, the damocles, now the world’s smallest swimsuit, is creating of wave of passion across Europe and beyond. Réard has already received thousands of fan letters, strangely enough mainly from men, and just as many orders, but many are not amused by this new fashion statement.

However, with a lack of funds allocated for the conservation of the Palace of the Popes under Communard rule and some sizable damage occurred during the reconquest, the city has seen better days. \n\nAs such, to gather funds for the reconstruction of the medieval quarter, the city with support from the government has created a week-long art festival, focused primarily on theater, the palace making for a prestigious open-air stage. Expecting the visit of a few locals, the city was instead overwhelmed by the attendance: thousands showed up to see plays such as Shakespeare’s “Richard II” or “The Story of Tobit and Sarah”, a biblical tale by devout Catholic diplomat and poet Paul Claudel. After such a success, the city has vowed to make this festival a yearly event, with all the proceeds going to the conservation and reconstruction efforts.

The Great War put these plans into motions: what better way to show respect and gratitude to the many Muslim colonial subjects fighting for the Motherland?

The Tour’s precise itinerary was different every year, and having the event pass through one’s town or village was certainly the event of the summer. The revolution did not hamper the enthusiasm of France for the Tour, though the number of foreign participants starkly dropped. Indeed, cycle sports were even encouraged by the Communard authorities as a proletarian alternative to motorsports, much like football was promoted over rugby. Even in exile, our people listened intently to the Tour on the radio, leading to the creation of a rival Tour d’Algérie which did find much success, though it never stopped our people from illegally tuning in to red radio stations to follow the competition.\n\nWith the mainland reconquered however, it is time to organise once again the Tour de France, hopefully bringing, if only briefly, our still deeply divided people together. However, within the committee tasked with determining the itinerary a question arose: should this Tour also pass through Algeria? After all, the Algerian departments are a part of France like any other. Medical experts have warned that this would turn the competition into an almost two-months long affair and that the sweltering heat of the Maghrebi summers could make more than one cyclist collapse, but the symbolic triumph of a unified tour could certainly make this risk worth it."

Many of our Catholic citizens believe that the churches should be rebuilt as they were, a way to exorcise the godless past, however this would have a certain cost, especially when the money could be redirected to more urgent causes. Alternatively, we can rebuild some of them while giving them another purpose, like housing concert venues or public libraries.

However, one heap of slowly rusting metal is turning into a playground for local children and attracting the curiosity of a few onlookers: a disabled heavy British tank in particularly good shape, once a lynchpin of the local Syndicalist defense, stuck in a ditch right outside Vimoutiers. \n\nOf course, the authorities attempted to seize the tank as part of the country-wide effort to heal the scars of the war, either to scrap it for parts and metal or study it further. But the Vimonastériens refused, even chasing away one cleanup crew: children cried at the thought of losing their playground, while the adults had grown strangely attached to the wreck. Of course the near pristine state of the tank has spurned numerous jokes about the bravery of the British troops but mostly the locals seem fascinated by the object, its newfound peaceful quietness perhaps a symbol of the slow return to normalcy across France.

Following the fall of the Eternal City, these volunteers immediately headed to France to fight bravely in the Franco-Prussian War. These devout Catholics, many of them royalists, headed by Baron Athanase de Charette de La Contrie, descendant of a famous leader of the Vendée insurrection, nevertheless set aside their differences with the Republic to fight against the Prussian aggressor. Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading “Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France” was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit.

It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honor, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty. The Republic in her foolish civilising mission had sought to turn the Indigène into a Frenchman.

Once the rulers of the island from where they embarked on numerous raids against Barbary pirates, a true fighting force made up of the noblest warriors of Christendom, the Knights were defeated by the armies of the impostor Bonaparte. Malta annexed, its possessions seized, the Order was exiled and dispersed. The Hospitallers instead chose to focus on their original mission, caring for the poor and sick. With one exception: an elite auxiliary military corps, mostly dedicated to medical functions, serving with the Italian army. But united Italy is no more and therein lies the agreement the Knights are offering us. In exchange of rather limited concessions, for example granting extraterritoriality to some locations historically associated with the Order, the Knights are offering to reform their auxiliary force to serve under the French flag, assisting us in our crusade to free the Métropole. Of course this would mean taking liberties with a British colony, something our friends would not appreciate, and the actual benefits to us would largely consist in a propaganda opportunity, though the expertise of the Order is undeniable.

Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies. \n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany.

Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu’min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfill this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire. \n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."

Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest  has taken to the radio to call for an “insurrection of Goodness”. Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised “Emmaüs” welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national preeminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shockwave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and “Abbé Henri” as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of a Emmaüs charity network are already underway.

It holds the legacy of the most powerful kingdom in the region before French colonization, which spread its power far beyond its capital of Ouagadougou to neighbouring kingdoms. However, other kingdoms such as Tenkodogo, Fada N'Gourma, Boussouma or Ouahigouya still exist along with their kings and continue to vie for influence in Haute-Volta. \nIn this context, a dispute recently arose between the Moogo Naaba and the other kingdoms. Indeed, Naba Koom II praised the work of the native ethnologist Antoine Dim Delobsom "The Empire of the Mogho-Naba" (L'empire du Mogho-Naba). The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies. However, the book also spreads a view of the country as being almost complied to bow under the Moogo Naaba, feeding and legitimating the still very existent ambitions of Naba Koom II to make the Mossi kingdom the dominant power in Haute-Volta. This display of ambitions didn't sit well with the other kings, wary of the Moogo Naaba playing between the interests of the French colonists and those of the population to assert the power of the Mossi once again. \nRepresentatives of each kingdom came in a delegation to the seat of the colonial governor in Ouagadougou to compell him to take a stand of the matter.

A brief but intense exchange of gunfire between the rebels and other nearby units in the garrison ended with a victory for the French troops but the morale has hit a new low with the ease at which the rebels managed to gain entrance into the facility. This attack is likely to embolden further resistance in the territory over the course of the next few weeks."

nfa.449.d:0 "Around 5 in the morning last night, an explosion woke up locals near the rail line. Urgent messages were sent up the line to stop any further trains from heading down the rails just in case. With the sun just peeking over the horizon, the nearby garrison arrived on the scene to figure out what happened. The light touched down on what remained of several gazelles and a few pieces of a tripwire mechanism meant to fire once a train passed overhead. It seems whoever had done this was hunting larger prey."

nfa.450.d.funnyfootball:0 "A game of football attracted some of the bored soldiers in one of our forts in French Sudan. The locals were playing outside the fort and a stray kick sent the ball flying through the open front gates. Every player chased that ball inside the fort and before the soldiers had time to process what was happening, natives had seized weapons and held the fort hostage at the force of arms. Raising an improvised flag over the ramparts, our men were chased out of town without their boots. After they had run for several kilometres, they encountered an armoured car patrol that they were able to flag down. With the help of the patrol, the men of the garrison were able to fight back and recapture the fort. Martial law has been placed in effect for the next months and recreational games are to be held no less than 500 metres from the garrison."
nfa.450.d.generic:0 "'Fort under attack! Fort under attack!' Such is the telegram that was received at the colonial headquarters of Bamako. A fort manned by a French garrison was under attack by rebellious natives again. The headquarters sent a force with armored cars to stop the attack and repel the rebels. Fortunately, the rebels flew quickly upon seeing the rescuing force and the fort has seen little damage, but still a few our men fell and the attack sent a strong message to other natives of the area. We will have to be careful."

nfa.451.d:0 "After 2 months, trains can now freely travel along the Dakar-Niger Railway.

However, not every striker has returned to work. A significant number have left and are assumed to be working with local resistance groups in the region. We can expect more trouble in the near future from them."

nfa.453.t:0 "Bedouin raid"
nfa.453.d:0 "Raiding is the way of life for the Bedouin people. Their largely nomadic lifestyle prohibits them from settling down somewhere habitable and farming to provide for themselves. The harsh climate of the Sahara also offers little in the way of life which only reinforces their need to raid our settlements. Recently, a group of villagers from Mauritania have petitioned our aid in defending their settlement against the raiders. Once or twice a year, the Bedouin ride out of the desert, ransack the town, and ride off usually with several grazing animals to take for food."

The few panicked survivors first tried to hide from our unit but after one of our native soldiers took off his cap and set aside his rifle, one of the survivors managed to get over his fear and tell a horrible story about the camel riders of the east who swarmed in to take prisoners off as slaves. Anyone who resisted did not see much fruit for their labours. Another soldier calls out that he can make out a faint trail moving east but a sandstorm appears to be moving up from the south..."

The ferocious winds and howling sands made any movement perilous as our vehicles were just as likely to crash into each other as make any forward progress. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, they seem to have gotten away..."

nfa.456.t:0 "Slave Caravan Captured"
nfa.456.d:0 "The story has reached the headlines across the nation! Our brave soldiers coming across the grisly scene at the village but steeling themselves for a desert chase. Flying across the desert, racing against time as a sandstorm steadily approached their position, the patrol eventually managed to find the caravan as it fled across the desert. Outgunned but not without heart, the tribal raiders fought viciously but our boys prevailed in their righteous fight! One of the raiders was captured alive and divulged the location of the place where he was to meet another raider party before turning in to the Sahara.\n\nAfter seeing to the wounded from the burnt village, our patrol drove north and managed to set up an ambush upon the second caravan. Altogether, over 40 slaves were saved from captivity and have begun to spread the tale of their liberators' bravery in protecting them. This is sure to bring goodwill to our government from the local people."

nfa.458.d:0 "The Confédération Générale des Travailleurs Tunisiens (General Confederation of the Tunisians Workers) was founded in the 1920's by Mohamed Ali El Hammi, a noted sympathizer of the Syndicalists beyond the sea. We of course quickly put him out at the time and forbade the CGTT, but it didn't stop it from existing underground. The union always was close from the Tunisian nationalists of the Destour party, and the two underground organisations often work together. This time, they worked to foment a strike amongst the Tunis dockers and in several factories in the south of Tunisia and in Tunis. \nIf syndicalist propaganda wasn't already threatening enough, the strikes have also put to the forefront a word of independence for Tunisia. An absurdity of course, but one these workers seem to believe in. In any way, it's going to be the time for a bit of cleaning in the dockers of the port of Tunis, and if the strikers won't disperse themselves, we will have to send the army."

nfa.459.t:0 "Moncef Bey Rumoured To Help Tunisian Nationalists"
nfa.459.d:0 "Our secret police threw a concerning report on the desk of the French general resident in Tunisia. The document tells about known Tunisian nationalists entering the Beylical palace in which the prince Moncef Bey resides. These members of the nationalist Destour party aren't the most important ones - they aren't Habib Bourguiba or Abdelaziz Thaalbi - but most of them are suspected of treason. They come in and leave the palace discreetly and transporting nothing but there is no doubt the Bey is transmitting them important pieces of information. Moncef Bey is the son of one of the previous honourary monarch of the protectorate of Tunisia, Naceur Bey, and is the grand-nephew of the current ruling Bey, Ahmed II. He has always been remarked for his opposition to the French regime and he doesn't hide too much his likening for the Tunisian nationalists.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning considering Moncef is the next on the line of succession to the statute of Bey after Ahmed II. Whatever he is actually doing to help these terrorists, an opponent can't be tolerated this close to power. With our important military presence, an intervention to 'secure' the Bey shouldn't meet a lot of resistance."

nfa.460.d:0 "'Kaboom!' resonating as if the Communards had just bombed the city, the detonation woke up a lot of inhabitants of the suburbs of the city. Terrorists had planted a bomb on the railway line passing by to Tunis. This line is instrumental to the supply of the region and even though the reparation won't take too long, the message sent stays clear: in case of war the terrorists could cut our supply lines with a simple explosion."

nfa.461.d:0 "'We won't fight for the Frenchmen! Tunisians only fight for themselves!'\n\nThis was one of the sentences written on leaflets found everywhere in the popular districts of Tunis. It seems that the underground nationalist Destour party has once again swarmed workplaces and markets with their harmful propaganda. We will remove these leaflets as usual and as soon as possible to prevent these ideas of spreading more."

nfa.463.t:0 "The North African Star - A Rousing Speech!"
nfa.463.d:0 "A small crowd started to gather on a square of Algiers at 6:00PM this evening. After only 20 minutes the crowd, visibly getting larger by the minute, was already spreading to all of the small streets around the square accompanied by a tumultuous clamour. At the center of the gathering was a young Algerian militant. Even if only in his 20's, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observants were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Etoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land. \nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd. This incident can't be ignored, and can't be taken lightly. It is representative of the strategy of the ENA to spread its ideas and supplies to a talented younger generation of militants in Algeria for them to start the fight for independence in Africa with support from the French Commune. While their attempted struggle is far from being over, it isn't a reason to be lenient. We must take care to not let any comparable event happen again."
nfa.463.a:0 "The speech wasn't well-written anyway"

nfa.464.t:0 "A Street Fight Between Algerian Nationalists"
nfa.464.d:0 "Early last night, violence suddenly arose in streets of Constantine. The police report stated that some militants of the Action Algérienne party quite randomly encountered members of the underground ENA while they were seated at a small restaurant. The details of the start of the fight are then unclear but all versions agree to say the street turned into utter chaos in a few minutes while members of the two parties fought, threw chairs, tables, and any projectile they could find all while insulting each other in French and Arabic. The fight finally stopped when rumours were heard of coming police.\n\nThis fight of a minor importance reveals the increasing tensions between the two main Algerian nationalist parties. The ENA is a syndicalist party, founded in Paris by Messali Hadj, forbidden in Algeria and radically opposed to the current French rule. The Action Algérienne however is legal and its leader, Fehrat Abbas believes in assimilationism into a Greater France and calls for a greater traditional autonomy. The Action Algérienne is based on the ideas of the Action Française, adapting integralism to an Algerian context.\n\nIn the end, whatever the actual differences are, the good news is that they all hate each other."
nfa.464.a:0 "Ha, at least they fight amongst themselves"

nfa.465.t:0 "A Shipment From the Commune Captured"
nfa.465.d:0 "Our police have worked well. They were on the beach at the exact moment the small discreet boat coming from Spain was supposed to land in Algeria. In the boat: Weapons, supplies, along with nationalist and syndicalist books, all sent from the Commune and smuggled through Spain. We know the Communards have been supplying the Algerian resistance for years, sending whatever helps the cause by whatever means they can. However our police have made it clear today with this arrest that smuggling will not be tolerated, we can congratulate them for their effort to keep the country united."
nfa.465.a:0 "As if we don't have enough problems already"

nfa.466.t:0 "Nationalist Algerian Books Seized!"
nfa.466.d:0 "The stash was well hidden, in the basement of a building in a narrow street of a European city of Algeria. Opening the door of the basement lead to the sight of a full stock of nationalist literature, most of it outrageously anti-French, and all of it strictly forbidden. All of the books have been seized by the police, to not let them badly influence anyone again, and thetwo Algerians present at the time of the intervention were arrested for treason.\nFurther inquiry has established that the basement belonged to a young pied-noir living in the district and sympathetic to the nationalist cause, who was consequently arrested too. Those pieds-noirs betraying their own country are a real thorn in our feet, as they have to be judged by French law and defended accordingly. They can also use their privileges to easily build a web of pieds-noirs militants across cities and rent places like the one we just raided to organise. But it is also a cultural disappointment: How bad is the education system for this youth to turn out as treasonous as they are?"
nfa.466.a:0 "We can't even trust our own compatriots anymore"

nfa.468.t:0 "Miners' Strike in Senegal!"
nfa.468.d:0 "The colony of Senegal, the most 'civilized' of all West African ones, and home to the port of Dakar, is usually calm. Tensions are exceptionally low between the population and the colonial government. This is why the announce of a miners' strike went as a shock for the colonial authorities. This morning, the workers of an iron mine refused to go to work and stayed in front of the mine. They claimed better conditions of life and better wages, taking the example of the richness of the colored bourgeoisie in Dakar to legitimize their claims. Fortunately for us, their strike wasn't followed in other mines of the country and, after a single day, the army was sent in to take care of the strikers. Let's hope this isolated incident stays... isolated."
nfa.468.a:0 "Now get back to work!"

nfa.469.t:0 "Resentment Spreads To The Lower Classes Of Senegal" 
nfa.469.d:0 "Senegal is very clearly our most economically dynamic colony in West Africa. The large port of Dakar is supplied with mining resources from the Senegalese countryside and with other goods coming from all of West Africa by railway. This rich export economy relies however on a deep divide between the merchant bourgeoisie in the cities, composed of Frenchmen but also of Black 'évolués' (evoluted) with the French citizenship, and a vast working class, the most visible example of it being the dockers of Dakar and the miners. In reality the lower classes mostly work under a regime of forced labour called by the colonial authorities, most notably to build infrastructure.\nThe Senegalese society is thus very stratified, and this is something the lower classes seem to be starting to realise. Murmurs of jealousy and questioning of the system have spread to the Senegalese working class. 'Why are the ones in Dakar so rich yet we struggle to live correctly?' \nIf Senegal is still far from being prone to revolt, a few strikes have already been put down in the last years and this situation needs to be kept to scrutiny."
nfa.469.a:0 "Well let's hope all of that doesn't breed syndicalism"

nfa.470.t:0 "'Evolués' Support the Idea of Independence"
nfa.470.d:0 "Our source about this issue is a French member of the colonial administration in Dakar, invited by friends to a mondane dinner in which rich French and Black 'évolués' (evoluted) merchants sat together. The administrator expected a friendly atmosphere, after all the 'évolués' have the French citizenship and hold a lot of privileges compared to their black lower class counterparts, suffering under the Code de l'Indigénat. His surprise was thus big when he heard a group of 'évolués' talk about how could Senegal organise itself after an independence. The discussion was unbelievable, the 'évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny anymore. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar... The lesson of the story anyway, is that some of the 'évolués' can unbelievably come back to bite the hand that fed them."
nfa.470.a:0 "This type of thinking doesn't fit a presumably evoluted person"

nfa.476.t:0 "The Prophet of Iriba"
nfa.476.d:0 "In Iriba, a small city in Chad, a man started calling himself a new prophet. First he encouraged the locals to kill their cattle to prevent them from transforming into lions, panthers and vultures. Then he told them that they had to stop paying their taxes and throw away their French money. Finally, he announced that White people were leaving the country: the governor of the nearby city of Biltine had already been driven out by natives, and that it was their duty to kill all Whites left to be able to finally live free. To help them fulfill this mission from Allah, the dead would even come back to life and swarm the French garrisons. Not that they had anything to fear: according to the “prophet”, the guns of the Frenchmen now only fired water.\n\n Few were truly convinced, but the brewing resentment of the peoples of Chad only needed the tiniest spark: a small insurgency broke out under the leadership of the madman, a returning patrol was swarmed and massacred and soon the local garrison was under siege. Order was quickly restored and the madman publicly executed, but the whole strange affair is a warning: the situation far from Algiers is more than volatile."
nfa.476.a:0 "At least now they know our guns still fire bullets."

nfa.477.t:0 "Clash Against the Tuaregs"
nfa.477.d:0 "The war led against the Tuaregs of Niger during the 1910's had been successful, but led to other unsuspected problems. The Tuaregs, having being driven off some of the usual roaming lands, had been made to sometimes live in more inhospitable regions. There, unable to rely on cattle farming like they usually do, they had to get more creative. This was the reason for their attack this morning on a Nigerien village, close from the desert but fertile enough to have farms and reserves. A small Tuareg force arrived at dawn to pillage the farms and steal the food reserves, but they didn't anticipate the presence of a small French patrol resting in the village. The French presence wasn't planned, and it only constituted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuaregs. A few shots made one of the horses fall, with a Tuareg tribesman falling on his head. Another Tuareg was shot in the belly, and a French soldier was gravely injured before the force fled and left the village. The French soldiers got to congratulate themselves before leaving to help their wounded friend, the village however had to rebuild on its own."
nfa.477.a:0 "That'll teach you!"

nfa.478.t:0 "Assassination in Chad!"
nfa.478.d:0 "Grave news has arrived to the colonial headquarters of Chad in Abéché. Another French official got attacked this morning and later died in the hospital. These assassinations of Frenchmen are fairly frequent as a sign of protest against the colonial rule which has the record of brutally imposing its decisions in the recently conquered region of Chad. Investigation is always hard in a region where the population isn't cooperative and it is likely we will never find the murderer, as always."
nfa.478.a:0 "At least we can pray for his soul"

nfa.479.t:0 "Attack On a Patrol in Niger"
nfa.479.d:0 "We quite often send patrols across the north of Niger to assure our supremacy in these lands. As we don't have a lot of permanent bases there from where to assert our control we have to resort to such regular patrols. The patrols are usually uneventful but it wasn't the case this time. Our soldiers were suddenly attacked by a full Tuareg force armed and determined, they were hiding behind a relief waiting for the patrol to come closer before they charged with cavalry towards it. The first panicked shots of the patrol did make a few horses fall; however it soon was the French horses that started to fall as another group of Tuaregs hidden in the dunes started shooting from another angle. Completely helpless and surprised, soldiers fell left and right to the bullets and the blades of the Tuaregs before the survivors retreated disorderly. One of the survivors managed to get back to the nearest colonial outpost to tell this story.\n\nThe attack is an outrage but we are quite powerless to punish them unless we send a full blown army to search the desert. We will have to punish people nearer from us, who are probably Tuareg collaborators anyway..."

nfa.614.d:0 "When we started our revolt, no one knows what it was going to lead too, some were pessimistic, others more optimistic but everyone was determined to fight for our independence. This determination has now borne its fruit and after this long war, the French colonists had no other choice than to offer us peace and recognise that their rule over our country has ended. This day will be marked forever as the glorious day of our independence."

nfa.623.t:0 "The Collapse of the French Empire"
nfa.623.d:0 "With Algeria occupied, the center of our power in Africa has now fallen to enemy advance. Without our administrative base, it becomes impossible to continue ruling over Africa, our domination has thus de facto ended in our colonial possessions. Everywhere in Africa, our garrisons and administrators are thrown out by emboldened mobs of natives. Our officials and soldiers have to flee to whatever place feels more secure, but soon there won't be any of those anymore. Some Frenchmen already plan to flee to continue the fight, but most of them accept this fact: the war is lost, and we will soon be strangers in our own home.\n\nThe French state in exile is no more."

nfa.624.d:0 "We have lost control. The Empire of thousands of square kilometers, spanning several ancient kingdoms and thousands of ecosystems, lakes, savananas and forests we built of ourselves in Africa is no longer in our control. Our army was pushed back by native revolts, revealing themselves way more organised and efficient that we first thought. The first defeat came off as a terrible blow, but then it kept getting downhill, until putting our heartland of Algeria in danger. The situation is truly hopeless. Our only chance to survive more than a few weeks is now to recognise the independance of all of the native states and retreat back to Algeria where we can hope to reorganise and defend our nation. With a bit of luck and an efficient fight against Algerian and internal troublemakers maybe we will be able to stay afoot? Maybe this won't be the end for us... right?"

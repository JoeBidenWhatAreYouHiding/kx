RPG_totalist_party_long:0 "Rossiyskaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya\n§LRussian Communist Party§!\n§gThe Russian Communist Party emerged from a left-wing group of Bolsheviks, that were against Bukharin. The RKP, led by Zinoviev, supports orthodox Leninism, collectivisation, rapid industrialisation and is strongly opposed to Bukharin's market socialism. The RKP is banned in Russia, but they still retain a solid following. They may see an opportunity to take power if the situation in the country radically changes.§!"
RPG_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Partiya Levykh Sotsialistov-revolyutsionerov\n§LParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries§!\n§gThe Party of the Left Socialists-Revolutionaries (PLSR) has traversed a tumultuous path since its inception as an ally of the Bolsheviks during the revolution. Though its fortunes waned after the civil war, the PLSR's resilience and commitment to their ideals enabled their survival and resurgence. Following their shift from Bolshevik allies to adversaries, the PLSR faced political isolation and a loss of support. However, they managed to avoid bans and arrests that affected other groups. This allowed them to persist and eventually regain their footing in the Russian political landscape. A notable transformation occurred within the PLSR, as Steinberg's anarcho-syndicalist economic-political doctrine gained prominence. This ideology bordered on anarchism and libertarian socialism, emphasizing workers' self-governance through syndicates and soviets. This shift towards extreme leftist ideals showcased the party's commitment to the empowerment of the working class. Amidst the social upheaval that gripped Russia, the PLSR seized the opportunity to regain momentum. Spiridonova and the Left SRs emerged as leaders in strikes and peasant uprisings, appealing to the left-wing radical electorate. Spiridonova's image as a revolutionary symbol further boosted their standing, culminating in a government ban on Left SR activities in 1928.§!"
RPG_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Narodnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya\n§LPeople's Socialist Party§!\n§gFormed in the wake of the Bolshevik split, the NSP represents the ideological divergence within the revolutionary movement. The party's origins lie in the right wing of the former Bolsheviks, which advocated for a more gradual transition to socialism and placed emphasis on the support of the peasantry. Led by Bukharin and Rykov, who had disassociated themselves from the Bolsheviks, the party aimed to create a socialist path distinct from the one followed by the previous regime. The party supports peaceful progression towards a socialist government with a unique socialist economic plan, the NEP. The NEP describes a system entailing a coexistence of markets, private property, and a planned economy.§!"
RPG_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Rabochaya Partiya\n§LRussian Social Democratic Labour Party§!\n§gDuring the Constituent Assembly elections, the Mensheviks, led by Yuliy Martov, secured second place, positioning themselves as a key party advocating for the rights of the proletariat. Their absence paved the way for their prominence. Despite their socialist stance, the Mensheviks maintained cooperation with the government, and some of their reforms received approval from Kerensky. From the outset, the Mensheviks faced internal divisions. Martov led the faction of Internationalists, bolstered by the success of the French proletarian revolution. A more radical group of Lozovskiy's Novozhiznentsy, which had briefly collaborated with the Bolsheviks, merged back into the Mensheviks. Conversely, a right-wing faction, led by Askelrod, and then - Potresov and Tsereteli, advocated for bourgeois-oriented reform and cooperation with liberal and Socialist-Revolutionary parties.§!"
RPG_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov\n§LParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries§!\n§gThe Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR) has held the reins of power for the past 15 years, but its leadership and policies have been marked by internal divisions and external challenges. Despite being in power, the PSR's program was often deemed too radical by President Kerensky, who maintained his nominal membership in the party. Viktor Chernov, the PSR leader, held significant positions but remained in the shadows. His focus was more on promoting Socialist-Revolutionary reforms and aligning with the Mensheviks rather than the Kadets. The 1932 elections marked a turning point for the PSR. They lost the Duma elections to the NRPR, and only a coalition with the Kadets prevented a complete defeat. Fearing the activities of Savinkov and the NRPR, Kerensky tightened legislation against opposition parties and assemblies, leading to heightened security measures. By 1936, attempts on high-ranking officials, including Kerensky, escalated. Despite this environment, factions within the PSR remain divided on the party's future. Some advocate for cooperation with the Kadets, while others lean towards Savinkov and his right-wing orientation. The PSR faces complex choices in navigating these internal and external dynamics.§!"
RPG_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Konstitutsionno-Demokraticheskaya Partiya\n§LConstitutional Democratic Party§!\n§gThe Party of Constitutional Democrats (Kadets) has been an enduring presence in Russia's political landscape, drawing support from a diverse spectrum of liberal-minded individuals. From landowners and industrialists to merchants, bankers, teachers, doctors, employees, and intellectuals, the Kadets' constituency represents a broad cross-section of society. Emerging as the sole major non-socialist entity, the party secured a third-place position in the Constituent Assembly elections, asserting itself as a pivotal force in shaping Russia's future.§!"
RPG_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Vserossiyskiy Natsionalniy Soyuz\n§LAll-Russian National Union§!\n§gThe All-Russian National Union (VNS) is a paramount conservative political party in Russia, serving as a unifying force for various nobles, landlords, and constitutional monarchists. Originally established in 1908, the party brought together different conservative factions and organizations across the nation. Following the turmoil of the Civil War, the VNS was reconstituted in 1922 in direct opposition to the republican governance that had emerged. Led by Vasily Shulgin, the party's primary aim is to restore constitutional monarchy in Russia, reverse federalization policies, and reassert the primacy of Russians as the core nationality in the country. Vasily Shulgin's leadership within the VNS signifies a fervent commitment to the reinstatement of a constitutional monarchy in Russia. Championing a progressive interpretation of nationalism, Shulgin envisions a monarchy rooted in democratic principles, striving to initiate a referendum to determine the future monarch. His vision extends beyond mere restoration, aiming to reformulate the monarchy's role in a rapidly evolving society. By prioritizing the unity of the nation and embracing a more inclusive approach, Shulgin's faction seeks to merge historical values with contemporary governance, ensuring that the monarchy serves as a symbol of national cohesion.§!"

Originally established in 1908, the party brought together different conservative factions and organizations across the nation. Following the turmoil of the Civil War, the VNS was reconstituted in 1922 in direct opposition to the republican governance that had emerged. Dmitry Romanov and Felix Yusupov spearhead a faction within the VNS that embraces a diverse range of political and economic objectives. While retaining loyalty to the idea of constitutional monarchy, Romanov and Yusupov prioritize personal and economic influence within the government. Romanov, who holds legitimate claims to the throne, exhibits aspirations for an aristocratic republic founded on a strong authoritarian rule. This faction also features Yusupov's influential perspective, advocating for a future centered around oligarchy and substantial capital influence. United by their ambitions, they seek to consolidate power within their ranks and navigate the intricacies of Russia's evolving political landscape.§!"
RPG_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Rossiyskiy Obshche-Voinskiy Soyuz\n§LRussian All-Military Union§!\n§gThe Russian All-Military Union is an organization created by Russian General Lavr Kornilov. It seek to unite all White Army generals that were opposed to Bolsheviks during the civil war. The ROVS believes that socialism is a curse, and that Russia should be led by a strong ruler, willing to unite and stabilize the fractured country by any means necessary.§!"
RPG_national_populist_party_long:0 "Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii\n§LPeople's Republican Party of Russia§!\n§gThe NRPR stands as a synthesis of diverse ideological currents that have found resonance within Boris Savinkov. This intricate blend entails an authoritarian and all-encompassing system of governance, underscored by a fervent belief in Agrarian Socialist Neo-Narodnichestvo. The party also champions the cause of Revolutionary Christianity, serving as a form of apocalyptic rebirth for leading to the creation of a Third Russia. At the helm of the NRPR stands Boris Savinkov, a former SR member and a figure known for his terrorist past and resolute ideals. Savinkov's leadership is marked by a fervent dedication to his vision, driven by the belief in the righteousness of his cause. As uncertain future looms, the 'Vozhd,' has succeeded in galvanizing a broad spectrum of the revolutionary and protest-oriented electorate. With a distinctive blend of agrarian socialism, authoritarianism, and a promise of rebirth, the NRPR has positioned itself as a formidable contender. While the path to victory may not be without challenges, the party's increasing influence suggests that it may yet shape the future of Russia.§!"

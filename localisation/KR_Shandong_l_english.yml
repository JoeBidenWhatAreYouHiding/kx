POLITICS_SONG_ZHEYUAN_DESC:0 "Born during the waning years of the 'century of humiliation', Song was educated by his uncle, a Confucian teacher in Yanshan, Shandong. In 1904, Song traveled to Beijing to learn receive military instruction under Lu Jianzhang. After a decade of service, Lu Jianzhang slotted Song into service under Yuan Shikai during his rise. Following the assault on Zhang Xun in Beijing, Song deserted Yuan to join the KMT, and threw in his loyal divisions under their government. In 1925, Song requested Chiang governorship of Shandong should the province be claimed. The subsequent Northern Expedition fell apart for Song in 1929, and he held Linyi in Shandong against Zhang Zongchang. Any hope of reinforcements were dashed by 1930, depriving Song of legitimacy. A solution to this crisis in confidence came when Song heard the Duke Yansheng was in mortal danger. Living in the Mount Tai Miao, the descendant of Confuicius was threatened by the newly-arrived Yiguandao, which desputed his orthodox religion. Song organized a rescue of the Duke Yansheng in 1931, and his conspirators swore an oath upon his rescue to create the Society for Restoring Benevolence."
POLITICS_ZHANG_ZONGCHANG_DESC:0 "Zongchang himself felt no great national pride for Qingdao when it was lost in 1897 to Germany, but the 1911 revolution did motivate him to action. Arriving in Shanghai to pledge allegiance to the Republic, he fell in with Feng Guozhang and joined the Zhili Clique when they emerged in 1917. When the Fengtian and Zhili Clique turned on each other in 1920, Zongchang was withdrawing his forces from across Northern China back into Shandong. This allowed Zongchang to commit most of his forces to the Fengtian Clique when Zhang Zhoulin made peace with Sun Yat Sen in 1926. Zongchang ordered his army again to retreat into Shandong when the Fengtian Clique needed him most. This retreat made Shandong into his prison as well as refuge, where he was an illegal but tolerated occupying force under the shadow of the Qing. An ability to utilize railroads effectively as well as the unusual charisma of a man referred to as “filthy” by even his allies carried him through to victory. As medicine was out of his reach financially, a bout of sickness drew him up the 6,600 steps to a Yiguandao doctor. Zongchang eventually met the Yiguandao’s Honored Teacher, Zhang Tianran. Whether it was his sickness or the lack of anything else to do up on Mount Tai, Zongchang promised Tianran that he would follow the esoteric lifestyle espoused by the cult for his health."
POLITICS_ZHANG_TIANRAN_DESC:0 "Tianran aspired to nothing in his life until he was introduced into the cult of Lu Zhongyi. Lu Zhongyi was the leader of a small group of religious syncretists called the Yiguandao in 1918. Lu Zhongyi had always planned for his sister Lu Zhongjie to succeed him to lead the Yiguandao, and had even recognized her supposed divinity as the reincarnation of the Buddhist God Guan Yin. A theological schism occurred after the passing of Lu Zhongyi in 1930, wherein Lu Zhongjie took followers loyal to her out of the Yiguandao and relocated to Henan, where they remain to this day. Tianran, having the full trust of his members as well as a newly divined wife Sun Suzhen, began to tell startling revelations. In 1922, Tianran had built a shrine on Mount Tai, which grew until it encompassed the other monasteries on the mountain. By 1924 Mount Tai had become the year-round home for Zhang Tianran and his inner circle. A spirit writing session that same year foretold Emperor Puyi was in danger of being poisoned, and a trip to Beijing was planned. Tianran amused and flattered Emperor Puyi with promises that the Yiguandao would reinforce loyalty to the Qing through charity and warfare if need be. The first Red Spears and Big Swords arrived to Mount Tai in 1925. The greatest catch was Tianran’s supposed conversion of Zhang Zongchang in 1935."

Li's first major decoration was in fighting the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. An association with Anhui general Qu Tongfeng guided Li towards clique politics during the republican years. Like Qu Tongfeng, who was cast out of the Anhui Clique for corruption, Li was set adrift and found his way into the Fengtian clique in 1924. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin reassigned Li that year to Zhang Zongchang, who was fighting in Zhili. Li was initially impressed with Zhang Zongchang's ability in spite of his lack of manners, but this appreaisal turned sour by 1928, when Zongchang became entrenched in Shandong. Li, despite his history of corruption, could not properly pay his division on taxes collected honestly in Shandong. Li, having taken inspiration from the decleration of Xue Dian as the Yiguandao's minor Emperor in Shandong, decided to present himself as spiritually enlightened. Li publicly began training in Wudang swordsmanship, and named himself 'the Magic Sword' to provide an air of mystery. This ultimately caught the attention of Zhang Tianran who has given Li several offers to train with Big Sword militas at Taishan."

This service continued when Feng Yuxiang joined Yuan Shikai, and ended in Feng Anbang's desertion of Feng Yuxiang following Zhang Xun's failure in 1917. This betrayal led Feng Anbang into the Anhui Clique, and served as an infantry commander for them until 1924. This relationship ended when Feng Anbang was accused of taking bribes, leading to a forced retirement to Shandong. Feng's experience commanding infantry was not forgotten, and he was hired by the incoming Zhang Zongchang to train his army in 1931. In exchange, Zongchang forwarded a pardon for Feng's crimes from Zhang Zuolin, which enables Feng to move freely once more. Feng commanded some of Zongchang's soldiers throughout the early 1930s to assault bandit holdings in central Shandong, becoming recognized for his discipline above most commanders in Shandong."

The Zhang family, seeing the future in western businesses up north, moved Huizhi to Tianjin at a young age. As a student at the Tianjing military equipment school, Zhang Huaizhi join in the Boxer rebellion with his regiment, and was commended for bombarding the Legation quarter. The guilt of losing to the westenrers drove the disgraced Zhang into the army of Yuan Shikai, whose ambitious goal of becoming an Emperor felt like more of a natural evolution for Zhang than republicanism. After Yuan died, Zhang fell in with the Anhui clique, and briefly served under Zhang Shuyuan as an administrator in Shandong in 1918. Zhang eventually failed his leader again after his regiment fell fighting in Hunan. This left Zhang Huaizhi destitute again, and the only people who would take him was the Yiguandao.

This ensures that the core leadership has enough chips to adjust the cult to fit their personal goals. First among this group is Teacher Zhang Tianran, the successor to Lu Zhongyi. Through Tianran’s political maneuvering, the cult has grown to about 7 million adherents across China, with only 500,000 members located within the Shangqing itself.                                       Peasant Armies throughout Northern China, particularly the Big Swords Society and Red Spears Society, see the Yiguandao as the most morally upright government in China.§!"

shandong.1.t:0 "1936; Turning Point in Shandong"
shandong.1.d:0 "The province of Shandong has been carved up of its most valuable land by the Legation States and Germany. The port of Qingdao, once devastated by war between Japan and Germany, now serves as an important port for both the Imperial German Navy and for civilian trade by the Algostasien GmbH. This situation has made Jinan the perfect home for the real power in Shandong. Zhang Zongchang. Zhang came to Shandong in 1911, ostensibly to lead the Shandong Revolutionary Army, but quickly made gambling and whoring his main activity. Jinan has grown like the Dogmeat General has; filthy, profitable, and less defended than initially planned. Atop Tai Shan’s 6,600 steps are the headquarters of the Yiguandao. The mysterious and apparently holy Zhang Tianran has made it the safest and most morally upright place in Shandong. The citizens of Shandong by 1936 have been cornered between disconnected, poverty stricken roads between Jinan and Weihaiwei. Salvation lies in the nearby Jinan or atop Mount Tai."

### Political Events###
shandong.2.t:0 "Lu Zhongjie Arrives to Jinan"
shandong.2.d:0 "This day brings to Zongchang another opportunity to humiliate the old man on the mountain, Zhang Tianran. In order to establish his little cult on the hill, Tianran had to expel the sister of his former master, Lu Zhongyi. The sister, Lu Zhongjie, has become a rather concise rebuttal to the numerous Yiguandao well-wishers Zongchang has had to deal with in recent months. This is why she must return to Shandong, if only as a joke. To enhance the shock value, Zongchang has brought his old mother to this welcoming ceremony, which has swelled from the intended group into a sizable crowd. Zongchang, in an attempt to enhance the humiliation Tianran should feel, has given the elderly Lu Zhongjie a bouquet and a traditional twenty-one gun salute was fired into a nearby apartment building in celebration of Lu Zhongjie's arrival."
shandong.2.a:0 "Bullets have to go somewhere"

shandong.970.t:0 "Zongchang's festivities escelate through Jinan"
shandong.970.d:0 "After that rouse of fun and violence, Zongchang dropped his mother off with Lu Zhongjie and has decided to celebrate a night on the town. Zongchang stops ocassionally to distribute 'Minsheng' to refugees from Jiangsu. Another encounter that day were Yiguandao protesters at Zongchang's business office. Their daily empty promises have been replaced by outrage over Lu Zhongjie's return to Shandong. Before Zongchang attempted to hit them with his car, they claimed that Tianran would arrive to judge Zongchang's very soul. The only thing that soured the evening was finding out that Zongchang's opium dealer is still in hiding. This no doubt is caused by interloping Ren Ci who have foiled otherwise fun evenings in Jinan with their morality in the past. The adventure ended with a visit to Zongchang's favorite brothel, where several women joined his entourage on the way home that evening to do drugs. As the day comes to an end, one of these ladies has gone missing with some opium, Zongchang asks his officers not to go after her, for there is still plenty more ladies and capsules of opium for the night."
shandong.970.a:0 "Her loss then"

shandong.3.t:0 "A spy for Zheyuan is captured"
shandong.3.d:0 "After a night of hard drugs and soft women in Jinan, Zongchang was reveling in himself the next morning when he saw a stranger in his backyard. Alerting his wives, and then his guards, Zongchang apprehended the intruder. After Sun Dianying's own special words with the man, it was revealed that he was an ally of Song Zheyuan, and had come after a sex worker had alerted him to drugs on the property. Dianying believes that this intruder is the vanguard of a rebellion Zheyuan is planning out of Qufu. A fear Dianying has stoked for several months since his income from taxation was cut off by Zheyuan's militia. Commander Junnosuke Date, on the other hand, insists to the hungover Zongchang that Zheyuan is planning to alert the Qing instead. Junnosuke insists that their forces be diverted to Dezhou to stop Zheyuan from escaping. Barely able to recall the night before, Zongchang decides to..."
shandong.3.a:0 "Block the roads, Zheyuan must be leaving"
shandong.3.b:0 "Send men to Zheyuan's house"

shandong.971.t:0 "Junnosuke Date attacks Zheyuan at Dezhou"
shandong.971.d:0 "Junnosuke Date's forces arrived at Dezhou to strong public distaste, stronger revulsion than usual. It was immediately apparent that the town has been turned over to the Ren Ci and Zheyuan. Junnosuke sent his cavalry into Dezhou to search out Zheyuan, with the looming and dangerous prospect of a possible raid into the Qing kingdom. Zheyuan was found near the Haido Jinshan temple, paying respects to his ancestors. Junnosuke's soldiers seized Zheyuan, and a skirmish began between his Ren Ci militiamen and the cavalry. Fortunately Junnosuke brought enough firepower to eliminate the militia and Zheyuan in the process. Unfortunately, the abundance of witnesses in Dezhou required a lot more fighting to silence. At the end of the battle, the Haido Jinshan temple was in flames, and Junnosuke was retreating back towards Jinan trying his best to think up an alibi."
shandong.971.a:0 "That was a Boxer temple, nobody will care"

shandong.972.t:0 "Sun Dianying fails to find Zheyuan at Qufu"
shandong.972.d:0 "The soldiers sent to Qufu found what they wanted, but not what they needed. After threats of violence were given by Dianying, and several quarters burned, the occupants of Qufu fled as Dianying began searching for Zheyuan. While there was abundant evidence that the Ren Ci had used the manor, neither Zheyuan nor the Duke Yansheng were to be found. Zongchang waited several days for a response from Dianying, and received Dianying's most humble apologies and gifts from Confcuian manor. These gifts did little to sate Zongchang's anger, who immediately set out with the Japanese cavalry to Dezhou, furious that Junnosuke's advice was not taken. Zongchang's arrival in Dezhou failed to find Zheyuan, not even evidence of him being there. Faced with the dangerous prospect of sending a raid into the Qing kingdom on the hunch of Junnosuke Date, Zongchang decided the investigation was over, and returned to Jinan to continue his harassment campaign on the Yiguandao."
shandong.972.a:0 "At least I got some gifts out of this"

shandong.4.t:0 "Zongchang sends an alibi to the Qing"
shandong.4.d:0 "Several books of poetry, and a commentary on the classics has proven to be very helpful to Zongchang at this moment. Letters that used to contain embarassing misspellings and poor stroke order are now refined in a golden alibi Zongchang has sent to the Qing government. This alibi intends to answer what caused such a panic in Dezhou recently, and why this issue should not bother Puyi or Wu Peifu in the least. The letter paints the picture of a province filled with bandits and conmen. This enviroment, explains the letter, leads to unfounded rumors of moral decay in Shandong, which is certainly exaggerations by conmen like Zhang Tianran. Furthermore, the letter adds that Zongchang had found and eliminated a cell of KMT holdouts in Shandong, and there is no reason to be concerned about traitors to the emperor, no matter what they may claim."

shandong.5.t:0 "Qing Magistrates Arrest Zongchang"
shandong.5.d:0 "Sun Dianying was a fool. While he was burining and looting Zheyuan's manor, the man himself was already halfway to Beijing. Despite Dianying's excuses and efforts to uncover the plotters in Shandong, it left Jinan vunerable to a large contigent of Qing infantry that entered Jinan. Even worse, Zongchang had no way of knowing the Qing soliders were there to arrest him. A written letter by Zongchang from prison to the Emperor asking him to allow family visitation has been rejected. Zongchang now has a forth Unknown, unknown when he will be released from prison for his numerous crimes. The other day, one of the many children of Zongchang approached Song Zhyuan, asking him if his father will survive his imprisonment."

The intial reaction being delivered in a request to return to Mount Tai for more treatment of his long-gone illness. These letters were ignored by Zongchang, wishing to further annoy the teacher on the mountain and to humiliate him by publicly reading the letters. Finally the last letter delivered today took on a much darker tone. The letter addressed the people of Jinan, and accused Zongchang of smuggling opium into China, betraying Chinese for Western gambling partners, and of trying to take Lu Zhongjie as a wife. Tianran has challenged Zongchang to come to Mount Tai to receive his eternal judgement, or else the people of Shandong will wither and die to punish their leader. Sun Dianying recommends contronting and purifying Mount Tai of its residents, while another commander, Zhang Jingyao, recommends waiting the teacher out."

As Zongchang passed under the Zhengyang Gate, he was fatally shot by a sharpshooter from atop the gate. Dianying attempted to charge the courtyard with whatever men he had, but Jingyao had fled with the soldiers guarding his rear. Dianying was also fatally shot, and the current wherebouts of Zhang Jingyao is unknown. The honored teacher Zhang Tianran was received in Jinan with an early New Years celebration, and read his final letter to Zongchang to a cheering crowd."

Members of the public have defaced Zongchang's office, and several former friends have written to Zongchang asking him to prostrate himself before the Yiguandao. In return, Zongchang has told his commanders to man the walls of Jinan, extort and search all suspected Yiguandao members they come across, and deliver anything suspicious to him. Several of the items confiscated included poison labeled as medicine, small arms, and curses against Zongchang. Today Zongchang was delivering another reading of Tianran's letter, along with a dissertation into the evils of the Yiguandao, when a mob of them entered the city. Zongchang's soldiers quickly engaged the cultists that were carrying guns, and Japanese cavalry chased the rest out. Tianran, while attempting to hide his shining head, was caught and shot by the cavalry."

When rumor spread that Zongchang had Tianran along with all of the Yiguandao fighters buried dishonorably in a mass grave, panic spread across Shandong. The remaining Yiguandao across Shandong have begun to aggressively attack policemen and landlords throughout the province. Townspeople, fearing both the fanatic and the now-demonized Zongchang clique, have begun to shield themselves from the outside world. They will not respond to any governing authority, and must be dealt with."

Hanchtedelay has ambitions to transform several Studebaker cars that he owns into crude tanks. A second plan is to purchase Flying Pigeon bicycles from Tianjin and train a divison to use them.

An ongoing police investigation has only determined that it is not the trainline employees, no other possibilites have been ruled out yet. [SQI.GetLeader] has been called in to suprvise the investigation before it becomes a major scandal in Jinan. The police, ever cautious of the chinese border guards outside of Qingdao, have suggested we investigate the railway relay stations first. [SQI.GetLeader], on the other hand, is of the suspition that the items are being stolen along the deserted stretches of countryside between Qingdao and Jinan. Which should we investigate first?"

These constructs appear to be a cushion and luggage straps. There is no doubt that whomever has been stealing from the rail lines has been throwing their hauls off the train, where it is moved to a second location.

Upon inspecting the floor of the shack, however, a large empty alcove was discovered. There being no logical use for such a large empty space below the shack, the police chief has decided to arrest the attending border guards.

Finally, in astonishment, several bandits exited the hold and removed their clothing. These bandits then dropped their weapons, and began to haul the trunks towards our offensive line. In shock, [SQI.GetLeader] ordered his line to hold heir fire, and let these apparently insane bandits pass. Soldiers were in such an uproar of laughter humiliating these bandits, that nobody noticed that another contigent of bandits had slipped through the woods until the whole display was over. A scramble over this ruse resulted in the death of the nude bandits, but it appears the other group has escaped Eastern Shandong."

These men were detained in Hebei, where they produced evidence of [SQI.GetLeader] being involved in the drug trade. This claim moved rapidly to Beijing, where our investigators have verified the evidence as genuine. Opium and other drugs are often seen as responsible for the collapse of traditional Chinese morality over the past century, and therefore a major cause of its continuous humiliation at the hands of foreign powers. As we are the national government, with a reputation to uphold, this is a very serious matter indeed. Should we dismiss the claims of these bandits, or should we ready a military intervention to restore law in Shandong? Most experts agree that [SQI.GetLeader] cannot be retired without the total subordination of the clique."

The Yiguandao guards claim she is a matriarch like Tianran's wife, Sun Suzhen, but she stands before him with two pistols on her belt. Zhao Hong Wenguo, mother of Beijing student leader Zhao Dong, is here to offer her families services to the Yiguandao. Zhao Hong Wenguo claims to do this not out of religious loyalty or financial need, but because the Yiguandao appears to her the essential resistance against Japanese aggression that threatens her home. The Honored Master agrees, and reiterates his promise to never cooperate with the Japanese in exchange for her families financial and tactical services.

Within the inner circle of the Yiguandao, a debate rages between Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen over how to best engage the literati in Shandong. Tianran and Suzhen have both collaborated on a book entitled 'Provisional Etiquette', intended to demonstrate how the Yiguandao respects the spiritual lineage of chinese leadership. To Zhang Tianran, who was once a minor bureaucrat under Yuan Shikai, the spiritual lineage of China's dictator went from the Regent Zaifeng to Yuan Shikai, then finally to the enthroned Puyi. To Sun Suzhen however, spiritual lineage in China belonged to Sun Yat-Sen, and through Sun Yat-Sen's death there is no true spiritual leader of China currently. Zhang's interpretation appears to hold to his agreement to promote Puyi as Emperor within the Yiguandao, but ignores the wellspring of spiritual support for the southern idealists."

The last aeon, that of the Red Sun, ended with the Xinhai Revolution. The Confucian legend Kang Yuowei is refenced in Zhang Tianran's speech, which agreed that the third age, Datong, or Maha-Kalpa was dawning. Soon, claims Tianran, the Chinese people will be perfected racially or be destroyed by foreigners like the Japanese Emperor or the British Empire.\n\nTo the uncertain people of Shandong, the only concrete suggestion out of so much esoteric ado is that they should work harder towards national unification, and reinforces the already-prevelant feeling of existential struggle they feel."

After following a tip that the Teacher Juzan spoke to Lu Zhongjie when he published his defamation againt us, the Red Spears snuck into Hunan. One of our most loyal minor Emperors has managed to hunt her down and bring her back to us, after all these years. Within the inner circle, a debate rages over how to handle this windfall. To Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen, keeping Lu Zhongjie alive is tempting further dissenters to venerate her as the reincarnated Guan Yin.

Yet still there is mining in Eastern Shandong. A more radical solution has been concocted, which has Zhang Zongchang fund a coal miner syndicate to empower coal miners to fight their bosses.

After several hours, Zhang Tianran emerged from Xue Dian's quarters, and stated that the Minor Emperor was called by a greater power to commit to an immediate and permanent pilgrimage. While the Red Spears soldiers are sated, the dissidents outside of Taishan have easily deduced that Xue Dian and Lu Zhongjie have escaped the cult.

shandong.447.d:0 "With our warlord clique expanding to control the vast heartland of China thanks to the glorious and stalwart, if albeit unhinged, leadership of the great Dogmeat General himself Zhang Zongchang, the future of the Middle Kingdom now lies in the hands of the Bastard of Shandong. All under heaven now lies within his hands, and now the destiny of all of China is his to decide. \n\nThe Dogmeat general has always been mercurial and chameleon-like, changing his apparent and public opinions or views depending on the current situation, always seeking a path towards the most advantageous outcome like a ingenious and crafty scavenger. With this in mind, Zhang has outlined a few possible avenues towards complete and total power, each differing in how they would allow such an outcome. \n\nThe first and most obvious choice for Zhang is to continue his warlord ways as the true Dogmeat General, ruling all of China like his own personal fiefdom, with his generals and sycophants each taking a slice of China to administer under Zhang’s banner. However, such a plan lacks ambition or gravitas, and so Zhang has plotted other routes forward. In order to create a more legitimate state with a more legitimate form of government and bureaucratic structure behind it, Zhang could go declare either a new Republic of China with himself as President while taking notes from sources like the RKMT, or he could go with the traditional route, attempting to succeed where Yuan Shikai failed by proclaiming a new Chinese Empire. However, such moves would require great effort and widespread support - something Zhang lacks heavily. Instead, Zhang could turn to a foreign group instead, either inviting the failed Qing Dynasty or the Japanese to come aid him in his rule of all China. \n\nWith Zhang Zongchang seeking complete power and perfected hedonism above all other pursuits, the choice is entirely up to his whim as he seeks to reorganize his new China."

In an audacious move rarely seen in Chinese history, Zhang has decided to keep his own name as his regal name, even going to the length of naming his own new dynasty after himself as well. So rises Emperor Zhang of the Zhang Dynasty who shall move to make all under Heaven within China’s hands once more. \n\nDespite his ambition and dedication to this pursuit of empire-building, that has not stopped others from poking fun at this deranged drug and sex addict declaring himself emperor. With the Mandarin words for shameful being similar to Zhang’s name, and with similar meaning and contemporary usage to the English word ‘bastard’, the oft-called Dogmeat Bastard’s new and unprestigious royal dynasty has been ridiculed and mocked as being the Hùn Zhàng, or Bastard/Shameful, Dynasty, much to the chagrin of the new Emperor himself. \n\nRegardless of these petty jokes and powerless detractors, Zhang has gone about on his way of creating a new empire that lives up to his heaven-high standards, ambitions, and tastes. Whether or not this empire holds together for long does not matter, for the Bastard Emperor shall enjoy the wild ride up or down on a wave of drugs, gambling, whores, and violence just like he always has - but now backed and funded by the vast wealth of all China under the prestigious guise of traditional monarchism."

With support from his military clique, as well as his new allies - a group of opportunists and pragmatists from the RKMT - Zhang is prepared to make a mockery of Chinese Conservative Republicanism in order to wear a thin veneer of legitimacy and to scrape up some meager support from the masses. Though this new RoC shall be a far cry from the comparatively Liberal positions of the Xinhai revolutionaries, it is a step away from pure and outward warlordism that none would have expected from the infamous Dogmeat General. Using a shackled Republican system with weak but active local elective governments all overseen by generals and RKMT politicians loyal to President Zhang, this new Republic of China shall run on criminal vice, Zhang’s hedonism, ethically-gray Capitalism, and severely compromised Republican Democratic principles. With this system in place, ‘President’ Zhang Zongchang will be able to rule China largely as he once did during the Warlord Era, but slightly tamed and heavily secured by Republican legitimacy."

Ignoring any pretense of a legitimate government, China will function as Shandong did under the Dogmeat General’s rule. Instead of progressing towards civilization and modernity, China shall turn back the clock as Zhang ignores anything other than his own personal ambitions and desire for more power, more wealth, more women, more intoxicants, and more hedonistic excess as he raids, rapes, and pillages his way across his modern-day fiefdom."

Agreeing to his proposition as they get more and more desperate to hold control of China, the Qing have decided to throw their lot in with the Dogmeat General. While Zhang shall serve as regent, liaison, and military commander, the Qing - as the rightful heirs to the Dragon Throne - seek to put one of their own on the throne in order to keep with tradition and to provide legitimacy and popular support to this partnership. \n\nAll that is left now is to decide on who shall take the throne, and before Zhang and the Qing delegation lies three options. The obvious choice would be to go with Puyi, the last Emperor of China, but due to his recent failures, seeming apathy to the responsibilities of leadership, and his unhinged, temperamental personality, two other candidates have been put forth. The first is Puyi’s younger brother and likely next in line Puji. However, the Aisin-Gioro princess Xianyu - better known from her career as a spy under the name Yoshiko Kawashima - would also be a reliable choice. Now, all Zhang and the Qing need to do is decide on who shall be the next puppet emperor."

While Zhang shall serve as regent, liaison, and military commander, the Japanese shall establish a puppet monarchy upon the Dragon Throne in order to legitimize the partnership and align China to their traditions. However, a monarch still must be chosen. \n\nThe obvious choice is to go with Hirohito, but in order to spread the power of his royal family while also seeking to lessen the amount of work he would have to do as figurehead of this new Chinese client state, the Japanese have suggested two others. The younger brother to the current emperor - Yasuhito - as well as their cousin Kan'in Kotohito have both been raised as possible candidates. Now, it is just up to Zhang and the Japanese delegation to decide before China finally embraces the power of the Rising Sun."

Despite these foolish and obviously tasteless detractors, Zhang has decided to publish a compiled body of his literary works. From selected annotations he wrote on various pieces of Chinese literature such as the Three Kingdoms Saga and the Art of War that he sees as total improvements over the original works to his own memoirs from life on the front and his career as a ladies-man and warlord, the omnibus holds many interesting passages. However, the bulk of the book consists of his poetic writings, with the most famous of all being ‘Poem about Bastards’. \n\n’You tell me to do this, \nHe tells me to do that. \nYou’re all bastards, \nGo fuck your mother.’ \n\nThese simple but touching words are just a taste of the treasures that lie inside this tome.

Agreeing to his proposition as they seek to build an eastern bastion against Japan, the Russians have decided to support the Dogmeat General. While Zhang shall serve as regent, liaison, and military commander, the Russians shall establish a puppet monarchy upon the Dragon Throne in order to legitimize the partnership and align China to their traditions. However, a monarch still must be chosen. \n\nThe obvious choice is to go with the Romanov candidate who stands as the closest biological heir to the throne - Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich. However, as is always the case with these Slavs, this candidate has faced fierce opposition as many question his legitimacy and ability to rule. As an alternative, the Russias have raised the esteemed war hero, monarchist, and noble Pyotr Wrangel as a possible candidate, or even Felix Yusupov - heir to the second largest noble family in Russia aside from the Romanovs. Resisting this prospect, Zhang has put forth his own general Boris Annenkov as a possible candidate for him to rule through. Now, it is just up to Zhang and the Russian delegation to hash out their differences and decide on an  ‘Éluósīzú Emperor of the Báixióng Dynasty’, or White Russian Emperor of the Polar Bear Dynasty, before China finally embraces the power of the Northern Bear."

The second design is more syncretic, fusing the Qing Dragon with the Russian Imperial Eagle on a yellow field as the Imperial Eagle holds two shields in its talons - one emblazoned with the Russian Imperial Tricolor, and the other with the Twelve Symbols emblem.

Now, all we must do is organize the new state we have begun to consolidate. Though the obvious route is to proclaim a new Republic of China with Zheyuan as our President, not all are in agreement with this plan. This is mainly because the Duke Yansheng Kong Lingyi and his young son Kung Te-Cheng have long been under the protection of Song Zheyuan, and though Zheyuan has long held Republican sympathies, that has not stopped a wild plan revolving around crowning the Duke as a new puppet Emperor from hatching within his cadre. Lackeys revolving around the ideas of Liang Qichao, who once sought to prop up the Duke Yansheng as a rival claimant to the Dragon Throne in order to resist the Qing, have gained popularity, and now wish to see this wild plan enacted. Though Kong Lingyi is related to Shang Dynasty royalty through his familial links to both the Dukes of Song and Confucius, these radicals wish to restore the Ming under his regality, seeing it as the last true Chinese dynasty before the invasion of the Manchu. If we caved to these radicals and the ideas of Qichao, Kong Lingyi, and eventually his son, would rise to be the new Emperor of China, serving as our heavenly link and claim to power as Song Zheyuan and Liang Qichao enact their liberalizing reforms and the ideas of the New Culture Movement.  Alternatively, we could just take the far less chaos-inducing route and proclaim the Republic like Zheyuan has always professed he would, and instead work towards these liberalizing goals in a more standard republican setting."

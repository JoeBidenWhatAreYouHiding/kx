CZE_social_democrat_party:0 "ČSDSD"
CZE_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Česká sociálně demokratická strana dělnická §gThe Social-Democrat party is an old-timer to Bohemia, founded in 1878 and carrying an increasing role in Bohemian governance, in tandem with Karl Renner's SDAPÖ. This coincidental co-ordination has meant that the CSDSD has neared more in ideological proxmity to the SDAPÖ. In the Weltkrieg, the CSDSD supported the monarchy wholly and thus did not engage with the Mafia. With the revolutions in France and Britain, the CSDSD suffered a major blow, with many lefter-leaning figures moving to more radical positions. The Social-Democrats believe in worker's rights, the Pardoner's Agreement, and are more pacifist than other parties. It is also no stranger to cooperating with the Agrarians, having participated in coalitions with them before.§!"
CZE_social_liberal_party:0 "Realisté"
CZE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Česká strana pokroková §gThe Realist Party, founded in 1900, was the product of governor T.G. Masaryk and the late Karel Kramář. The party was an advocate for either Austrian federalism or Czech independence. The party was born from Masaryk's experiences in the anti-semitic Hilsner trial, in which a bitter taste had formed towards both the Young and Old Czechs. The party as it is now is pro-Illyrian, pro-democracy, anti-clerical, and very pro-federalism. It also holds a significant nationalist sentiment, but as with most parties in reformed Bohemia, is watched closely, lest they fall out of line. Apparently, in the event Hungary is to rebel, the Realist Party wants to annex Slovakia, a callback to Czechoslovakism of the Weltkrieg.§!"
CZE_market_liberal_party:0 "RSZML"
CZE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republikánská strana zemědělského a malorolnického lidu §gThe Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants, or merely the Agrarian Party, is a political party whose name was forged by the anticipation of an Entente victory that never came. Its programs are of a pragmatic nature, and focus more on what is at home rather than nationalism; although it is still rather nationalist. The RSZML represents the peasants of Moravian and Southern Bohemian towns and villages. When it comes to Bohemian-Germans, the RSZML has a way different approach: to encourage Czechs to move into German-Bohemia. All things aside, the RSZML has good relations with its German counterpart, the Bund der Landwirte.§!"
CZE_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "ČND"
CZE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Česká národní demokracie §gThe National-Democratic Party, much like the Realist Party, was forged in discontent. Dr. Karel Kramář found himself at increasing odds with the Realist Masaryk, thus the National-Democratic party was born. Likely Bohemia's most nationalist party, Vienna shows overt adversity towards the ČND. It is no stranger to the Evidenzbureau, finding itself being tugged on by its shadowy hands. Whether its decline in recent years is thanks to the Evidenzbureau or Karl's federalist reforms as of late, is disputed in the party. Many of the ČND's major figures, including chairman Jiří Stříbrný, have found themselves under the wafts of Romanian legionnairism and Lanz von Liebenfels. However, not all hope is lost for the ČND in the next election.§!"
CZE_social_conservative_party:0 "ČSL"
CZE_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Česká strana lidová §gThe Czech People's Party operates as one of the smaller parties in Bohemia, yet encompasses the majority of religious conservatives. It was birthed in 1921 out of a merger of many minor Catholic parties. Chairman Jan Šrámek's actions have increased the ČSL's influence over Christians in Bohemia, yet it will need a significant stroke of luck and activity if it wants to take the next election. The ČSL believes in classism, market manipulation in Bohemian interests, welfare, and Christian spins on most organizations, such as trade unions and schools. It is the only major party in Bohemia to have even somewhat of a clericalist outlook, even if it is pro-democracy. The ČSL enjoys good relations with its German sister party, who is willing to work more with the ČSL than other Czech parties. If the ČSL wins the election, it could shape Bohemian history forever.§!"

CZE_national_populist_party:0 "Vlajka"
CZE_national_populist_party_long:0 "Český národně socialistický tábor — Vlajka §gThe Vlajka, or the Flag, is a curious case in Bohemian politics. Vlajka's chairman, Jan Rys-Rozsévač, resides in neighboring Germany, away from the Evidenzbureau and frowned upon by many Czech politicians. His party, however, escapes the ire of the authorities, due to its small size and quiet voice compared to the Realists or Agrarians. The Vlajka holds a disdain for T.G. Masaryk and any non-Czechs, save Slovaks. Its program is vehemently anti-Semitic, and occult. Only a traitor would willingly let the Vlajka into power, politicians have told Rozsévač.§!"

BOH_rural_churches:0 "Rurality in God"
BOH_rural_churches_desc:0 "With a majority of the population living in rural towns, steps need to be taken to ensure their quality of life. Luckily, much of the population, especially within our rural communities, are deeply religious and both trust and respect the Church above all other Earthly institutions, giving our government an easy avenue to the hearts and minds of our peasants. By working with the Church closely, we shall endeavor together in order to uplift the rural population through both faith and through legislation. Rurality does not have to be synonymous with squalor and simplicity - we shall make it synonymous with piety, prosperity, and grandeur."
BOH_tip_top_tractors:0 "Acquiring Agricultural Machinery"
BOH_tip_top_tractors_desc:0 "As time progresses, technology does too. Tractors, preferably domestic, need to be available for consumers. Atop these modern iron beasts of burden, we shall till the fertile soil and bring natural-born prosperity to our nation while making the jobs of our beloved farmers all the easier."
BOH_rural_resources:0 "Exploit Our Land"
BOH_rural_resources_desc:0 "Bohemia is the industrial kingdom of Austria-Hungary, or it could be if our domestic industry wasn’t so maladapted to suit the needs of Vienna over our own. We have plenty of untapped resources, and it is time to finally rectify those wrongs. We shall dig deep into the ground and unearth the natural bounty that lies beneath our feet, bringing fortunes and mineral wealth to our people and our nation over all others."
BOH_secure_press_support:0 "Steal Press Support"
BOH_secure_press_support_desc:0 "While we did win the election, the Realists still hold a plurality over the media. We need to compete with their dominance one way or another. Through the exchange of funds or even blackmail, we shall begin to twist the venomous serpent that is the media around our own finger, turning the press from a liability to our regime into a weapon for it."
BOH_seek_internal_allies:0 "Allies in the Diet"
BOH_seek_internal_allies_desc:0 "To pass motions and build a strong coalition, allies must be sought in the wider Bohemian Diet. Through compromise and non-partisanship, we shall build a powerful enough support base that we can finally exert the full ambitions of our party through legislation."
BOH_work_with_bund_der_landwirte:0 "Meet with the Bund der Landwirte"
BOH_work_with_bund_der_landwirte_desc:0 "The Bund der Landwirte is a German political party with close ties to our own RSZML, with both of our parties prioritizing agriculturalism and the livelihood of the peasantry. Cooperation with them will surely bring us nothing but stability, helping in small part to aid the German Bohemian issue. It also certainly helps that we already have a close relationship to the Bund, and as such this cooperation is expected to go along swimmingly."
BOH_supply_skoda_works:0 "Supply Škoda Works"
BOH_supply_skoda_works_desc:0 "With the first of our new resource extraction initiatives going along swimmingly, now comes the time to put this raw mineral wealth to good use. Skoda Works, one of the largest industrial companies in our nation, needs to be fueled with resources, and now we can supply them near endlessly with natively sourced materials. As their furnaces fire and their foundries churn, the abundance of resources we extract shall go directly to Škoda and other companies like it, improving both our economy and our military capabilities."
BOH_red_green_coalition:0 "Continuation of the Red-Green Coalition"
BOH_red_green_coalition_desc:0 "Since the Pardoners' Agreement, one of Bohemia's prevailing coalitions has been the Red-Green Coalition. It persists now, and must continue this bastion of bipartisan cooperation, for without these Reds aiding us in the legislature, we surely will not be able to pass the policies and plans we have in store for our great nation."
BOH_a_bohemian_solution:0 "The Bohemian Solution"
BOH_a_bohemian_solution_desc:0 "Developments with the BdL and government policies have calmed tensions significantly across the border regions between the local Czechs and the German Bohemians for now. Due to these developments, an unheard of level of ethnic peace has spread throughout the hinterlands, and our nation truly heals as a result. However, despite all this work, things are still tense between our people and the German Bohemians, and you never know what the future might hold in store for us..."
BOH_small_business_support:0 "Protect Individual Business"
BOH_small_business_support_desc:0 "Corporations like Škoda have their merits, but the primary unit of business should be the small owners' shops. Small business and local entrepreneurialism is key to building not only our economy up, but also to creating a true middle class while also uplifting the peasantry. Our corporations shall still be allowed to operate and still be allowed to serve as the foundation of our economic system, but they shall be kept in check so that the true nucleus of the economy - our small businesses - is allowed to flourish."
BOH_insurance_program:0 "A Peasant's Insurance"
BOH_insurance_program_desc:0 "A poor harvest is not always the farmers' fault, and in that event, plus many more always possible and ever-looming scenarios, people need to be able to continue their way of life. We shall not punish our farmers for the bad hands nature or God deals to them, and so a fund shall be established, pulled from taxes and various fees the farmers already pay, so that our farmers - the pride of the nation - have a safetynet to fall upon in hard times. We will always be there to help pick them off their feet."

BOH_realist_victory_desc:0 "The expected winners of the election, the Česká strana pokroková - or Czech Progressive Party and more commonly called the Realists - under Benes, have taken the mantle of power. Benes already basically ran the nation as Masaryk was too ill to carry out the functions of state, but now he rules in name as well as in function. With the heirs of Masaryk at the helm, that status quo is expected to be continued as the final wishes of our national father are carried out."
BOH_mandate_of_democracy:0 "Mandate of Democracy"
BOH_mandate_of_democracy_desc:0 "Until 1926 the Kaiser scorned Bohemian democracy and only accepted it when he was forced to. Given the chance he would undermine it without another thought. We must uphold Bohemian democracy not only as an example to ourselves, but as an example to the world."
BOH_the_great_compromiser:0 "The Great Compromiser"
BOH_the_great_compromiser_desc:0 "Benes is a man of words, great words, the best words in fact. While he ran the state in Masaryk's stead he became known as the Great Compromiser for his magnificent efforts in diplomacy, able to find middle ground where many assumed none existed. These talents will be mighty valuable to him and his administration."
BOH_against_the_reds:0 "Resist the Radical Reds"
BOH_against_the_reds_desc:0 "Despite his great reputation for diplomacy there is one group that Benes will not abide by, Syndicalists. If you give them a meter they will take a kilometer. To save Bohemian democracy from revolutionary Syndicalism the Red Cancer will have to be cut out."
BOH_secure_diet_support:0 "Monopoly over the Diet"
BOH_secure_diet_support_desc:0 "While the Realists have a significant media presence there are worryingly few who agree with us completely in the Diet. If we are to save Bohemia we must bring the Diet under control through savvy deals and realistic compromise."
BOH_meet_with_german_representatives:0 "Meet with German Representatives"
BOH_meet_with_german_representatives_desc:0 "To the German-Bohemians the election of Benes was the continuation of a system they already hated. However, while the population might reject us, the politicians are always easier to influence. If we reach an agreement with these politicians then maybe they can snuff out the fires at home."
BOH_expand_castle_influence:0 "Expand the Castle's Influence"
BOH_expand_castle_influence_desc:0 "The Castle, the name for our propaganda arm operating out of Prague Castle, has a wide reaching influence on Czech media. However many new innovations like radio and movies remain outside our view. If we are to effectively manage our image then we must expand our reach."
BOH_export_industry:0 "Market the Modřany Sugar Factory"
BOH_export_industry_desc:0 "Bohemia is the home of European sugar production and has been for centuries. As a staple of much of Europe’s tables, if we were to open a new and expansive sugar factory, say in the Prague suburb of Modrany, then we can exploit Europe’s sweet tooth for our own profit."
BOH_independent_economy:0 "Melt the Economic Chains"
BOH_independent_economy_desc:0 "At the moment Bohemia’s economy is built on a foundation laid by Vienna. Any move for freedom could be countered by the Kaiser pulling the rug out from under us economically. We must reach out to Berlin and even Warsaw and build new economic ties not bound by the fickle whims of a far off monarch."
BOH_rights_of_women:0 "Women's Franchise"
BOH_rights_of_women_desc:0 "Masaryk was famously a defendant in the Hilsner trial, and in turn a vocal and active proponent for women's rights. We must further his cause to its rightful conclusion and give women the vote they so deserve. The fact that it would secure for us a large voting bloc for the foreseeable future is just icing on the cake."
BOH_facts_dont_care:0 "Facts Don't Care About your Feelings"
BOH_facts_dont_care_desc:0 "Some call us cold, others call us ruthless and still others call us uncaring. We call ourselves realists. We don't need their praise when we have the results to vindicate us. We are not cold and uncaring monsters. We are Realists and we are just what Bohemia needs."
BOH_nationalistic_rhetoric:0 "Nationalistic Rhetoric"
BOH_nationalistic_rhetoric_desc:0 "There are still those within Bohemia that hold out hope that the Kaiser will save us from our woes. We must prove them wrong. With the facts behind us even the most stubborn and committed monarchist couldn't help but begin to doubt and Benes can make even a hairline fracture of doubt into a canyon."
BOH_anti_clericalism:0 "Fight Clericalist Elements"
BOH_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "Bohemia is a religious nation, or was at the very least, and as such there are quite a few men of god within the Diet who all clamor for the return of God to our national politic. This is quite frankly moronic and Benes will let everybody know why."
BOH_worker_welfare:0 "Workers' Welfare"
BOH_worker_welfare_desc:0 "Benes cares for all Bohemians and it pains him that so many have been forced onto the streets by Black Monday. The Bohemian common man must be saved lest his desperation turn him to radicalism and plunge us into anarchy."
BOH_our_interests_first:0 "Bohemian Interests Foremost"
BOH_our_interests_first_desc:0 "As far as Kaiser Karel is concerned all the constituent kingdoms of the Empire must work for the betterment of Austria so that their work may be rewarded...in time.

BOH_democratization_procedures:0 "Process of Democratization"
BOH_democratization_procedures_desc:0 "Our government, while a democracy, is still heavily caged by the Austrians. However the Kaiser and us agree for once that it can't last like this if the Kaiser’s grand vision of a ‘Danubian Federation’ is to succeed. We will work with him to further his vision of the Federation, if only to loosen the vice grip on ourselves."
BOH_defense_of_rights:0 "Defense of Freedom"
BOH_defense_of_rights_desc:0 "The Americans were right when they said that all men were guaranteed the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Unlike the Americans, we here in Bohemia will realize that right for all our citizens and defend that right as we would any other."

BOH_summit_with_agrarians_desc:0 "Word has reached Benes that the Agrarians and the Social Democrats are in talks for a coalition.

BOH_christian_social_victory_desc:0 "In a victory few expected, the Christian Socialists of the ČSL - or Česká strana lidová - have managed to eke out a victory. However, these conservatives of the ‘People’s Party’ are assailed on all sides by forces outside their control. They must act quickly if they are to lead Bohemia to greatness."
BOH_industrial_engineering:0 "Škoda Works Engineers"

BOH_vanguard_of_conservatism_desc:0 "Bohemia has seen a surge of liberalism lately and a turn away from God and Conservatism. This must be reversed if the nation is to avoid anarchy and degeneracy."
BOH_assistance_from_austria:0 "Aid from Vienna"
BOH_assistance_from_austria_desc:0 "In Vienna sits mountains of resources that the Austrians do nothing with. So, they sit there and rot rather than be put to good use. We must reach out to the Kaiser and acquire as much of this excess as possible."

BOH_classist_system:0 "Classist Systematics"
BOH_classist_system_desc:0 "Many leftists disavow class as a reason for oppression and wish to break them down. This is the wrong view. The capitalist made his money through hard work, grit and determination mopping floors and taking several jobs as a young man. Now in his old age his hard work is being rewarded. To encourage the lazy youths to work as hard as their forefathers we shall further reward them."
BOH_preserve_the_church:0 "Reaffirm Papal Relations"
BOH_preserve_the_church_desc:0 "Many other parties have at best been neutral on the status of the church or, in the case of the liberals and Syndicalists, have sought to distance our nation from God's representative on Earth. We must rectify this and draw Bohemia closer to the Church if we are to reap the rewards of God's blessings."
BOH_business_nonintervention:0 "Business Non-Intervention"
BOH_business_nonintervention_desc:0 "The free market determines who survives. If we prop up failing businesses now then they will just fail again later.

BOH_welfarism:0 "Implement Bohemian Welfarism"
BOH_welfarism_desc:0 "The people cry out for help and God demands charity from his subjects. In the name of Christian charity we will give the poor and unemployed insurance to keep them off the streets. Not enough that they will feel tempted to live on it indefinitely mind you, but enough to keep them from starving."
BOH_only_when_in_czech_interest:0 "...Except in Czech Interests"
BOH_only_when_in_czech_interest_desc:0 "While we do believe in the free market, leaving it totally hands off could only lead to trouble in the long run.

BOH_mutual_discrimination_prevention_agreement:0 "Discrimination Prevention Agreement"
BOH_mutual_discrimination_prevention_agreement_desc:0 "Many Bohemians are wary of the German-Bohemians. They discriminate against them openly and brazenly without fear of repercussion and many have found themselves shut out of power. This must come to an end if social harmony is to be maintained."

BOH_protectionism:0 "Protectionist Policies"
BOH_protectionism_desc:0 "Czech industry is mighty yet still vulnerable. Major multinational companies could easily undercut it and take over our economy in price wars local companies couldn’t possibly win. To stop this threat we will institute strict tariffs to protect our industry and nurture it until it can stand on its own. Some say this will only hurt us in the long run, we cannot wait to see them proven wrong."
BOH_language_integrations:0 "Linguistic Integrations"
BOH_language_integrations_desc:0 "Bohemia is a land of many languages with the main ones being Czech and German. In German dominated areas like the Sudetenland many road signs and books are written exclusively in German, while in the rest of Bohemia the same holds for Czech. To help the two communities intermingle more we shall mandate the use of Czech and German both across the nation on all official buildings, documents and signs."

BOH_territorial_assembly_desc:0 "Who knows how to run things like a person who lives there?

BOH_strictly_bohemian_weapons_desc:0 "The native Czech arms industry is miniscule and dominated by foreign companies.

BOH_tax_income:0 "Income via Taxes"
BOH_tax_income_desc:0 "Our predecessors kept taxes low to please the populace while neglecting the fact a lot of state income should come from taxes. We shall raise the taxes on most things by a slight amount, about 1% or so, which should bring in a new influx of cash to our treasury.

BOH_suppress_pangermanism_desc:0 "A rot infests Bohemia worse than the dirty Syndicalists, Pan-Germanists.

BOH_diplomatic_approach:0 "The Diplomatic Approach"
BOH_diplomatic_approach_desc:0 "When the Bohemians and Pan-Germanists bicker and fight, only Vienna profits. Together however we can achieve much. WIth their more radical members marginalized we should reach out a hand and unite with our wayward kin and bring them into our new nation."

bdeboh.0.t:0 "The Lands of the Bohemian Crown in 1936"
bdeboh.0.d:0 "The Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia, commonly known as just 'Bohemia', lies in the center of Habsburg interest. Reportedly Kaiser Karel I's favorite out of the constituents, and a leading industrial manufacturer for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bohemia has seen its fair share of Habsburg oversight and nationalist scuffles. Ever since the Weltkrieg began, the Czechs of Bohemia sought a way to leave. Whether this was by supporting the domestic resistance, the Maffie, or by joining the Czechoslovak Legions and Sokol militants, the Czechs fought tooth and nail, with personalities such as Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, or Milan Rastislav Štefánik at the head of the Czechoslovak idea.\n\nWhen it became evident to these wanted men that Germany was en route to a total victory, many of the men fled to the Upper East Neighborhood of Manhattan, continuing an unrecognized Czechoslovak government-in-exile. As time passed, however, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile gradually degraded into both a Czech and Slovak government, headed by the two paragons of Czechoslovakism. However, the idea still holds their hearts.\n\nAt home, Bohemia went through a period of internal stability as the K.u.K. troops cleared out Maffie resistance. Meanwhile, the sympathetic ČSDSD and ČSL began close cooperation with Vienna, consistently dominating the local elections as Kaiser Karl tightened his gauntlet around Prague.\n\nIn 1924, Kaiser Karel I declared his intention to be crowned King of Bohemia, resulting in mass protest throughout Bohemia and Moravia. However, this outrage from the Czechs was not reciprocated in German-majority regions. Thus, a ridge between the Czechs and Germans began to take shape, only widening as the coronation successfully took place, cementing Kaiser Karel as holder of the Wenzelkrone. However, the outrage only grew, resulting in a Maffie resurgence. K.u.K. troops were shot at and harassed by small partisan bands, actions that only spread the word of the Bohemian Crisis further down into the empire. Down in the kingdoms of Croatia-Slavonia, and Bosnia, the words resonated within minds that understood the Czechs, and thus what was happening in Bohemia began to happen in the Southern Slavic nations.\n\nMeanwhile, in Bohemia, the riots were at a breaking point. Kaiser Karel I struck a popular deal with the rioters - pardon the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, institute democratic reforms, and allow the Czechs a larger role in government, and they would cease. Fortunately, this was almost exactly what the Kaiser wanted. He was finally pushing forth a federation, whether Hungary liked it or not.\nThus, in 1926, the Pardoners' Agreement was struck, and in the first election that occurred two years afterward, T.G. Masaryk and his student Edvard Beneš won a historic landslide, crushing the ruling ČSDSD. The Agrarians and National Democrats similarly cleaved away large swaths of the Diet, putting the ČSL and ČSDSD's long duumvirate at an end. Masaryk began to clear up the lines that the Pardoners' Agreement left blurry, instituting autonomy for the increasingly restless German-Bohemia, who viewed Prague as oppressive, and wanted more direct rule from Vienna, not a foreign Slavic capital.\n\nSince that election, eight long years have passed, resulting in Masaryk's re-election in 1932. Many see Masaryk's death as imminent, as last year Beneš was called in to lead the nation in Masaryk's bouts of illness.\nNevertheless, not all is fine for Bohemia - it is a common secret that many still aspire for Czechoslovakia, or a free Czech nation. The German-Bohemians have begun to radicalize, and the fires of war loom on the horizon westwards. But even then, Bohemia remains hopeful - hopeful that truth will prevail, as it always has before."

bdeboh.1.d:0 "All of Bohemia mourns today, for on [GetDateText], news broke from Prague Castle of the long-coming demise of T.G. Masaryk. He had been bedridden as of the prior few months and ill for years now, but always able to work for Bohemia and its people, appearing last month to them.\nSince his stroke in 1934, during a cordial meeting with Kaiser Karl in gardens of Prague Castle, the omens have been hanging in the stars every night; brighter each moon. Beneš has exercised an increasing role in governorship, with him being the de facto governor of Bohemia; carrying out Masaryk's requests and orders from his residence at Lany Castle. An unparalleled state funeral is to be held next week, and a period of national mourning has been declared by Edvard Beneš, the new temporary governor.\nIn Vienna, Kaiser Karl personally gave condolences to Beneš and Jan Masaryk; furthermore to Bohemia at large. The flags at Vienna are to be flown at half-mast for the week until the funeral, and a Bohemian flag raised alongside.\nPrague has been eerily silent come the news; only the sound of man's creations and endeavours can be heard throughout every avenue of the great city. Red roses adorn men and women's coats, and wreaths decorate businesses; all symbols of the immeasurable respect Masaryk attained from his people. The man to successfully bring Czech culture into Imperial life, to fight for his people and pursue a Czech future, the Grand Old Man of the Empire, will be remembered forever by the Czech people."
bdeboh.1.a:0 "Elections so soon..."

bdeboh.2.t:0 "Candidate for the National Democrats"
bdeboh.2.d:0 "Two major candidates are running in the National Democrats primary. The first is František Mareš, a nationalist and long-time party activist, who has vowed to do everything possible to uphold Czech culture and preserve the nation. In addition to being a politician, he is also a brilliant professor of physiology and philosophy. The second possible candidate is Jiří Stříbrný, a charismatic politician who dreams of a free Czech nation for its people. Some in the party criticize, however, the fact that Stříbrný was allegedly influenced by legionary movements such as the Iron Guard in Romania or the ANI in Italy. The primaries are expected to be close between the two men, but a final choice must be made."
bdeboh.2.a:0 "František Mareš is the man for the job!"
bdeboh.2.b:0 "Jiří Stříbrný, for a Czech nation!"

bdeboh.3.t:0 "Candidate for Social-Democrats"
bdeboh.3.d:0 "Today the Social Democrats delegates are meeting in order to elect a representative to participate in the upcoming elections. As it is now, there are two main candidates. The first one is František Soukup, a long-time party member, who has a lot of political experience, having participated in the internal resistance during the Weltkrieg, and who is also a distinguished writer, poet and journalist. The second possible choice is Antonín Hampl, known for his participation in the social-democratic trade union movement and as a former secretary of the Metalworkers' Union, he has always defended the interests of Czech workers and intends to continue doing so if elected governor. After much deliberation a candidate was finally chosen."
bdeboh.3.a:0 "Antonín Hampl will defend the Czech workers!"
bdeboh.3.b:0 "The venerable František Soukup is the man the people need!"

bdeboh.4.t:0 "Candidate for the Agrarians"
bdeboh.4.d:0 "The Agrarians will decide today on a candidate for the upcoming elections, with two main choices available to them. The first one is Jan Malypetr, coming from a family of rich landowners from Central Bohemia. After many years of studying, he developed a particular talent in economics which he showed well during his time managing a sugar refinery before entering politics. A vocal opponent to partisan politics and an able, experienced diplomat, Malypetr is certainly qualified to be governor. \n\nThe second candidate is Rudolf Beran, who, unlike Malypetr, comes from a modest family with no elevated background or social standing. Beran founded the 'Czech Heart' during the Weltkrieg, a movement that fights against hunger and poverty across the nation, and is a fervent defender of agrarian interests and the downtrodden. However, Beran has also been accused of anti-Semitism by political opponents and even by some fellow party members, though he categorically denies these accusations in any public setting. Despite their differing backgrounds, both men stand as devoted Agrarians, and both are wholly dedicated to ushering in the ‘Green Dream’ to our Bohemia."

With the people of [tag.getname] now placing their votes so that their voices may be heard, a new democratically supported mandate shall soon sweep the nation. The five major parties have all campaigned hard for a chance to rule and despite initial predictions of a Realist sweep, preliminary results tell a tale of a perilously close election. As the votes are counted however, one victor has risen to the top of the pile, and as newsmen and media moguls around the nation prepare to announce the winner, it is finally confirmed that..."

bdeboh.6.d:0 "Black Monday, the economic catastrophe that has ravaged not only Berlin’s economy but the wider world at large, has finally spread to our Bohemia. Across the nation, businesses are closing, banks are failing, and people are losing savings in an instant, all the while the lines of the unemployed and unhoused grow ever longer in every city and settlement in our state. Our government has been sent reeling from this tremendous shock but one thing remains clear: we must do something!"
bdeboh.6.a:0 "What of the kolaches?!"

bdeboh.7.t:0 "Fate of the Kingdom of Bohemia"
bdeboh.7.d:0 "When it comes to the fate of the Kingdom of Bohemia, there are two main proposals that have nearly torn the country in two as to how our state shall develop. The debate has largely coalesced around those who desire a true Bohemian kingdom - one now free of Austrian meddling and with a true Bohemian on the throne - and those whose desire a republic - those as to how they republic should form is a debate in itself. Within the varied Republican camp, parties argue as to how close we should remain to Vienna and as to what policy we would support, but such questions are best left up to the people and elections - that is if a republic is even formed. If the Kingdom is kept, two main candidates for King have arisen, shifting the destiny of the Wenzelkrone to either the House of Lobkowicz under Maximillian and the House of Schwartzenberg under Adolph. Whatever our final decision and with bickering groups and dissenters voicing their complaints more each day, the future of Bohemia shall never be the same."
bdeboh.7.a:0 "We shall pass the Wenzelkrone on to a true Bohemian."
bdeboh.7.b:0 "Down with the Crown! Long live the Republic!"

bdeboh.8.t:0 "A Hussite Threat"
bdeboh.8.d:0 "The Hussite Church has found our approach to clericalism unsatisfying and reprehensible, despite the reality being that we officially disavow clericalism in its entirety. It seems that many men simply don't do their research or merely follow the will of a few loud firebrands, and the Hussites have capitalized on this ignorance, threatening to oust Sramek lest he yield to their concerns. Heading the modern Hussite movement, František Michalek Bartos and Gustav Adolf Procházka have come out calling for our national capitulation as champions of Jan Hus’ ideals and original message. Gustav Adolf Procházka is a respected minister and the second ever Patriarch to the Hussite Church, and calls for a Hussitic monarchy, while František Michalek Bartos is a scholar and the main thinker of the modern Hussite movement, calling for a cleansed and restricted republic based on Jan Hus’ teachings. With their influence only growing, we must act quick and stamp out this movement lest these religious radicals sweep the nation."
bdeboh.8.a:0 "Give into Bartos."
bdeboh.8.b:0 "Give into Patriarch Procházka."
bdeboh.8.c:0 "No deal, Hus. Back to the pages of history with you nuts!"

bdeboh.9.t:0 "The Next King"
bdeboh.9.d:0 "With a Kingdom comes a King, and with the Wenzelkrone now needing to find a true Bohemian to bear its regality, two noble families have risen to fit the bill. One is the House of Schwarzenberg - headed by Adolf Schwarzenberg - and the other is the House of Lobkowicz - headed by Maximilian Erwin Lobkowicz. With the debate within our administration raging as to which noble should rise to don the Wenzelkrone, an internal vote to ‘elect’ a King has been held. Both holding different views for how the Kingdom should be organized, Adolf and Maximillian have been fiercely campaigning and debating for weeks, but finally after many arguments were held and after the votes have been counted, it has become clear that the true and mandated King of Bohemia shall be..."
bdeboh.9.a:0 "Maximilian I von Lobkowicz! May the House of Lobkowicz guide us!"
bdeboh.9.b:0 "Adolf I von Schwarzenberg! May the House of Schwarzenberg see us through!"

bdeboh.10.t:0 "Crowning of the King of Bohemia"
bdeboh.10.d:0 "With a King finally chosen, the halls of Prague Castle have been cleared and redecorated for the occasion. Velvetine drapery and illustrious Bohemian artwork has been hung up around the castle’s main hall in preparation for the ceremony. Matching this majesty, glittering in gold and studded with numerous illustrious gems and crystals, the honored Wenzelkrone would soon find its new place atop the head of our new King. Locked away at the core of the castle within a large iron safe barred with seven locks, the Wenzelkrone - atop its plushy crimson pillow and with its accompanying scepter and globus cruciger - were retrieved by the seven most trusted men in the nation - each a prominent member of our Church or our State entrusted to hold one of the seven keys. \n\nWith the crown retrieved, the coronation ceremony could finally begin. As commoners and peasants crowded outside the castle trying to catch even just a glimpse of the opulence inside, the central hall was packed full of clergymen, nobles, captains of industry, prominent government officials, and many other guests of note - including even some foreign monarchs who have come to pay respect to their new fellow royal. As our new king walked up the central aisle as organs played the ‘Saint Wenceslas Chorale’ and ‘Hospodine, Pomiluj Ny’ ’while frankincense burned, the Patriarch of our Church began his sermon before the Wenzelkrone was finally lifted from its plush pillow and placed upon its new rightful wearer. Draped in regalia with the Wenzelkrone donned, and with scepter and sovereign’s orb in hand, our new and truly Bohemian king has finally risen to become sovereign and suzerin of our newly rebirthed Kingdom."
bdeboh.10.a:0 "A new, truly Bohemian Kingdom to last a thousand years!"

bdeboh.11.t:0 "Hus' Coup"
bdeboh.11.d:0 "The threats by the Hussite Church regarding our false clericalism have reached a boiling point, and the nation now is torn apart by the throes of these rebels. What started out as yet another protest of yammering Hussites and bickering clergymen has spiralled out of control after police involvement, and now a small but determined band of irregulars and ‘Hussite militiamen’ have seized the government quarters in Prague. Taking Jan Sramek prisoner and declaring a Hussite state, free of Catholic chains, these irregulars - largely led by Hussite scholar František Michalek Bartos and Patriarch Gustav Adolf Procházka - have barred themselves in the capital compound and now have begun to consolidate their hold on Prague. With more and more upset peasants and disgruntled commoners joining their ranks each day, it would seem that the old regime’s days are numbered. Soon, Bohemia truly will be a Hussite State."
bdeboh.11.a:0 "Jan Hus and 1419 have finally been avenged!"

bdecze.1.t:0 "Agrarian Candidacy"
bdecze.1.d:0 "With the next election looming, and with the addition of the Slovaks to the electoral strategy, the Agrarians and their internal debate on who should lead the party in this new term have come to a head. The main two candidates standing any chance of leading the party are Jan Malypetr and Milan Hodza. Malypetr - a Czech known for his federalist and isolationist tendencies - stands as the frontrunner of the debate. However, Hodza - a Slovak who has risen to public prominence on his platform of ‘Green Internationalism’ while stressing the need for cooperation has won the hearts of many. Who will lead the Agrarians during the second election?"
bdecze.1.a:0 "Jan Malypetr shall lead us into a bright future!"
bdecze.1.b:0 "Milan Hodza will guide us towards our Green destiny!"

bdecze.2.t:0 "National Socialist Candidacy"
bdecze.2.d:0 "As the term of this first free electoral cycle draws to a close, Edvard Beneš still reigns over [CZE.GetAdjective]. Leading the National Socialist party through thick and thin, Prime Minister Beneš has attracted as many new allies as he has enemies. In a bid to reshuffle the party and to save face, some within our ranks have suggested that Beneš should step down as party leader for this coming term. In his place, these detractors have named Jan Masaryk, son of our national father, as a replacement candidate. Similar in beliefs and policy, these two titans of the national scene would each make a fine leader to guide us through these next elections. However, only one can truly rule as PM, so who shall we choose?"
bdecze.2.a:0 "Edvard Beneš shall continue his tenure."
bdecze.2.b:0 "Jan Masaryk shall follow his father."

bdecze.3.t:0 "Austrian Industries Pull Out"
bdecze.3.d:0 "Our Revolution has proven successful, but at a great cost to our economic prowess. As Bohemia once sat as the primary holder of Austro-Hungarian industrial prowess, the onset of the Revolution has prompted all Austrian businesses and corporations to leave Bohemia, in an effort to strike its economy. With these mass withdrawals, our financial system has begun to destabilize and hemorrhage as if it were Black Monday all over again"

The two main faces claiming to know what is best for the future of both the party and the nation are current party head Antonin Hampl and the upstart firebrand Vojta Beneš. Beneš has been gaining an upper hand in politics recently with his fiery nationalist rhetoric. An active proponent of Czech independence and national rebirth, Beneš has come to blows with Hampl over the latter’s seemingly weak stance towards Vienna, but many still stand by Hampl for the good work he has done as party leader these past few years. However, there can be only one face of the party, and with debate still raging, it is truly anyone’s race."

Despite earning only around 5000 votes back then, its program was quite extensive. Calling for mandatory alcoholism through brewery expansion, wealth redistribution to the needy so that all can afford ‘pocket aquariums’, anti-clericalism, ‘slavery’ in the form of government mandated work schedules, and many other obscure and mismatched policies that largely we jokes poking fun at the democratic process, the party was largely mocked and ignored. However, its original founder Jaroslav Hašek - famed author and drunkard - has announced that the party shall be reforming in order to run in the election of 1942. Though they hold little chance of winning and most in the nation find them laughable at the least, that has not stopped Hašek from beginning to amass as much support as possible on a pub tour across the nation.

bdecze.11.d: "A socialist protest largely organized by Syndicalist firebrand Antonín Zápotocký has erupted into open clashes in Prague. What started out as just a simple and common protest against the anti-Socialist ban on elections has spiralled out of control after a young college student in the protest line began to brawl with a local security officer. With hundreds now joining in on the chaos, the simple protest has risen to include scores of our population, with smaller riots breaking out across Prague as a result. Outgunned and mostly unarmed, the main body of the rioters have begun hiding behind children, attempting to use them as human shields while they raid local storefronts for weapons to use against the armed police, believing that our police wouldn’t dare fire on children. Despite notable feminist and moderate Syndicalist Luisa Landová-Štychová attempting to cool the situation within the Socialist camp, tensions have flared and the riot is verging on becoming a full-on example of revolutionary fervor. With government reinforcements arriving on the scene armed and ready to do what must be done, it is now on us to give the final order. Should we fire on these Socialist vermin, risking the lives of innocent children but stopping this riot before it gets too large to stop, or should we try to wait it out and hope their anger dies out?"

Taking his place as Patriarch of the Hussite Church is František Kovář.

Though we acted entirely within our right as the protectors of this nation and were only trying to prevent a Socialist Revolution from coalescing, the tragic spilling of infantile blood has stained our hands and our reputation. It will take a PR miracle and monumental effort to remove all this red from our ledger, but we shall not let this black mark besmirch everything we have worked for. Let them call us child-killers and infant-murderers, for we and our loyalists know the truth: we did what was necessary to save our nation and our people."

These vile Socialists, Syndicalists, and Totalists have worked together to amass a ragtag but dedicated militia, and using brute-force tactics and the element of surprise, they have seized everything but the presidential chambers. With governmental forces spread thin but enroute, and with the moderate Syndicalist Luisa Landová-Štychová threatening to splinter away from Zápotocký’s over his harsh methods to take power for herself and her moderates, the future of the nation precariously hangs in the balance."

For the most part throughout recent history, the relations between these peoples and the majority Czech population has been calm. On the other hand, there are also the Bohemian Germans - Sudetendeutsche - who often live close to the borders. Following Germany’s victory in the Weltkrieg, there has been a flicker of nationalist pride amongst the Bohemian Germans, fostered by the fear of Czech nationalism that supposedly seeks to keep the Sudetendeutsche under their heels.

We have therefore decided to implement a more straightforward method - by enticing Czechs with monetary bonuses to move into the Sudety, or as they refer to as the Sudetenland. Once these farmers are settled, they will be provided with government aid in order to outperform the Bohemian-Germans at their own agricultural games. Of course, it’s important to maintain good relations with the Sudentendeutche - we wouldn’t want a revolt on our hands as a result of this operation."

Instead, this power would be transferred to the farmers and lower class citizens. The debate has so far been headed by Antonin Hampl and Soukup, both fiercely defending the bill and debating the consequences and potential of the law as champions of the ‘Red’ side of the coalition.\n\nThe biggest opponent faced by the ‘Reds’ and their moderate Green allies in the coalition is none other than the large industrialist clique within the Greens - our RSZML. These less-dedicated Agrarians ardently oppose the Baron Bill on behalf of their ally, Škoda Works, which the law would heavily effect if it were to pass.

A fanciful cartoon tale of love and a hero’s journey, the film features a pair of fish getting married. As the two fish prepare for their big day, without warning or remorse a devilish octopus captures the bride - a pale fish in stark contrast to the groom fish’s black scales - and runs away with her to his dark cavern in the abyss. The groom fish, distraught but internally burning with vengeance, then travels the Coral Sea to recruit fellow marine life to help him in his noble cause. After amassing a large posse of various denizens of the deep, the groom fish and his small army make their way to the evil octopus’s lair. With an army at his back, the noble groom fish challenges the octopus to single combat - a true showing of chivalry and honor. After a brawl and a scuffle, the villain that is the octopus is defeated by the groom fish, who then is able to free his bride-to-be so that their wedding may finally commence. In true heroic fashion and with their love saved and steeled, the film ends with the groom and bride fishes riding off together into the sunset atop the back of a friendly sea turtle. A fanciful adventure of love and comedy, the short film - at only around 11 minutes long - has been an absolute hit with children across the nation, cementing Brdečka and Pojar as two of the most famous cartoonists in the country."

Brdečka has released another animated film, this time about a Czech chimney sweep turned partisan disguised as a Spring-heeled Jack-like figure. Wearing spring-filled shoes, the mischievous hero nicknamed ‘Springer’ dons a black outfit with a mask made from old socks, defying curfew and thwarts the actions of a KuK informant and his incompetent goons that ends in a surrealistic, slapstick chase across a dark and smoggy Prague. Despite its somewhat controversial material, it remains inoffensive in its portrayal of violence and has once again been popular amongst the youth. Though Vienna has taken issue with some of the film’s contents - claiming that it portrays them in a villainous light - Brdečka has assured all it is merely satire."

One of the most beloved classic children’s books in the nation, it was first published anonymously in 1876 by a Calvinist clergyman under the title ‘Broučci pro malé i velké děti’ - or Fireflies for Big and Small Children. The book largely was published without fame or acclaim, until it was rediscovered and popularized in 1893 by famous publicist Gustav Jaroš - who famously called it ‘perhaps the most beautiful blossom of Czech children literature.’ Since then, the novel has been published again and again, becoming one of the most popular books for children in our lexicon despite minor controversy rising against its alleged themes of moralistic conservatism and death. \n\nThe story follows a young firefly-nymph boy named Adamek as he learns courage and integrity while atoning for his bad deeds by saving a 7 year old boy from a spider. After saving the boy, he wakes with the actions he had done being revealed to be just a dream. Despite the immaterial nature of his heroic acts, Adamek resolves himself to keep true to the lessons taught in his dream and becomes a better person for it. After the turbulent times in places like the United States, the English translation of the book has seen great success and popularity in bookstores across the country and beyond, with it becoming a best-seller in places such as America, Australasia, South Africa, and even England and Canada as the Anglo world regardless of ideological conviction gobble up this quaint and peaceful story - perhaps as just a temporary respite or distraction from the growing horrors that consume the world stage."

The six sequences are: Shrovetide, Spring, Legend About St. Prokop, The Fair, The Feast, and finally Bethlehem, with each offering a different window into Czech country life and the wonderful tales common in our villages and hinterlands.

Some of these artifacts are made of ivory and some are of women, mostly thought to be representations of goddesses though more study is necessary but most are of animals from the time. One of these women, carved in black stone, has been dubbed the Black Venus while the second is being called the Venus of Dolni Vestonice.

Their way of life revolves around taking the harvest to nearby cities, including Prague. However, on one faithful evening, a strange hum filled the air - many out on the fields looked over beyond the hills and saw an aircraft bearing KuK markings. Although puzzling, they continued watching the lone aircraft continue its journey. By the time it disappeared, many of the villagers had returned to work. Several minutes later, a faint sound similar to thunder cracked in the distance. Smoke was also seen in the distance. Concerned, several villagers ventured out looking for signs of wreckage. Late into the evening, some members of a search party found a crater in the surrounding hills of the quarry and what appeared to be an entry into the Earth; bewildered, they entered and searched for any signs of distress. Nearly getting lost themselves, they uncovered a vast plethora of passages, chambers, formations, and even roses sculpted from limestone. Accompanying the caves were thousands of prehistoric animals and even prehistoric human bones. The find has surprised the European scientific community, and several governments have gifted Koněprusy generous funding to their humble village. It was later reported that the lone aircraft was separated during an exercise that had dropped its payload prematurely."

As the discovery spreads, the newts are first enslaved and pressed into service as pearl farmers, being spread around the vast oceans as slaves and laborers. As the newts adopt human culture, they begin to resent their captors and evolve more completely. Eventually, the newts submit to their desire to spread, and begin colonizing and expanding the world’s coastlines, satirizing the imperialism of the British, French, and Germans. In time, the newts grow in strength and rebel, with the last four chapters of the book - of its total 27 - describing the bloody conflict.Finally, the book ends with the newts defeating humanity and enslaving them in return. As the last chapter ends, the newts fall prey to humanity's same follies, and humanity once again inherits Earth, as America and the Old World before the rise of the salamanders fades into obscurity as a mythical land. \n\nThe book has been universally beloved, but has received criticisms for its odd nature and political undertones. It also recieved some hate from various conservative groups over Čapek’s inclusion of a section titled ‘The Sex Life of the Newts,’ which details the anatomy and reproductive methods of the fictional creatures in explicit detail as a satirical parody of the natural sciences. Despite these quirks, the book is flying off the shelves as Karel Čapek - Mr. ‘Robot’ himself - earns himself another best-seller."

However, as he walked he suddenly found himself stuck in place. A part of him wanted to keep walking but he was unable to. As he looked around to get his bearings he saw what made his body involuntarily halt. In front of him at the far end of the street sat a ghostly figure clad in magnificent Templar armor atop a white horse with no legs. The armored man took no notice of Sramek as he slowly clopped his horse up the street. As he approached Sramek noticed that he was headless, with his head, mercifully still in its helmet, sitting under his right arm. The apparition approached him wordlessly as Sramek began to shake until finally, wordlessly, otherworldly, he slipped through the President. It was only then Sramek regained control of himself and he spun on his heels to find that there was nothing behind him. WIthout another thought Sramek bolted down the street and to the nearest church. Later that day the street was crawling with priests and nuns."

bdeczeflavor.31.d:0 "Nestled within the quaint spa town of Jáchymov in Karlovy Vary lies the Jáchymov mines - a small deep-shaft mine dedicated to Saint Joachim that sits atop a rich silver vein and has been continuously mined since the 16th Century. Despite its mineral wealth, the mine and its surrounding town remained small over the years, and was long rumored to be cursed due to occasionally causing mysterious illnesses to long-term miners. However, thanks to the work of Marie Curie and J. Löwy throughout the last few decades, it was revealed that this ‘curse’ was merely the effect of acute radiation poisoning, for beneath the vein of silver we discovered a massive uranium deposit. \n\nSince its discovery, the uranium has been sourced in small amounts for testing and the land around it surveyed, with a few initial shafts already descending to reach the deposit’s outer reaches. However, no large scale uranium mining has occurred, or that is until now. Our current administration has felt it fitting to expand the mine in order to begin full-scale uranium extraction, primarily spurred on by recently published and internationally-presented research showing uranium’s possible applications in both domestic and military applications, but also fueled by rumors that the Internationale and German Empire both have their own secretive atomic research programs under wraps. \n\nSeeking to fully utilize this natural bounty we have been so lucky to have within our own borders, the entire mining operation has been nationalized, given a massive influx of new funding and staff, and fences have gone up around the mine’s exterior warding off potential on-lookers and wandering eyes as the national government takes over operations and the burden of the planned expansion. By our regime’s hand, Jáchymov will slowly be transformed into a bustling mining town, and from the earth beneath this quiet mountain town’s spas and rolling hills, we shall extract the fuel that will blast us into the Atomic Age."

Seemingly every facet of life has been thrown upside down, and the religious life of our nation is no exception to this, as today Gustav Adolf Procházka, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, along with a myriad of other priests, theologians and like minded individuals declared the birth of the Czechoslovak Church. Taking inspiration and claiming direct succession from the long dead Jan Hus, the so-called Czechoslovak Church has become the largest organized grouping of Hussites since the beginning of Hapsburg rule over former Bohemia. The Formation of this new Hussite Church is not something occurring out of thin air, as is the case with many schisms. Beginning simply as the Jednota, the group that would eventually become the CC was originally a group dedicated to promoting the heresy of Modernism within the Church, when Church authorities rejected these proposals, the group broke off.\n\nWhile the fact that these men broke off from the majority religion of our nation is causing much internal strife within the Catholic Church, many are actually lauding it. Those who laud the break off claim it is similar to a body purging itself of foreign bodies, and that in time, the Church will be all the stronger.

Violence which was once only a rare occasion during the previous rallies is now frequently being reported and further used as fuel in the social fire as crowds have been throwing rocks at police who have had to violently disperse the increasingly aggressive mobs.

Its firing rate has been lowered from the initial design, down to 500-600 RPM in order to stabilize recoil from firing. The regular submachine gun also sports a bipod, but in other models of the ZK-383 this bipod has been replaced with a resting bar and grip to stabilize the fire rate.\nIt fires 9x19mm Parabellum rounds, with the magazine supporting 30-round magazines attached to the side.

He was finishing his business, and all of a sudden, he remembers falling down. Obviously such an explanation was puzzling to all who heard it. To ease that tension, Masaryk told them he must've been targeted by vengeful Protestant ghosts.

This has posed some problems as Czech nationalists denounce Tiso as a traitor but all in all, as far as the government is concerned, that fat priest can rant all he wants to in Slovakia.

Instead they advocate for Slovak autonomy within the state rather than outright independence. This has served as an explanation for why the Party has begun giving speeches in favor of the Vlajka and the National Socialists. This seemingly schizophrenic support of two wildly different parties can be explained by the seeming fragmenting of the People's Party. Radicals within the Party, mostly former Vlajka members, have begun to make slow but steady headway in getting control of the Party. While still a minor faction, they have enough weight that they can meaningfully throw it around. Meanwhile more moderate factions have come out in support of the National Socialists.

Our success has inspired those oppressed around us, taking an increasingly large role in politics. The Bohemian Revolution, right at their doorstep, has painted a great fervor in their minds. They aspire to follow the great figures of the time, from Masaryk, to Beneš, to Stříbrný.\nOf course, only Poland could fit this nationalist description - a land constantly oppressed by its tyrannical neighbors; always imposing their will on the young Poland. One interesting consequence of the triumph of Czechoslovakia is its evolution and radicalization - a radical idea to include the Polish in our nation. While the first spokespeople, like Beneš, advocated this policy merely for a mutual defense, other figures have made more brazen attempts and gatherings. Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks alike have all heard the buzzing news from the offices of their politics - the idea of a Western Slavic Union. As the Czechs call it, Západoslovanská. A federalist union, much of its ideas hailing from the foundation of Czechoslovakia itself, mended and extended into the Polish. It would stretch from Prague, to Warsaw, to even Lemberg. Not only does this idea appeal to the staunch nationalists who wish to defend their interests together, it also heavily appeals to the Panslav Stříbrný, along with his entourage. While the idea of a West Slavic Union finds most of its support in the Czechs, the tense situation abroad has been pushing the realization of this federation forth.\nWhile the idea mostly centers around Czechoslovakia and Poland, there are yet those who desire greater. Some support the integration of the little Sorb population in Germany - along with the conquest of Silesia. Obviously, this has placed the idea of a Czechoslovak-Polish union on Germany's evil eye.\nPoland's participation in the Little Entente, too, has made the spreading of a full integration less obstructed.

The political machinations of these cliques slowly move in motion, as the death of Masaryk seems all but inevitable. Despite the changing tides in high society or perhaps in spite of them, Masaryk maintains appearances in public, smiling and waving as Czech citizens pass. For now, the people of Prague are oblivious to the ailments of our dear governor, yet as more and more official capacities are taken up by Beneš, those that are aware of the Governors condition prepare for the worst.

Jan Kefer, a man heavily ridiculed, humiliated and discredited, walked towards the center of the room, where he had gathered fellow occultists. Before the vlajka had taken over, they were forced to hide, and their belief system was suppressed by those who were too sheepish to be open-minded about the world around them. Now, these beliefs had become more accepted, and Kefer began to gain more credit as the trailblazer of Czech hermeticism. His disciples, those who believed in his vision while he was down on his luck, surrounded him in a circle. The Doctor nodded solemnly, acknowledging the presence of each apostle. \n\n Finally, after years, and the blessing of Jan Rys-Rozsévač, Kefer had all the resources he needed to undergo the most daring of rituals. The chanting began slowly and quietly. The dim lighting in the room wavered before being snuffed out entirely. As the chanting continues, the energy in the room is palpable. Filled with malicious intent, the aura is engulfed with the stench of death and rot. Sweat beads the face of the Doctor, as the voices of those reciting the chant begin to quiver and buckle. The target of such a ritual? The dog in Vienna, Karl von Habsburg. All of this energy will be directed towards the old jackal, and his death will be celebrated by all in Czechoslovakia! The Doctor nearly lets out a giddy laugh just by the thought of it. How much his fortune has changed! \n\nBut something is wrong.\n\nThe energy is strong. Too strong.\n\nThe negative energy of the room has devoured some of the participants in primal fear. It takes just one weak-willed person to flee and abandon the ritual. All too quickly, each man and woman in the circle breaks formation and flee. With nowhere else to go, the energy flutters around the room, a twisted amalgamation of suffering and torture. It lets out a final, agonizing scream. Then, it finds its new host."

bdeczeflavor.143.d:0 "A scientist, an astronomer, an Anarchist, a devoted husband, and father of the Czech Scouts, Jaroslav Štych is one of the most prominent figures in the nation - even more so now given his close relationship with President Luisa Landová-Štychová. Since the 1910s, these two have been joined at the hip and driven by love, espousing Anarcho-Syndicalist views and working together to create a true and Red Bohemia. Jaroslav himself is renowned for his astronomical work in the Česká Astronomická Společnost, but perhaps is more famously known now for his work with the Sdružení Socialistických Skautů a Skautek. Also known as the Sdružení Československých Skautů Socialistů - or simply just the Czechoslovak Scouts - the Scouts are a boys-and-girls scout group founded by Jaroslav Štychová himself in 1919 and based in Petrské nábřeží near Štefánik Bridge in Prague. As chief of the scouts, Jaroslav has guided Czechoslovak youth for decades, teaching them Syndicalist and Anarchist principles, outdoor survival training, basic education - especially in the field of science - and so much more. The Scouts themselves are divided into different categories based on age and gender, with Wolves being the main tier for ages 8 through 14, though others exist such as women-only groups, family-groups, and even groups separated by their favored activity such as cycling or hiking. To spread their message and show the nation their great deeds, they have also organized their own illustrated magazine and newsletter in 1921 - called Skaut Průkopník - of which Štych is the main editor still to this day, while also co-editing a joint magazine with the Spartacist Order called ‘Oheň’ - or Fire. \n\nDespite the uniform appearance, the Scouts are mildly divided internally, with half the group drawing more inspiration from E.T. Seton and the other from Robert Baden-Powell - each a foreign scout master of the highest order. This divide has led to differing practices among the camps, with the Baden-Powell group drawing influence from his Scout Movement, while the E.T. Seton group copied his love of Native American cultural practices through his homage-group the ‘Woodcraft Indians.’ Regardless, both groups only pay lip-service to these influences, and are still solidly Socialist, dedicated to lead the healing of young people, to bring them up to independence, to school them in nature, and to use the principles of the "modern school" of the Spanish anarchist and pedagogue Francesco Ferrero and other Anarcho-Syndicalist paragons. \n\nWorking with other prominent Anarcho-Syndicalists such as his now-wife Luisa, as well as the Kuklová family headed by Vlasta, and František Kadavý, the Socialist Scouts strive to educate and integrate our youth into the ideas of our new revolutionary state. Though he still dabbles with his astronomy work in the ČAS and plays second-fiddle to his far more influential wife, Jaroslav Štych is one of the most respected men in Bohemia, and one of the progenitors of our new Syndicalist nation."

The police quickly dispersed them but soon after 200 of them converged on another cinema shouting nationalist slogans like “Away with German movies!”, “Glory to the Slavic Prague!”, “Shame on Jews!” and “Long Live Stribrny!” and even sung “Hej, Slovane” for a while before they moved on.

The man, Adolf Mayer, was met with side-eyed glances as he declared his name. Mayer proceeded to slander our brave legionnaires as 'cowards' and 'traitors.' They left their country to die elsewhere. Before Mayer could continue his blasphemous ranting, the entire car was in an uproar, as a mob of Czechs began to bear down on the outnumbered Austrian clerk, restraining him. Mayer's face was heavily beaten and bruised and his torso sustained many blunt force wounds. The assault on the man lasted until car pulled to a halt in Jihlava, and he was thrown onto the tracks with little regard. Curses and slurs were spat at the broken Mayer before a contingent of officers arrived, resulting in Mayer's arrest. \nMayer's story skirts around the uniform descriptions eyewitnesses give; instead, silence is his motif.

However, unlike before when Hašek could usually straddle the line between good time and alcohol poisoning safely, it would seem that his liver and heart finally had enough, for following his multi-day binge, Hašek returned to the Golden Liter for a nightcap and suddenly collapsed at the bar. Suffering from rampant obesity, ravaged by diabetes, and with cirrhosis eating away at his liver, Jaroslav Hašek died on that barroom floor as his heart gave out while finishing off his third beer since arriving for his ‘nightcap’.

Along with that, protests against the bill itself are frequent as more and more picket lines form outside the legislative office, and the economy has seen a significant downturn as one of our largest industries goes dry. Most ministers and representatives  that initially supported the bill and who are outside the ČSL have already pulled their support, with many instead pushing vocally for its repeal in an attempt to save face. It would seem that despite our best efforts, our great nation will never be able to stay dry, and in an attempt to save face ourselves and to restore order and our mandate to rule, a motion to repeal the law has been called for.

As an opponent of the pro-Catholic Hapsburgs whose nominee for King, Ladislav was still a child, George seized Prague in 1448 and checked the Hapsburg faction. Ladislav’s guardian, future Emperor of the HRE Frederick III, named George as ruler of Bohemia in 1451 while the Bohemian Diet made him regent. When Ladislav came of age in 1453 George’s influence waned some, until Ladislav’s sudden death in 1457. Soon after George was formally elected King despite (probably false) rumors that he poisoned Ladislav. Under him Bohemia prospered and he even proposed a broad alliance between all European powers. He proposed this grand European alliance would solve all their problems peacefully and with a common Parliament; ostensibly to unite Europe against the Ottomans.. Then he refused Pope Pius II’s request to revoke the Compactata which legalized the Utraquists. While the Pope died before his planned Crusade against Bohemia could get going, the new pope instead supported a clique of anti-George nobles. In December of 1466 the Pope excommunicated George, declared him deposed and forbade any Roman Catholics from serving him. Both the Emperor of the HRE and the King of Hungary took this chance to invade Bohemia and while George would fight off the Hungarians he would eventually abdicate in favor of Vladislaus II.

The party has been on a decline ever since the Pardoners' Agreement, and the expulsion of the radical members has slashed the total number of ministers within the ČSDSD by over a third. Thus, to alleviate this strain and to unite against the Vlajka, Antonin Hampl has reached out to old members of our party, of whom many have joined in with the ČUSP, and has attempted to rekindle our old alliance. However, there was one caveat to being able to return to our social democratic party - each returning minister must agree to the rejection of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Despite Hampl’s best efforts, the response from these radicals was simple and concise: a laughable 'no'. Any more attempts have been met with similar laughable fates. It would seem that the Pardoners’ Agreement has done its damage, and the ČUSP and ČSDSD will never be whole again.

Entirely self-taught, he created his own style of drawing caricatures while working at once of Prague’s newspaper presses until he eventually grew as an artist. Aside from his cartoons and caricatures, Lada is also a brilliant landscape painter, as well as being skilled in costume and set design and even in fresco creation. To commemorate this great impact on our shared culture, a monument to his greatness has been erected outside the Stoletá Kavárna, - also known as the Centennial Cafe - a prominent coffee shop on the corner of Na Zderaze in Nové Mĕsto, Prague. The famed shop - a frequent watering hole for Lada, Hašek, and many other prominent members of the Moderate Progress movement - is famous for its dance hall with accompanying piano, its endless taps of various native ales, wines, spirits, and coffees, and its poker and game halls that frequently host Prague’s biggest gamblers - including the affluent plumber Vejvoda and the field chaplain Katz referenced in much of Hašek’s writings. \n\nDespite this illustrious history, the Stoletá Kavárna has fallen on tough times, but a resurgence of interest in literature due to our electoral victory has reignited interest in this hallowed old cafe. With a marble and brass bust of Josef Lada being built outside the establishment within its outside biergarten, the cafe itself has also been set to be completely renovated in a restoration project funded by the state.

bdeczeflavor.165.d:0 "Social Democrats have a long history of operation in both Austria and our Bohemia, once being the dominant party within the wider Empire. These days, our Český Sociálně Demokratická Stranu Dělnická is notably one of the few parties that truly still follows Vienna and the decrees of the Austrians without much deviation or pushback. However, the 1926 Pardoner’s Agreement shattered their once-dominant hegemony, putting the whole of the ČSDSD and its once-popular policies on rapid decline. Although the ČSDSD regained some relevance by the time of the 1936 election, all was not well for these pink democrats. \n\nThe first Pardoner’s Agreement introduced more radical elements into the party as our party forgave radical Socialists and extremists, allowing them to rejoin our ranks if they agreed to some token changes in political stance. With their numbers still greatly infecting the ČSDSD, these radicals must be cast out while we focus on the larger issue at hand - Black Monday - whose economic impact and the devastation it laid low has torn a hole within our nation. \n\nAustrian Social Democrat Karl Renner - one of our party’s main inspirational figures - has been eyed many times by political and economic philosophers close to our own cause lately, who after working with Renner have returned to advise our own party on possible routes of action to combat the economic crisis. As such, we shall try putting some of Renner’s ideas into practice ourselves here in Bohemia. On a similar note, like many Czech parties, Masaryk's revolutionary policy of autonomy shall be preserved so that stability and ethnic peace can continue within our varied lands. Centralism must be done right, as we must have control over this nation we have come to rule once more, but we must be cautious, for over centralizing brews as much unrest as too much de-centralization does. \n\nTo bolster our political power and to ensure that our policies pass however, we will need allies. Before the Pardoner's Agreement of 1926, the ČSDSD was in a noble democratic coalition with the remnants of the Agrarians, earning the title of the 'Red-Green Coalition'. This coalition combined the two least nationalist parties into a similar bloc, working on both workers and farmers. With the passing of the Pardoner’s Agreement, this coalition fractured, but now given the rising tides of chaos and suffering, perhaps it can be reaffirmed. Together with our Agrarian allies, we must help alleviate the farmers and the workers' plight for the good of the nation and all those who reside within. A new dawn is breaking for [tag.getname] - now it is only time for the ČSDSD to guide us there."

bdeczeflavor.166.d:0 "Originally one of the most vehemently progressive and anti-Austrian movements in Bohemia, the ‘Česká Strana Pokroková’ - or Realisté - has stood as a bastion of pro-Czech, anti-Austrian policy for ages. In the wake of the Pardoner's Agreement and after the recent slew of useless reforms from Kaiser Karel I, many worried Czech politicians have been soothed by the Viennese sirens, but these empty promises and token reforms have done little to assuage the Realisté. The underlying root cause for all this Austrophobia was largely caused by ineffectual reforms and failed initiatives pushed by Vienna that have never gone anywhere, leaving many Czechs to chafe under Habsburg rule despite our supposed autonomy - autonomy we are now finally granted though many still yearn for something greater. We desire true freedom, and the fools in Vienna refuse to give it; but now that they are finally granting some semblance of republican freedoms, our rabid Austrophobia has begun to slowly subside. This new dynamic, however, has not killed the seed of revolution or the fires of Czechoslovak nationalism. \n\nNow elected by our people through democratic mandate free from Vienna’s meddling, the Realists under former vice-governor Beneš are ready to lead the nation to greatness. No stranger to media manipulation, Beneš is certainly one for the newsreels, which was chiefly shown in this last election. Our victory was carried by the voices of our people, but we could not have done it alone. Through extensive television and radio advertisements, debates, and other forms of media manipulation, the Realists brought their cause far above all others, swaying the hearts and minds of the masses with the power of modern technology. The Realist media empire is extensive; and it shall be maintained so that our landslide victories may continue to roll in. In terms of our future goals, we plan to continue chipping away at Austrian Christian social structures, enacting harsher penalties for Syndicalists and extremists, and will attempt to give ourselves leeway in means of personal politics. To garner additional support and to aid all within our nation, we shall also push to enact larger welfare programs and to mobilize women in this dire time, in order to give the economy a needed boost going forward. Through reliable, transparent socially responsible and populist policies, anti-Austrian and anti-extremist stances, and with our media attack dogs at the ready, the Realists shall bring freedom and modernity to our [tag.getname]."

bdeczeflavor.167.d:0 "Being one of the few parties to have survived the exile of its main politicians, the bigwigs of the RSZML - or the Republikánská Strana Zemědělského a Malorolnického Lidu (The Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants) - fled to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in the United States, much like their fleeing contemporaries in the Realisté and ČND. This cohesive unit of predominantly-Czech immigrants and exiles was unofficially known as the ‘Bohemian Bloc’ - a silly pun on the block they lived on and the alliance that persisted long after their stay in America. Since their return following the passing of the Pardoner’s Agreement, the party has surged back to life, growing to now be the dominant party in our republic, similar to their main rivals the Realists. \n\nThe RSZML, like the Realists, were initially suspicious of the Pardoner’s Agreement, but with Karl promising reforms and a mission to march towards a final, stable, and equal federation saved Austria’s reputation with the RSZML, who view these token attempts at reform still to be far greater an effort than Franz Josef or Franz Ferdinand ever did - and with the core of their party returned from exile, they were in little position to disagree. With this past in mind, the RSZML sits behind the ČSDSD as the least nationalist parties in the nation. However, like all parties in Bohemia, it still retains heavy hints of nationalist sentiment - just less so in comparison to most of its peers. The RSZML in Bohemia is unique in that most of its policies operate well within Habsburg parameters, excluding the party’s uncharacteristically warm relationship with the Germans of German-Bohemia. \n\nRudolf Beran and Jan Malypetr have risen to lead the two main wings of the party, though ample influence is also exerted by famed Slovak agrarian Milan Hodža. The RSZML espouses agricultural unions and infrastructure expansion, while also putting forth one of the most broad and ambitious land reform plans of all of the five mainstream Bohemian parties. The RSZML espouses regional ethnic autonomy, planning to radicalize Masaryk's famous autonomism principle, piety, pro-peasantry and pro-farmer policies, and plans to strike a decisive deal with the German-Bohemians in order to keep the peace, lest the separatists Konrad Henlein and Ludwig Czech get their way. On top of this, the party plans to construct hundreds of kilometers of new railroads across the nation, and particularly through German-Bohemian towns, spreading our rail network and connecting rural Central Bohemia to direct routes to Berlin, Vienna, Krakow, and Pressburg - or as we wish to call it, Bratislava. Under these devoted agrarians, the peasants, farmers, and other agricultural workers of the nation shall finally be represented and rewards for their hard work as the nation marches to greater national unity and prosperity under God.l "

bdeczeflavor.168.d:0 "The ČSL, along with the CSDSD, is the other party to not have majorly resisted during the Weltkrieg, and thus entered a time of prosperity, as former Agrarians and Realists flocked to it. Now that these parties are back, in more or less their original state, the ČSL has had to keep up a tough battle concerning their electoral mandates. One reason for their struggling is that Masaryk despised them; they sometimes got along, but they also had to compete with the RSZML for votes. The ČSL is sometimes criticized as clericalist, Masaryk called them such, but as party leader Jan Sramek says, it is not - the ČSL values democracy just as much as any other. The ČSL, however, introduces Christian principles into their politics. As with withe RSZML the ČSL is also relatively popular with the Germans, especially the sister party. The ČSL seeks to protect Czech business, however, and has a record of not manipulating the trade market, unless it gives a sizeable boon in favor of Bohemia. The friendliness with Germans goes both ways; the ČSL seeks to integrate the German and Czech languages together, open places of worship along rural routes, and like all parties, continue the autonomy policy. Along with that, the ČSL espouses family ties, anti-smoking, anti-alcoholism,"

The CND puts Bohemia, or, the Czechs, before all else. To them, the problems at hand absolutely must be fixed, for the good of the nation. It uses a sense of shared identity and heritage to unite its people. One interesting tenet of the CND is the open animosity to the Germans and Jews, but Vienna has made punishing and actions against these peoples impossible. Instead, the CND has had to opt for compromises, of course in as much Czech favor as possible. The CND supports assisting the needy and poor that were outcasted by Black Monday, equalizing the classes to promote equal opportunities. The CND is also one for honesty, frequently getting in anti-corruption lawsuits against other politicians."

In Germany, Rozsévač built up the Vlajka so he could have the means to seize Prague Castle in an armed putsch, which he has finally done.\nThe Vlajka is vehemently anti-semitic, somewhat Panslavic, supports autarky and supremacy of Czechs and Slavs, and a bitter disdain for Masaryk and liberalism.

While Najman’s vision for the army minimizes expense and corruption, many are concerned about the efficacy of such a decentralized fighting force. After all, without central command, an army is a just bunch of men waving guns around. It is strategy employed that makes an army potent.

Domin, a proud nationalist and member of the Vlajka, had them moved so when a new rector was named the real insignia wouldn’t be used but copies would be. Domin knew the Germans wouldn’t voluntarily give up the insignia and he couldn’t just take them. Luckily for him the law was on his side. On November 20th the Ministry of Education agreed the Insignia should be moved when the rector wanted it to be. Two days later the moving day was set for the 26th. Problems arose when the Germans barricaded themselves inside the university to keep the insignia and were attacked by Czech students. The Czechs claimed that the Germans had attacked them by throwing things and pouring hot and dirty water on them. In any case the battle poured onto nearby streets where both groups of students were joined by bystanders. Czechs started attacking random Germans in the streets, breaking into German businesses and the headquarters of the Social Democrats and the Manes Association of Fine Arts which was guarded by a single policeman. Among the common anti-German slogans shouted by the crowd newer anti-Semetic ones soon were heard as well. Police underestimated the situation and responded...inadequately but eventually managed to calm the situation. Czech intellectuals denounced this barbarism and in the battle's aftermath Domin was replaced as rector. The new rector, Josef Drachovsky, was inaugurated with the real insignia. On the day of his inauguration former rector Domin made a speech over the boos of leftist students. These dissenters were beaten and tossed out by Domin’s supporters.

Due to the positive ratings by the public and a spark of interest within the Czech people, many within higher education are considering the expansion of an Egyptology department for their schools. Just today, Lexa has received offers for a position within numerous universities, including Charles University and Masaryk University. It seems that Novak has done his old professor justice."

bdeczeflavor.196.d:0 "The father of our King, Ferdinand Zdenek Lobkowicz passed away today in his bed. Born in 1858, Ferdinand served the Czech nation during its time under Austria, acting as a chamberlain. The nobleman was also a part of many notable societies, including the Imperial-Royal Secret Council.  He also was a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, which traces its origins to 500 years ago to the Duke of Burgundy. The dying man was surrounded by loved ones, including the King as he passed this morning. King [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared a week of mourning for his late father, and his funeral is slated to be in the upcoming weeks; he is to be buried in the Lobkowicz family tomb in the Church of St. Wenceslas.

bdeczeflavor.197.d:0 "Jaroslav Lobkowicz, a relative of Max, member of Knights Hospitaller, and Chamberlain of Pope, is a man of connections. Connections that could be useful in establishing the House of Lobkowicz on the world stage. Our kingdom has cemented power at home, but we need the recognition of the powerhouses in Europe if we are to stand a chance. One of the best ways for a Catholic kingdom to raise legitimacy is to turn its eyes to Rome. With his connections, Jaroslav could improve relations with the Vatican. Earlier today, Jaroslav took a phone call from the Pope, who engaged in a meaningful, yet lighthearted conversation with the most powerful man in the Catholic world. Jaroslav contends that the meeting went well and that he has opened the door for more cordial relations with the Vatican. With the politicians of democracy having eroded good Christian ties, we needed someone to mend the schism - and Jaroslav has done just that. May Catholic solidarity endure in these trying times."

bdeczeflavor.198.d:0 "Maximilian Lobkowicz, our King, has finally found a wife - a minor Bohemian noblewoman. While many were critical of a King without a Queen, the notable bachelor has put the uneasy heads to rest. News outlets and media centers have clamored to get any information on this marriage - the ceremony, the location, or even the name of the bride have been shrouded in mystery. The royal family has done well to prevent coverage of the marriage, as none figured out that the marriage took place in a very small proceeding within the Roudnice Castle. No more than 40 people showed up, and celebrations and carousing were put to a minimum. Many have begun to wonder the merit of such a marriage, as some guess that the King has done this to produce an heir and cement his power as the head of his House. Regardless of intentions, Maximilian is no longer a bachelor, and it is only a couple of days before the Queen-Consort is revealed for all of [CZE.GetName] to see."

bdeczeflavor.199.d:0 "Adolph von Schwarzenberg is known to be friends of the Vlajka, but not the modern Vlajka, the older one. The Old Vlajka is led by Jindřich Streibl, an electrician and politician who was one of the first members of the Vlajka. The Vjalka of old is considered much more moderate than the New Guard lead by Rys-Rozsévač, and many within the Old Order’s ranks feel a blatant disconnect between the two generations. Adolph Schwarzenberg was also an old member of the Vlajka, so upon his ascension, he decided to reach back out to his old friend Streibl, who still holds minor influence in politics. While this isn’t a grand overture that will result in massive political consequences, Schwarzenberg has a soft spot for his previous confidant, and bringing him to the fold will surely benefit either way. Whether or not the old friends can make amends, however, remains yet to be seen, as the New Vjalka’s paranoia reaches its culmination."

As planned, Streibl and Adolph met with rifles in the woods to hunt wild game and discuss the future of their political careers. During the hours away from the bustle of Prague, Streibl and Adolph tracked a deer and shot it, along with two rabbits. The kills were collected, skinned, and consumed later that day at a lodging in the forest by the King's associates, and the hunt was considered a success by all parties involved. However, the most important details of the hunt were the conversations held by the two hunters. Streibl has agreed with his old compatriot and has agreed to throw his hand for the King and the von Schwarzenberg House. While this is a minor victory, we will take all we can get, for one cannot have too many friends."

bdeczeflavor.201.d:0 "Vjalka did not always have the connotation it does now. The predecessor to the modern Vlajka, the Stará Vlajka, or Old Vlajka, was founded in 1928, two years after the Pardoners' Agreement. The Old Vlajka, compared to the New Vlajka, is not occult and less Christian in thought. When Rys-Rozsévač came along, there was a split in the group - some following Rozsévač's occultist thought, and others staying with Streibl, the new party head. With such a split, the New Vjalka was born. At first, the schism was amicable, but relations between New and Old deteriorated rapidly, with Rozsévač accusing Streibl of pandering to socialists, and Streibl decrying the blatant occultism of the New Vjalka. It is clear that there is animosity within the ranks of the Vjalka, and soon, both will be forced to confront each other, with only one depiction of Vjalka remaining in the end. The victor will be seen as the battle between Rozsévač and Streibl rages on for the soul of the Vjalka."

Today marks the beginning of the Riot of the Old Flag, where German-Bohemians have erupted into a protest against the Czech primacy preached by the Stará Vlajka. Areas surrounding the German border have descended into violence, railing against the Vjalka for ‘forgetting about proud Bohemians’. A march on Prague was hastily organized by the leaders of the protest before subsequently being put down by local police, and after such a failure combined with pressures from law enforcement, many of the protestors stood down after a long day of rallying and organizing to no avail. While this does not spell the end of dissent in German-Bohemia, it is a relief that they were not allowed to organize to the point of insurrection. We will have to watch agitators carefully and install more police presence throughout the region. We cannot let our nation fall."

He was born in Prague to Karl VI, Prince of Schwarzenberg and Princess Antonie Leontina of Fürstenberg, delivered safely, and has been brought back to his beginning life in Prague Castle. The Archbishop of Prague was notified as soon as possible and has already begun the preparations to baptize the baby boy. The charming baby has already caught the attention of news and media outlets, as a photo of the crying boy has found its way to the papers, captivating all who catch a glimpse of him. While he may be many years away from ruling, he has already captured the hearts of the Czech populace, who all view him as not only a future leader but as a child to raise collectively.

bdeczeflavor.204.d:0 "One of the best-preserved Gothic castles, Houska Castle has frequently been of occult interest. It is thought to cover one of the gateways to Hell, keeping demons trapped in the lower levels of the castle. The walls of the castle are face inwards, and many claim this is done to keep demons out. The New Vlajka has been known to make experiments involving the occult at Houska Castle to varying success; no doubt, if they were in charge, they would be conducting unending amounts of depraved experimentation and ritual in the castle. The castle itself is shrouded in legend and intrigue. It grows hard to separate history and myth. One story tells of, during its construction, prisoners were offered pardons if they would consent to being lowered into the hole. The first person, after a few seconds, began to scream, and when pulled back appeared aged and old. Whether or not the story rings true, mothers across Czechia tell this story to their young children to keep them in line. Otherwise, they might just take a trip to Houska Castle to see the insides."

For it is the 28th of September that commemorates St. Wenceslaus, duke of Bohemia and the patron saint of his beloved country. While the day is usually marked with the normal signs of celebration of an important feast day, closed shops and packed churches, this day however, is much more special then most, due to the visit of one man in particular. Karl von Habsburg-Lorraine, crowned King of Bohemia, is among the pilgrims in attendance at the St. Wenceslas Chapel in the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. While by no means an unplanned event, His Highness had long planned to return to Bohemia on pilgrimage since his coronation, the fact that he has so far been unmolested by any kind of protest is a small miracle in it of itself. Following the celebrations in Prague, the Emperor-King plans to continue his pilgrimage around the nation, visiting the various sites and shrines that Bohemia has to offer. The most important place the Kaiser will be visiting outside of Prague seems to be the Sedlec Ossuary. The Ossuary is a strange thing to the uninitiated. Made entirely out of human remains, the Ossuary is one of few chapels dedicated to Memento Mori, or Remember Death. The Chapel is a reminder that all men die, and are judged by their Creator at the moment of their death. Why the Kaiser has such an interest in this site in particular is anyone's guess. Regardless, the Kaiser is to stay only two weeks time in his favorite constituent of the Empire before his return to the Imperial City."

bdeczeflavor.206.d:0 "Long before the rise of Skoda or modern armored warfare, way back in the times of the great Jan Hus and his noble revolt, there existed a far older and Czech-borne terror of the battlefield. The mighty War Wagons of old were wooden carts sometimes adorned with simple armor plating pulled atop wagon wheels by a team of horses, and proved to be a terrifying sight on the battlefields of 15th Century Bohemia as they spewed forth blackpowder smoke and musket shots. Though their usage was not widespread and their actual military capability or effectiveness is not well understood, these mighty War Wagons were nonetheless a terrifying and awe-inspiring sight to behold for any simple soldier living in the 1400s. The wonder they felt must be akin to the wonder our men felt when the first Skoda tanks rolled off the linde, proving that armored warfare is as Czech as beer and Svíčková. We shall utilize the symbol of the War Wagon as a rallying symbol for our armed forces while building statues of these mighty war machines in military installations, bases, government centers, and academies across Czechia. Furthermore, specific funding will be given by the state to Skoda in order to keep this martial tradition alive."

By breaking into old caches, supply depots, museum collections, and more, we shall utilize these old historical pieces in defense of our homeland. Old cannon and rifles, ring-fire handguns like the Bittner Repeating Pistol, and even a few muzzle-loading rifles shall all be used to defend our Czechia at all costs.

The first way would be to temporarily confiscate as many traktops, motorized trucks, and other vehicles as we can from across the nation, taking all our people can spare while compensating them with various benefits and subsidies, granting us a quickly-assembled motorized base to further develop motorized and mechanized infantry tactics in the armed forces. However, this move would likely be unpopular with many farmers who need their spare vehicles to farm, and could harm our agricultural output. Instead, we could forgo any ambition of motorized tactics, and instead put our efforts into aiding our agricultural development further to increase our economic base and to grow a stronger and healthier population. Both would help the war effort in different ways, but we can only go ahead with one plan. What idea is best for the nation and the war effort?"

From Prague to Berlin, London to Oslo, Riga to Reykjavk, our gobleted banner flies high as the ideals and reformist attitudes of Jan Hus rise to dominance. Though it will take a great deal of time for our overstretched administration to consolidate this new, massive, pious realm, we are ready regardless to take on this herculean task, for this is the burden God has placed on us. We will not fail Him, and we will not fail the memory of Jan Hus."

POLITICS_T_G_MASARYK_DESC:0 "The first governor of Bohemia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, has proven to be one of the most popular and famous figures in Czech history.\nBorn in 1850, on the Morava river town of Hodonin, the Grand Old Man of Europe was raised by Catholic parents, later becoming part of the Reformed Church. In 1900, Masaryk founded the Czech People's Progressive Party, later christened the Realisté. By 1907 the new politician was elected to the Imperial Council of Vienna, and yet again in 1911.\nUpon the declaration of war which dragged Austria-Hungary into the Weltkrieg, Masaryk supported the transformation of Austria-Hungary into a federation, before moving into opposition of the monarchy. By now he was a wanted man in Austria-Hungary, and retreated to Paris.\nAs the tide turned decisively and the Germans neared Paris, Masaryk fled yet again, this time to New York. Here he denounced the coronation of Kaiser Karl as King of Bohemia in late 1924. Two years later, Masaryk would return to Bohemia - not as a revolutionary, but as part of an agreement between wanted Czechs and the monarchy. Kaiser Karl promised federative reforms in Bohemia and pardons for Masaryk and many other colleagues of his, on the condition that they would quell the rising tension in Bohemia and save it from needless destruction. In the first Bohemian elections, Masaryk and Beneš were elected in a near landslide, becoming the first governors of a reformed Bohemia. Now, in 1936, Masaryk stands at a frighteningly old age, viewed by many to pass away very soon, as a national hero of the Czech people."

POLITICS_RUDOLF_BERAN_DESC:0 "One of the few men who never fled the grounds of Bohemia, Rudolf Beran was naturally gifted with speaking skills. Born in Southern Bohemia in 1887, Beran indulged in agrarian movements from his youth before officially joining the RSZML. While Beran looked up to Agrarian chairman Antonín Švehla, a centerpiece of the Czech domestic resistance, Beran never became wanted by the K.u.K. authorities. His career as it is today began shortly after the end of the Weltkrieg, atop accusations of anti-semitism, a distaste for democarcy, and a love of censorship. Owing to his speaking skills and humble background, Beran forged a name for himself and rose throughout the ranks of the Agrarian Party, becoming general secretary before finally heading the party himself. Beran secretly envisions Czech independence, although has never really avowed it, but is nonetheless expected to guide the RSZML and the wider nation into a prosperous future for all peasants in our Bohemia."

POLITICS_JAN_MALYPETR_DESC:0 "Jan Malypetr has long been a fixture within the RSZML. Born in 1873 into an upstanding, rich family of landowners from Central Bohemia, Malypetry was born with the silver spoon but traded it in for plowshares and manure the first chance he could. Raised and educated in high society, Malypetr proved his sense of leadership and economics early during his time running his father’s sugar refinery and one of his family’s many farms before entering politics, where he would carry on his love for the farm life and respect for the work our farmers do to sustain the nation. Entering the National Assembly as a relative unknown, Malypetr was determined to make a name for himself through cooperation and sound legislation. Right out of the gate, despite his upper-class upbringing, Malypetr became a champion for the peasantry, defending his democratic mandate each term without issue due to his calculated method of being a minister. Finally rising to lead the very party that got him his start, Malypetr now stands as the conservative yet caring mouthpiece of Bohemia’s peasants and farmers. Though secretly a proponent of Czechoslovak independence, Jan Malypetr has not let this dream and his distaste for Vienna cloud his judgement nor take precedence over his primary priority - caring for and elevating the downtrodden masses of our downtrodden nation - the masses who feed our very people and serve as the most basal foundation of our society."

POLITICS_ZAPOTOCKY_DESC:0 "Antonín Zápotocký now leads the nation as Chairman of the RSNS and father of our new Syndicalist republic. Born in 1884 as the son of one of the ČSDSD’s chief founders, Socialism and Syndicalism have been great influences to  Zápotocký since childhood. Though seemingly more radical and authoritarian than his contemporaries in Landová-Štychová’s clique, Zápotocký is far from the Totalist dictators and despots of the wider Internationale. He stands as a champion of ethnic autonomy, equality, and economic development for all. Under his watch, our state shall become a crimson beacon of anti-authoritarian thought and true Syndicalist equality for all the world to bear witness to."

POLITICS_LANDOVA_STYCHOVA_DESC:0 "Noted Anarcho-Syndicalist and Feminist, Luisa Landová-Štychová now stands as the matriarch of our new Syndicalist society. Born in 1885, Landová-Štychová attended monastic schooling as a youth before becoming educated in business. Refusing to take over her father’s business and influenced by her young-love and eventual husband Jaroslav Štych - another noted Anarchist and astronomer - the young Luisa joined the fledgling worker’s movement in the early 1900s. From there, she created numerous Socialist agencies such as the Union of Socialist Monists and the Socialist Scouts before the horrors of the Weltkrieg forced all things to come to a halt as the thunderous cannons and howling guns screamed for years. Following the war, she was one of the first women to be elected to the Chamber of Deputies given her widespread influence and reputation as a sound, rational leader of the worker’s movement. From this lofty position, she continued to exercise her influence and further radicalize into the champion of Anarcho-Syndicalism, Feminism, and revolutionary action that she is today. Seizing on the chaos surrounding Zápotocký’s coup attempt, Luisa Landová-Štychová and her moderate allies routed both Totalists, Republicans, and Authoritarians in order to seize the reins of power for herself. Now standing as the leader of the nation and herald of our new revolutionary state, Luisa Landová-Štychová shall guide our people into their new and equal destiny."


POLITICS_JIRI_STRIBRNY_DESC:0 "Born in the town of Rokycany from the Pilsen region, Jiří Stříbrný was involved in politics from a young age. He was a participant in the founding of the National Socialist party. He was elected to the Imperial Council in 1911. A vehement anti-Austrian, Stříbrný was nevertheless drafted in 1914 and reserved in 1917. The first thing he did upon his release was to join the Mafia, the domestic Czech resistance. He also ousted pro-Austrians from the National Social party. Shortly before the end of the Weltkrieg, the Mafia was clamped down on, Stříbrný included. He fled the country, returning at the agreement of the Kaiser and Masaryk - the Pardoner's Agreement. Instead of rejoining the National Socialists, now the Realist Party, Stříbrný opted to join the National-Democratic party, slightly radicalized and influenced by Romanian legionnairism. After the passing of Dr. Karel Kramář, Stříbrný assumed party head. His party represents a more radical approach in Bohemia, and Stříbrný is carefully watched by Vienna, lest he act up."

POLITICS_RYS_ROSZEVAC_DESC:0 "Jan Rys-Rozsévač stands as one of the most controversial Czech politicians of his time - neither loved, nor hated, rather merely overlooked. Rys-Rozsévač and the Vlajka movement rose to prominence in Bohemia after Radola Gajda and many of his legionnaires found themselves marooned in Transamur. While Gajda was known to have far-right tendencies, Rys-Rozsévač's Vlajka movement quietly usurped Gajda's Legionnairist Community, over time siphoning its membership, for without a leader the party was but a husk. Rys-Rozsévač worked in Germany, on the border of Bohemia. Until now, he has been publishing his works there and keeping close tabs on the politics of Bohemia, besides managing the Vlajka party. He was pardoned upon Bohemian independence, returning and resuming the mantle of the Vlajka chairman. Even as a free Czech again, Rys-Rozsévač was carefully monitored; although soon, it would be all for naught: Rys-Rozsévač has seated himself upon the throne of the independent Czech people."

POLITICS_EDVARD_BENES_DESC:0 "Edvard Beneš, famous second-in-command to T.G. Masaryk, was born Eduard in the small town of Kožlany as the 10th child of his family. He studied political science, and found himself increasingly indoctrinated into nationalist circles. He graduated law school in Dijon.\nBeneš, before meeting his close friend T.G. Masaryk, was atheistic and nearly a Marxist, ditching these views for a much more pragmatic and "realist" stance. However, Masaryk's guiding led Beneš to the forefront of Bohemian politics. He identified with the domestic resistance in the Weltkrieg, the Maffie, meeting with Masaryk and Milan Štefánik. Abroad, in France and Britain, he campaigned for Czechoslovak statehood, building a tight case for such an action.\nOnce it became evident that the Entente was going to be on the losing side of the war, Beneš and much of the Maffie went inactive or exile. He fled with Masaryk to New York City, settling in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Here many exiled Czechs and Slovaks laid in exile; denouncing the coronation of Kaiser Karl I as King of Bohemia. The response at home, in Bohemia, was closely monitored by the Czechoslovak émigrés, coalescing in the 1926 Pardoners' Agreement. Here the National Council, Benes and Masaryk included, returned to Bohemia to save their people; along with one large ulterior motive.\nNow, the former Council is essentially disbanded, in part to Kaiser Karl's promising federative reforms.\nMasaryk's death has put him as the main head of the reformed Bohemian nation, and the future of Czechoslovakism and a free Bohemia as a whole."

POLITICS_VOJTA_BENES_DESC:0 "A brother finally released from his sibling's shadow, Vojta Beneš was six years older than Edvard, born in the very same Kožlany. Like Edvard, originally Eduard, Vojta was originally Vojtěch Beneš. Originally entering a career as a teacher, Beneš moved to the United States to work in expatriate schools, returning to Bohemia in 1915 to begin campaigning for Czechoslovak independence. He was one of the primary architects of the Bohemian neighborhood in Upper Manhattan, joining the resistance as a supporter of foreign exile. He returned to Bohemia in 1926, following the Pardoners' Agreement, acutely eyeing the political situation and Karl's policies to switch his view.\nBeneš began obtaining official posts in youth groups and teachers' organizations, rising the ranks of education institutions in Bohemia and Austria. Beneš' work was primarily as an educator still, but as time bore on he began to invest more into politics, much like his brother Edvard. Beneš stands as one of the more nationalist sides of the CSDSD, sometimes getting the prying gazes of Austrian intelligence.\nWith Beneš at the wheel of [CZE.GetName], Beneš' life in his brother Edvard's shadow has finally ended."

POLITICS_ANTONIN_HAMPL_DESC:0 "One of the very few influential Czechs to not deal with the Maffie, Antonín Hampl and the Social Democrats have found themselves at a disadvantage in the reformed Bohemia. Born April 12, 1874, in the little Eastern town of Jaroměř, Hampl attended the State Industrial School in Prague. He had ties to the Social Democratic trade unions, quickly rising to high positions in the Metalworkers' Union.\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, much of the high leadership of the Social Democrats refused to cooperate with the Maffie, earning them special rights in the eyes of Vienna. When the Germans broke through in France and captured Paris, much of the internal strife in Bohemia disappeared as the Maffie realized they were fighting a losing conflict. When the K.u.K. troops arrived home, they quickly reigned in any stubborn resistance members, most notably not members of the Social Democrats.\nBefore the Pardoners' Agreement, the Social Democrats held a near monopoly on Bohemian politics, riding high off the victory of the war being due to the great workers in the Bohemian industrial zones. Hampl, upon hearing of the coronation of Kaiser Karl I of Bohemia, decided to stick by the monarchy, but that could not be said for many of the other politicians, who felt betrayed by Vienna's actions. Thus, the ČSDSD split, a more nationalist bloc and a loyalist bloc. Hampl was in the middle of it all, finally turning over to the nationalists upon hearing of the Pardoners' Agreement. His close associate František Soukup welcomed him with open arms to the new ČSDSD, bringing him to a high position due to his previous experiences in politics. This relationship only bolstered his nationalist leaning.\nHampl and Soukup are fighting a tough battle against old political adversaries, finding themselves campaigning frequently against the famously loud and public T.G. Masaryk and Edvard Beneš. In the first elections of 1926, Hampl and other ČSDSD members were successful in reaffirming the Red-Green Coalition, yet still lost.\nHampl's political maneuvering in the election has made being able to assume party leadership over the aging Soukup a thought for the inevitable election resulting after Masaryk's death."

POLITICS_JAN_MASARYK_DESC:0 "Jan Garrigue Masaryk is both our newest president, and the son of T.G. Masaryk - our national father and most beloved leader who tragically passed away in 1936. However, this legacy is far from all Jan is good for. Born in 1886 to his famous father, the young Jan struggled throughout school and left to travel the United States at his earliest possibility. In America, he lived in trashy apartments and worked odd-jobs in New York and New Jersey, where he would eventually be diagnosed with a mild form of schizophrenia. Shortly before the outbreak of the Weltkreig, he moved back to Bohemia - just in time for the outbreak of war where he would enlist as a cavalryman, serving in Galicia, Hungary, and Italy as disciplined soldier with a knack for horse-care despite allegedly never firing a shot. One the war had ended, he worked closely with his father in government as his aide and mediator, bouncing around official positions and as an ambassador until his father’s death. Since the death of T.G. Masaryk, Jan has floated within the National Socialists party as a living embodiment of his father’s vision - utilized both for his cunning and political acumen as well as a symbol of his father’s legacy. However, through democratic mandate, he has now been granted the chance to distance himself from his father as his own man and leader, while of course still following T.G. Masaryk’s ingenious vision for our future, and now ‘Honza’ - as his father called him - will guide both the National Socialists and the nation into our rightful future."

POLITICS_JAN_SRAMEK_DESC:0 "A Catholic in a country famous for anti-Catholicism, Jan Šrámek has done what many thought was impossible - won the 1936 Elections. Born August 11, 1870 in the village Grygov, Šrámek was influenced and converted to Roman Catholicism in his early life. He graduated from Palacký University in Olomouc with a degree in theology, earning priestly positions and continuing to study social issues. He eventually began participating in politics in and around Nový Jičín, founding Catholic workers' unions and associations. He was elected to the Imperial Council in 1907 and sat in the Moravian assembly.\nUpon the beginning of the Weltkrieg and rise of the Maffie, Šrámek refused to participate in the resistance and continued priestly work and politics at home, thus sparing him from the vigorous investigations after the fall of Russia and breakthrough in France.\nIn 1924, shortly before the coronation of Kaiser Karl I, Šrámek founded the ČSL, amassing a small sum of seats in the next legislative election. He was infamously against the Pardoners' Agreement, fearing destabilization and violence to erupt more in Bohemia. While that never happened, Šrámek and the returned Masaryk frequently debated and disputed in the Bohemian Landtag. Masaryk and Beneš despised Šrámek as clericalists, but in the end, Šrámek was able to gain his cooperation in governance."

POLITICS_FRANTISEK_SOUKUP_DESC:0 "František Soukup has risen to lead both the Social Democratic Workers Party and the nation as its newest governor. Born in 1871, Soukup was born into a family of innkeepers. Leaving these humble beginnings, he moved to Prague to study law, but was quickly expelled due to his public expressions and activities while a member of a progressive student movement. In response, he instead went to Graz to finish his studies, only finally returning to Prague to graduate nine years after beginning his schooling. From graduation, he dived into politics, dabbling in the Young Bohemian Party before joining the Social Democrats in 1896. Becoming their paper’s editor, Soukup worked as a progressive firebrand, and was involved in the Second International, founded the Worker’s Academy, and became involved in the autonomist and atheist movements despite his Catholic upbringing. Rising through the ranks, he became one of the leading figures of domestic resistance within the ČSDSD during the Weltkrieg, and one of the most vocal anti-Austrian voices in the predominantly pro-Austrian party. Since his rise, Soukup has proven himself to be one of the nation’s most devoted public servants, truly wanting the best for all corners of our society. A true Czechoslovakist, a moderate Socialist, and an avowed democrat, governor František Soukup shall guide both the party and the nation into new, progressive heights like never seen before in our oft-oppressed land."

POLITICS_RUDOLF_MLCOCH_DESC:0 "Rudolf Mlčoch, founder and leader of the Czechoslovak Traders’ Party, has risen to become the President of our independent republic. Born in 1880, Mlčoch was educated at a young age, but quickly tired of his studies and left school to follow in his father’s footsteps as a basket maker. While working under his father, he attended basketry school in Mělník, and upon graduation, he traveled to Prague and Vienna to pick up more business expertise. After returning back to his hometown of Prostejov, he founded his own factory, which caused him to begin building relationships with various trade corporations around the nation. This would cause him to eventually find contacts in and move operations to Moravia, where he would build his own small business empire and found the Traders’ Party. Throughout the years, he would continue to build his business while representing the party in government until our independence, where he would begin advertising his party on a national level. Since our freedom was won, Mlčoch has endured, spreading his party's message of free trade, industrialization, pro-small business practices, and enshrined civil liberties. With the Purple Legion by his side and with the financiers of the nation behind him, there is nothing President Mlčoch cannot achieve!"

POLITICS_FRANTISEK_MARES_DESC:0 "Serving as our new president and the face of the National Democrats, František Mareš is ready to lead the nation into prosperity. Born in 1857, Mareš is one of the oldest and most constant faces in the Czech political scene. Studying in medicine and psychology at a young age, Mareš would work as a professor and chairman of Psychology at Charles University long before joining the political scene. However, his fanatic patriotism and sympathies with the Czech nationalist movement drew him into politics and the National Democrats, where he would climb the party ranks as a ravenous party loyalist and sharp-witted leader. With loose ties to the Vlajka and a devout Czechoslovakist, Mareš has friends across the Right spectrum of Czechoslovak politics. As President, he is expected to guide the nation towards a conservative, nationalist, and stalwart future free from foreign influence."

POLITICS_MILAN_HODZA_DESC:0 "The first Slovak president in our nation’s history and a devoted leader within the RSZML, Milan Hodža is now prepared to guide the nation into its Green destiny. Born in 1878 in what was at the time Hungarian land, Hodža studied in Hungary and Romania to become a journalist. Upon graduation, he moved to Vienna to work in the Austrian press office until he moved back to Slovak lands within Hungary to enter politics within Hungary’s only Slovak party - the Slovak National Party - in 1905. It was here that Hodža would adopt his stern Agrarian stance - something that would win him no allies within the SNS, causing him to desire to branch off and create his own agrarian party. However, his plans were cut short with the advent of the Weltkrieg. Moving back to Vienna with the outbreak of the war, Hodža returned to work for Archduke Franz Ferdinand as a personal aide - an illustrious career allowed by their established friendship that blossomed during Hodža’s previous work in Vienna. As an aide to the Archduke, Hodža presented him with his federalization plans, including drafts for an independent Slovak state. However, the course of the war and shift in policy following the victory of the Central Powers threw these proposals out the window, and Hodža instead travelled to Bohemia in hopes of cultivating a new Slovak agrarian party utilizing the sizeable Slovak minority within the nation in proportion to the Czech population. Instead, Hodža found friends and allies within the RSZML and joined its ranks. Since then, he has risen to the top of the national ladder and the party hierarchy to be both party leader and President of our republic. A devoted agrarian, Czechoslovakist, and internationalist, President Milan Hodža seeks to bring about international cooperation between Agrarian groups, a wider implementation of the cooperative vision, and truly cohesive union between Czechs and Slovaks. Whether he can do so however, is another matter entirely."

POLITICS_BARTOS_DESC:0 "A self-described ‘Medievalist,’ František Michálek Bartoš is one of the most respected historians in the nation. A devout follower of the teachings of Jan Hus and perhaps the most famous authority on Hussite history, Bartoš may as well be Jan Hus reborn. Born in 1889, Bartoš led a standard childhood before going for schooling and higher education in an attempt to learn more about our glorious nation’s glorious past. In his studies, he became enamored by the writings and history of Jan Hus, devoting his life in Hus’ image. Working as a theologian, educator, archivist, and author at the illustrious Charles University, he bumped elbows and became friends with many other Hussite figures, such as Gustav Adolf Procházka, Karel Farský, and František Kovář, who together would go on to form the foundations of our modern Hussite Revolution. Now, as leader of our newly rebirthed nation, Bartoš  seeks to apply the teachings of Hus to a republican form of government in an attempt to fuse Hussite piety and reforms with republican ideals. Whether this fusion shall pay dividends however, remains to be seen, but the nation rallies behind their new pious father regardless."

POLITICS_PROZCHAZKA_DESC:0 "Second Patriarch of our noble Hussite Church and the father of our new Hussitic monarchy, Patriarch Gustav Adolf Procházka stands among the most pious and devout men in the nation. Born in 1872, Procházka studied to become a Doctor of Theology at the University Academy of Sciences before becoming a priest in the Roman Catholic Church dedicated to reform. However, after a career of disgust over the Catholic Church’s decadence and corruption, Procházka - along with other notable clerics such as Karel Farský and František Kovář - broke off to form their own, independent Hussite Church in 1920. After the passing of Farský in 1927, Procházka rose to be the Church’s second Patriarch, and using his influence and standing, Procházka utilized this position to finesse the rise of the new Hussite government with his ally František Michálek Bartoš. With the nation now under his noble watch, Patriarch Gustav Adolf Procházka is set to reform our union into a true, new Eden on Earth - one supported by its people and wrapped in the thought of the late, great Jan Hus."

POLITICS_KOVAR_DESC:0 "Third Patriarch of our beloved Hussite Church, František Kovář has risen to take the place of Patriarch Gustav Adolf Procházka following his tragic passing. Born in 1888 and educated as a theologian like his predecessor, Kovář is also notable for being Dean of Charles University’s theology department and for being a respected and published journalist and author of theological texts. A fellow co-founder of our independent Hussite Church and a devout man of the cloth, Patriarch Kovář is expected to follow in Gustav Adolf Procházka’s footsteps in reforming and purifying our once-corrupt state.

These dominoes have fallen not just because of nationalism, rather in tandem with their supposed overlords.\nMany pardoned soldiers and politicians who came back to Bohemia have renounced allegiance to the Kaiser, and declared a new, independent [CZE.GetName], one which they dreamed of decades before.

Other sources on regional newspapers tell of the 'Manifest der Deutsch-Böhmen,' a document previously authored during the Bohemian Revolution, has come back into the limelight as it is presented to international governments, particularly Austria and Germany.\nThe document's signatories include the leaders of the Deutsch-Böhmische Heimatfront, or DbHF, and the Deutsche sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei, or DSAP. Both of these parties lie on opposite sides of the political spectrum, yet their hatred of Prague's oppression unites them.

[CZE.GetName] has annexed any of the land it occupied in the war; under threats of future destruction. The claims go to Hungarian Slovakia, all the way to Ungvar in the Carpathian Mountains, etched off of the claims of the Czechoslovaks during the Weltkrieg.\nWhen Austria recognized the new Bohemia as a sovereign state, the rest of the world followed."

Masaryk had been in declining health for months, however famously always there for his people. Edvard Beneš, the new interim Governor, has mostly been running the Kingdom in Masaryk's stead. Throughout Bohemia, Slovakia, and down to Illyria, where Masaryk campaigned for the Illyrian state, funeral bells toll. To show their support and mourning, men and women alike have donned red articles of clothing, and pinned red roses - Bohemia's famous flower. In Austria, a period of mourning was declared and Kaiser Karl's condolences were delivered via radio.\nThe new Governor of Bohemia is slated to be elected in about a month's time - and the stakes are large; to carry on Masaryk's legacy."

Cementing a victory absolutely nobody doubts, Beneš vows to continue the great Masaryk's legacy, his hand in the Pardoners' Agreement, and a vow to save Bohemia from the careening effects of Black Monday.\nHis cabinet is much the same as it was under Masaryk; only that Masaryk's son is the new second-in-command.\nBeneš delivered his victory speech to a crowd of onlookers in the historic Wenceslas Square, in the very same location where Masaryk triumphantly returned to Bohemia, with an entourage; publicizing the Pardoners' Agreement at last."

BOHALT_small_business_support_desc:0 "Corporations like Škoda have their merits, but the primary unit of business should be the small owners' shops. Small business and local entrepreneurialism is key to building not only our economy up, but also to creating a true middle class while also uplifting the peasantry. Our corporations shall still be allowed to operate and still be allowed to serve as the foundation of our economic system, but they shall be kept in check so that the true nucleus of the economy - our small businesses - is allowed to flourish."
BOHALT_insurance_program:0 "A Peasant's Insurance"
BOHALT_insurance_program_desc:0 "A poor harvest is not always the farmers' fault, and in that event, plus many more always possible and ever-looming scenarios, people need to be able to continue their way of life. We shall not punish our farmers for the bad hands nature or God deals to them, and so a fund shall be established, pulled from taxes and various fees the farmers already pay, so that our farmers - the pride of the nation - have a safetynet to fall upon in hard times. We will always be there to help pick them off their feet."
BOHALT_popular_bohemia:0 "The Popular Bohemia"
BOHALT_popular_bohemia_desc:0 "The recent elections have come and passed, and our mandate to rule has steadfastly endured. Our majority in the government has prevailed, and many more, both citizens and ministers, support the RSZML. Now, it is time to look into the future!"


BOHALT_realist_victory:0 "Victory of the Realisté"
BOHALT_realist_victory_desc:0 "The expected winners of the election, the Česká strana pokroková - or Czech Progressive Party and more commonly called the Realists - under Benes, have taken the mantle of power. Benes already basically ran the nation as Masaryk was too ill to carry out the functions of state, but now he rules in name as well as in function. With the heirs of Masaryk at the helm, that status quo is expected to be continued as the final wishes of our national father are carried out."
BOHALT_mandate_of_democracy:0 "Mandate of Democracy"
BOHALT_mandate_of_democracy_desc:0 "Until 1926 the Kaiser scorned Bohemian democracy and only accepted it when he was forced to. Given the chance he would undermine it without another thought. We must uphold Bohemian democracy not only as an example to ourselves, but as an example to the world."
BOHALT_the_great_compromiser:0 "The Great Compromiser"
BOHALT_the_great_compromiser_desc:0 "Benes is a man of words, great words, the best words in fact. While he ran the state in Masaryk's stead he became known as the Great Compromiser for his magnificent efforts in diplomacy, able to find middle ground where many assumed none existed. These talents will be mighty valuable to him and his administration."
BOHALT_against_the_reds:0 "Resist the Radical Reds"
BOHALT_against_the_reds_desc:0 "Despite his great reputation for diplomacy there is one group that Benes will not abide by, Syndicalists. If you give them a meter they will take a kilometer. To save Bohemian democracy from revolutionary Syndicalism the Red Cancer will have to be cut out."
BOHALT_secure_diet_support:0 "Monopoly over the Diet"
BOHALT_secure_diet_support_desc:0 "While the Realists have a significant media presence there are worryingly few who agree with us completely in the Diet. If we are to save Bohemia we must bring the Diet under control through savvy deals and realistic compromise."
BOHALT_meet_with_german_representatives:0 "Meet with German Representatives"
BOHALT_meet_with_german_representatives_desc:0 "To the German-Bohemians the election of Benes was the continuation of a system they already hated. However, while the population might reject us, the politicians are always easier to influence. If we reach an agreement with these politicians then maybe they can snuff out the fires at home."
BOHALT_expand_castle_influence:0 "Expand the Castle's Influence"
BOHALT_expand_castle_influence_desc:0 "The Castle, the name for our propaganda arm operating out of Prague Castle, has a wide reaching influence on Czech media. However many new innovations like radio and movies remain outside our view. If we are to effectively manage our image then we must expand our reach."
BOHALT_export_industry:0 "Market the Modřany Sugar Factory"
BOHALT_export_industry_desc:0 "Bohemia is the home of European sugar production and has been for centuries. As a staple of much of Europe’s tables, if we were to open a new and expansive sugar factory, say in the Prague suburb of Modrany, then we can exploit Europe’s sweet tooth for our own profit."
BOHALT_independent_economy:0 "Melt the Economic Chains"
BOHALT_independent_economy_desc:0 "At the moment Bohemia’s economy is built on a foundation laid by Vienna. Any move for freedom could be countered by the Kaiser pulling the rug out from under us economically. We must reach out to Berlin and even Warsaw and build new economic ties not bound by the fickle whims of a far off monarch."
BOHALT_rights_of_women:0 "Women's Franchise"
BOHALT_rights_of_women_desc:0 "Masaryk was famously a defendant in the Hilsner trial, and in turn a vocal and active proponent for women's rights. We must further his cause to its rightful conclusion and give women the vote they so deserve. The fact that it would secure for us a large voting bloc for the foreseeable future is just icing on the cake."
BOHALT_facts_dont_care:0 "Facts Don't Care About your Feelings"
BOHALT_facts_dont_care_desc:0 "Some call us cold, others call us ruthless and still others call us uncaring. We call ourselves realists. We don't need their praise when we have the results to vindicate us. We are not cold and uncaring monsters. We are Realists and we are just what Bohemia needs."
BOHALT_nationalistic_rhetoric:0 "Nationalistic Rhetoric"
BOHALT_nationalistic_rhetoric_desc:0 "There are still those within Bohemia that hold out hope that the Kaiser will save us from our woes. We must prove them wrong. With the facts behind us even the most stubborn and committed monarchist couldn't help but begin to doubt and Benes can make even a hairline fracture of doubt into a canyon."
BOHALT_anti_clericalism:0 "Fight Clericalist Elements"
BOHALT_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "Bohemia is a religious nation, or was at the very least, and as such there are quite a few men of god within the Diet who all clamor for the return of God to our national politic. This is quite frankly moronic and Benes will let everybody know why."
BOHALT_worker_welfare:0 "Workers' Welfare"
BOHALT_worker_welfare_desc:0 "Benes cares for all Bohemians and it pains him that so many have been forced onto the streets by Black Monday. The Bohemian common man must be saved lest his desperation turn him to radicalism and plunge us into anarchy."

BOHALT_our_interests_first_desc:0 "As far as Kaiser Karel is concerned all the constituent kingdoms of the Empire must work for the betterment of Austria so that their work may be rewarded...in time.

BOHALT_democratization_procedures:0 "Process of Democratization"
BOHALT_democratization_procedures_desc:0 "Our government, while a democracy, is still heavily caged by the Austrians. However the Kaiser and us agree for once that it can't last like this if the Kaiser’s grand vision of a ‘Danubian Federation’ is to succeed. We will work with him to further his vision of the Federation, if only to loosen the vice grip on ourselves."
BOHALT_defense_of_rights:0 "Defense of Freedom"
BOHALT_defense_of_rights_desc:0 "The Americans were right when they said that all men were guaranteed the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Unlike the Americans, we here in Bohemia will realize that right for all our citizens and defend that right as we would any other."

BOHALT_summit_with_agrarians_desc:0 "Word has reached Benes that the Agrarians and the Social Democrats are in talks for a coalition.

BOHALT_christian_social_victory_desc:0 "In a victory few expected, the Christian Socialists of the ČsSL - or Českoslovanská strana lidová - have managed to eke out a victory. However, these conservatives of the ‘People's Party’ are assailed on all sides by forces outside their control. They must act quickly if they are to lead Czechoslovakia to greatness."
BOHALT_industrial_engineering:0 "Škoda Works Engineers"
BOHALT_industrial_engineering_desc:0 "The Skoda Works is the largest single employer in the nation. If we are to reach prosperity its vital that the government reaches an agreement with them that is admirable to both parties."
BOHALT_vanguard_of_conservatism:0 "Vanguard of Bohemian Conservatism"
BOHALT_vanguard_of_conservatism_desc:0 "Bohemia has seen a surge of liberalism lately and a turn away from God and Conservatism. This must be reversed if the nation is to avoid anarchy and degeneracy."
BOHALT_assistance_from_austria:0 "Aid from Vienna"
BOHALT_assistance_from_austria_desc:0 "In Vienna sits mountains of resources that the Austrians do nothing with. So, they sit there and rot rather than be put to good use. We must reach out to the Kaiser and acquire as much of this excess as possible."
BOHALT_german_situation:0 "The German Situation"
BOHALT_german_situation_desc:0 "Since 1926 the German-Bohemians have been nothing but trouble. If Bohemia is to have peace then they must be tamed...now."
BOHALT_classist_system:0 "Classist Systematics"
BOHALT_classist_system_desc:0 "Many leftists disavow class as a reason for oppression and wish to break them down. This is the wrong view. The capitalist made his money through hard work, grit and determination mopping floors and taking several jobs as a young man. Now in his old age his hard work is being rewarded. To encourage the lazy youths to work as hard as their forefathers we shall further reward them."
BOHALT_preserve_the_church:0 "Reaffirm Papal Relations"
BOHALT_preserve_the_church_desc:0 "Many other parties have at best been neutral on the status of the church or, in the case of the liberals and Syndicalists, have sought to distance our nation from God's representative on Earth. We must rectify this and draw Bohemia closer to the Church if we are to reap the rewards of God's blessings."
BOHALT_business_nonintervention:0 "Business Non-Intervention"
BOHALT_business_nonintervention_desc:0 "The free market determines who survives. If we prop up failing businesses now then they will just fail again later. Supporting a failing business model is a losing proposition. To create a stronger economy we must use some logic and let the weak die so the strong can thrive."
BOHALT_welfarism:0 "Implement Bohemian Welfarism"
BOHALT_welfarism_desc:0 "The people cry out for help and God demands charity from his subjects. In the name of Christian charity we will give the poor and unemployed insurance to keep them off the streets. Not enough that they will feel tempted to live on it indefinitely mind you, but enough to keep them from starving."
BOHALT_only_when_in_czech_interest:0 "...Except in Czech Interests"
BOHALT_only_when_in_czech_interest_desc:0 "While we do believe in the free market, leaving it totally hands off could only lead to trouble in the long run. If the long term viability of the nation demands it, government action of any kind is justified. So, as even the largest pillars of our economy begin to lean we shall begin to prop them up."
BOHALT_mutual_discrimination_prevention_agreement:0 "Discrimination Prevention Agreement"
BOHALT_mutual_discrimination_prevention_agreement_desc:0 "Many Bohemians are wary of the German-Bohemians.

BOHALT_export_steel_desc:0 "The Trinecke Iron and Steel works is the most important steel works in the country. Its bosses assure us that with just a small loan they could greatly expand operations and become a major employer. There is little reason to decline their offer."
BOHALT_protectionism:0 "Protectionist Policies"
BOHALT_protectionism_desc:0 "Czech industry is mighty yet still vulnerable. Major multinational companies could easily undercut it and take over our economy in price wars local companies couldn’t possibly win. To stop this threat we will institute strict tariffs to protect our industry and nurture it until it can stand on its own. Some say this will only hurt us in the long run, we cannot wait to see them proven wrong."
BOHALT_language_integrations:0 "Linguistic Integrations"
BOHALT_language_integrations_desc:0 "Bohemia is a land of many languages with the main ones being Czech and German. In German dominated areas like the Sudetenland many road signs and books are written exclusively in German, while in the rest of Bohemia the same holds for Czech. To help the two communities intermingle more we shall mandate the use of Czech and German both across the nation on all official buildings, documents and signs."
BOHALT_territorial_assembly:0 "Importance of the Assembly"
BOHALT_territorial_assembly_desc:0 "Who knows how to run things like a person who lives there? We will begin the formation of local assemblies to run the day to day of the various regions of the country. This will both take an administrative load off our overworked bureaucratic middlemen while also raising civil pride amongst the populace."
BOHALT_increase_coal_outputs:0 "Lignite from the Northwest Basin"
BOHALT_increase_coal_outputs_desc:0 "We have been tapping the lignite veins of north west Bohemia for centuries by now. However recent explorations have uncovered still more untapped reserves. We must begin exploitation of these new mines at once!"

BOHALT_strictly_bohemian_weapons_desc:0 "The native Czech arms industry is miniscule and dominated by foreign companies. To remedy this we began construction of a large arms factory in Moravia but construction stalled during the Weltkrieg. With the War long over, tensions in Europe rising and money flowing into our coffers now is the time to finish the complex and kickstart a revival of Bohemian firearm production.."
BOHALT_tax_income:0 "Income via Taxes"
BOHALT_tax_income_desc:0 "Our predecessors kept taxes low to please the populace while neglecting the fact a lot of state income should come from taxes. We shall raise the taxes on most things by a slight amount, about 1% or so, which should bring in a new influx of cash to our treasury. The people will complain but with our new economic prosperity they will have all the money they could ever want."
BOHALT_stable_bohemia:0 "Zůstaneme Věrní" #We Will Stay Faithful
BOHALT_stable_bohemia_desc:0 "We have achieved the impossible by not only winning the election but by totally reforming society to better fit the modern world. However there is still much to be done! For God and Country we march forward into our new age!"

BOHALT_national_democratic_elected_desc:0 "The National Democrats of the ČsND - or Českoslovanská národní demokracie, were once the dark horse’s in the election since falling from their peak some years ago. Despite this past slipup, they have managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. As Vienna watches on nervously we must get to work, for the betterment of the Czechoslovak state."
BOHALT_stave_off_reds:0 "Stave Off Radical Reds"
BOHALT_stave_off_reds_desc:0 "The Syndicalist anarchist revolutionaries and their lackeys in the CSDSD are a threat to the nation.

Syndicalist newspapers shall be shut down and meetings of known Syndicalists shall be observed."
BOHALT_nation_comes_first:0 "The Nation Comes First"
BOHALT_nation_comes_first_desc:0 "Traditionally all the constituent nations of the Empire work towards the betterment of Austria with the understanding that that would lead to the improvement of us all. This has been proven to be patently false. We shall work within the guardrails Vienna constricts us with, but we shall work for our own happiness first."
BOHALT_steel_works:0 "Construct the Kuncice Steel Refinery"
BOHALT_steel_works_desc:0 "Kuncice is mainly an agricultural town now but an increasing number of people are working in newly picked coal and iron mines dotting the landscape. This suggests a lucrative opportunity to build a new, grand steel refinery in the city. Only through modern industry can Czechia truly prosper and Kuncice is the first step on that road."
BOHALT_suppress_pangermanism:0 "Suppress Pangermanist Antics"
BOHALT_suppress_pangermanism_desc:0 "A rot infests Bohemia worse than the dirty Syndicalists, Pan-Germanists. They see Bohemia and its people as Germans who should unify with Vienna more directly or, as the more vile of their creed claim, Berlin. This cannot stand. The Czech people have a proud history distinct from that of Germany and Austria. We must catapult it to the forefront and destroy this fifth column."

BOHALT_assist_the_needy_desc:0 "Black Monday has left many destitute and without food leading to mass hunger. While many paint us as cruel and unforgiving that can’t be further from the truth.

BOHALT_alleviate_the_crisis_desc:0 "We are faced with many crises all hitting us at once. The Austrians hate us, our economy is in tatters and the German-Bohemians continue to ask for more that we are reluctant to give. If we are to make it through this we must act now and act decisively."
BOHALT_allnational_coalition:0 "The All-National Coalition"
BOHALT_allnational_coalition_desc:0 "Partisan bickering will get us nowhere. In the name of peace we must form a grand All National Coalition of all the major parties. With everybody having a say in how things are done then the innate instability that comes with democracy can be negated somewhat."
BOHALT_diplomatic_approach:0 "The Diplomatic Approach"
BOHALT_diplomatic_approach_desc:0 "When the Bohemians and Pan-Germanists bicker and fight, only Vienna profits. Together however we can achieve much. WIth their more radical members marginalized we should reach out a hand and unite with our wayward kin and bring them into our new nation."
BOHALT_social_problems_national:0 "Social Problems are National Problems"

BOHALT_nationalize_public_institutions:0 "Nationalize Public Institutions"
BOHALT_nationalize_public_institutions_desc:0 "Much of the Czech economy was privatized in the years before Black Monday, now we know how backwards a policy like that is. While mass nationalization is syndicalism, important industries like power, water and some vital industrial areas shall be nationalized so future economic downturns don't push us into a spiral we can't recover from."

BOHALT_another_weltkrieg_desc:0 "To the West the vengeful Syndicalists sharpen their bayonets on the other side of the Ludendorff Line, to the East the revanchist Russian Bear has awoken from her long hibernation and prepares to return her cubs to her control and in the middle of them lay the victorious and resplendent Kaiserreich nervously watching them both and waiting for the inevitable strike. If Bohemia is to emerge from the inevitable Second Weltkrieg intact we must start preparing for it."
BOHALT_autonomism:0 "Autonomist Principles"
BOHALT_autonomism_desc:0 "Centralism has its upsides, but its downsides far outweigh them. We must grant those below us more autonomy to do what they feel is best. The bureaucrat in Prague can’t know what's best for the worker in Olomouc."

BOHALT_physics_of_nationalism_desc:0 "The great Frantisek Mares has proven that a love of your country improves not only your country, but yourself.

BOHALT_czech_governing:0 "Czech-Dominated Governments"
BOHALT_czech_governing_desc:0 "The majority should be ruled by their own.

BOHALT_oppose_hungary:0 "Oppose the Plotting Magyars"
BOHALT_oppose_hungary_desc:0 "Hungary, the dominating second half of the Empire, has exerted much influence over our minorities to undermine us. We should start a public outreach program to these disaffected minorities to counter the perfidious Magyars and achieve true social harmony."

BOHALT_drift_from_austria_desc:0 "The Kaiser, while detached from daily life in Bohemia, is well aware of our nationalist aims. While publicly speaking for Czech independence would only lead us to devastation, we must let Vienna know privately that the Czechs are no longer their pawns."
BOHALT_corrupt_destruction:0 "Prevent Future Corruption"
BOHALT_corrupt_destruction_desc:0 "Corruption kills Empires, imagine what it would do to a state such as ours. While our nation is not corrupt, corruption can spring up at any moment.

BOHALT_socialist_success_desc:0 "The elections are over and the votes are counted. To nobody’s surprise the Českoslovanská sociálně demokratická stranu dělnická, or the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Worker’s Party, has won. With the ČsSDSD’s collaboration with the Empire and their moderation in the wake of the Western Revolutions well known, they have been branded as a safe alternative to any other parties. Now in control of the government, it remains to be seen just what this ‘safe alternative’ will do."

BOHALT_worker_defense:0 "Judiciary for the Worker"
BOHALT_worker_defense_desc:0 "Oft times it seems the entire system is stacked against the Worker. One of the biggest columns to this system of oppression is the legal system which has routinely sided with big business against the interest of the common man.

BOHALT_educational_opportunities:0 "Rural Education Fund"
BOHALT_educational_opportunities_desc:0 "Outside of industrial centers like Prague and Brno much of Bohemia remains rural and uneducated, seemingly neglected by time itself.

BOHALT_the_worker:0 "The Industrial Toiler"
BOHALT_the_worker_desc:0 "Our nation runs on manpower. The many thousands of anonymous workers in the factories, railroads, shops and mines.

BOHALT_the_farmer:0 "The Fields' Harvester"
BOHALT_the_farmer_desc:0 "Just as the factory man is vital for our economic prosperity, the farmers are vital for our social prosperity.

BOHALT_trade_union_opportunities:0 "Opportunities for Unions"
BOHALT_trade_union_opportunities_desc:0 "For much of Bohemia’s recent history, and especially since the Western Revolutions, trade unions have been under strict government watch for revolutionary Syndicalist taint.

BOHALT_german_natural_resources_desc:0 "Since 1890 the Pilsen-Skoda arms factory has been a major economic engine for the city and the nation as a whole.

BOHALT_work_with_agrarians:0 "Cooperate with the Agrarians"
BOHALT_work_with_agrarians_desc:0 "We have long had much in common with the Agrarians and in fact have cooperated with them for much of our history. The splintering of the worlds, and Bohemia's, political scene has hit both of our parties hard. To cement our mandate we should join hand in hand with our Green brothers once more and revive the Red Green Coalition."
BOHALT_smart_centralism:0 "Smart Centralism"
BOHALT_smart_centralism_desc:0 "Centralism is a double edged sword.

BOHALT_prevent_nationalist_scuffles_desc:0 "Despite our progress anti-Syndicalist elements within the nation do not trust us. They denounce us as traitors to the Crown, traitors to the Czech race or traitors to God. While our more radical elements urge us to meet force with force, we will show them we are better than that.

BOHALT_just_bohemia_desc:0 "We have saved Bohemia. When we first were given the reins of power the people toiled in factories for slave wages as others got rich. Many thousands wallowed in poverty as a few hundred feasted. Now however we have done the seemingly impossible. We have instituted Socialism in Bohemia while not falling to radical anarchy or Austrian ire. Instead, if anything, the Austrians favor us more! We stand on the edge of greatness. Now all we must do is reach out and take it!"

How could they truly be representatives if they do not champion the will of their constituents? The will of the people has been revealed, and they put stock in us, for they have shown as much through their power of the vote.

While the intention to build a better future is admirable, we cannot subject ourselves to Obscurantism and censorship, no matter the circumstances.

Calling themselves the new Hussites, these reformers deny the destiny of having the teachings of Jan Hus remain relegated to the pages of history and are championing true reform under the Wenzelkrone. The tyranny of the old King Wenceslaus IV is long over, but it lived on under Austrian tyranny and through republican corruption.

### Focuses ###

SCT_free_caledonia:0 "A Free Caledonia!"
SCT_free_caledonia_desc:0 "The tyranny of Maximism has been cast aside. For the first time in two centuries, Scotland is a nation again! Hail Caledonia!"
SCT_german_watch:0 "Under German Watch"
SCT_german_watch_desc:0 "Our gallant ally in Europe was essential in establishing the new Scotland. We would be well placed to show our gratitude by cementing an alliance with Germany via putting the Jacobite claimant, Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, upon the throne of Scots."
SCT_rightful_king:0 "Under The Rightful King"
SCT_rightful_king_desc:0 "Canadian assistance helped bolster the faltering Scottish Nationalist movement. The Provisional Government has deemed it wise to begin the process of reintegrating Scotland into the Entente fold."
SCT_union_of_crowns:0 "The Union of Crowns"
SCT_union_of_crowns_desc:0 "The rebellion against the Union of Britain has sparked something in the Scottish people. No longer satisfied with being a mere constituent member of the United Kingdom, the Provisional Government has opted to seek a middle path between Nationalists and Unionists and renew the Union of Crowns. The title ‘King of Scots’ will be used for the first time in two centuries!"
SCT_united_kingdom: "The Union of Parliaments"
SCT_united_kingdom_desc:0 "Disloyalty to our oppressed brethren in the rest of the British Isles is not something that radical Unionist voices in the Provisional Assembly wish to tolerate. The 1707 Union of Parliaments must be restored, as must the pride in being both Scottish and British. God save King [CAN.GetLeader]; God bless our precious Union!"
SCT_democracy:0 "For The People, By The People"
SCT_democracy_desc:0 "Moderate heads seem to have prevailed. The Scotland of the future will be one guided by Liberal and Democratic principles. Not by radicalism, and not by the terrorism or chauvinism or either Nationalist, Unionist, Covenanter, or Syndicalist. Ours shall be a shining beacon in the North Atlantic, with liberty and justice for all Scots men and women."
SCT_dictatorship:0 "For All True Scotsman"
SCT_dictatorship_desc:0 "It seems the Homeland Watch coup has proven successful. We cannot tolerate Unionist dissent, nor the treachery of Syndicalism. It is the solemn duty of John MacCormick and the Homeland watch to launch a truly transformational programme in Scotland. A Scottish National Renaissance is at hand! Scotland can only be a true democracy when the pride of a people is restored, and the auld Scots identity rebuilt."
SCT_christian_nutters:0 "In His Service"
SCT_christian_nutters_desc:0 "Perhaps the most effective fighting forces in the rising were the Covenanter brigades. Hard line Scots Presbyterians lead by the charismatic Minister Reverend Dr. John White, they have managed to absorb a great deal of Unionist support with their heavily Anti-Catholic rhetoric. Following the march on Parliament Hall and the displacement of the provisional government, it seems this almost mystical movement may very well attain its goals; the renewed Covenant with God, and the stamping out of Popery."
SCT_macleans_dream:0 "For The Workers"
SCT_macleans_dream_desc:0 "John MacLean was a National hero in Scotland. Oswald Mosley has bastardised his dream beyond belief. The First President of the Union of Britain would be shocked and appalled at how his countrymen were treated, but that does not mean that the Syndicalism project was a failure. By playing host to a Syndicalist economy on a smaller scale than that of the Union of Britain, we can bring about true equality to our divided land!"

SCT_first_elections:0 "The First Elections"
SCT_first_elections_desc:0 "With the successful transition of the caretaker Provisional Government into a constitutional democracy, vigorous campaigning has been underway by each of Scotland’s democratic political parties. May the best candidate win!"
SCT_press_freedom:0 "Guarantee Press Freedom"
SCT_press_freedom_desc:0 "The cornerstone of a Liberal Democracy is a free press and the freedom to express one’s self. The new Scotland will hold these values at its heart, with truth and justice for all."
SCT_peace_with_socialists:0 "Deal With The Socialists"
SCT_peace_with_socialists_desc:0 "The socialists of Scotland are not entirely content with our rule. Many took up arms against us and will gladly do so again. It is time to decide what to do with these violent groups, either casting them out entirely or attempting to make peace with them."
SCT_political_pluralism:0 "Promote Political Pluralism"
SCT_political_pluralism_desc:0 "The Maximists tried to destroy the very notion of opposition and it was in this fury that Scotland was galvanized. We will not make the same mistakes and instead promote moderate political discouse and greater pluralism."
SCT_local_democracy:0 "Local Democracy"
SCT_local_democracy_desc:0 "Scotland’s system of parishes and cities comes from a vastly outdated and unionist view of the country. We shall instead replace this parish system with a 3-tier system of county councils, burghs, and regions. In doing so we will usher in a more accountable local democratic system for all Scottish people." 
SCT_homeland_watch:0 "Deal With The Watch"
SCT_homeland_watch_desc:0 "The Homeland Watch is a nationalist paramilitary group that fought during the initial rising and prevented more radical elements from usurping our power during the elections. A major question still lingers: what is to be done with the group?"
SCT_entrenched_liberty:0 "Entrenched Liberty"
SCT_entrenched_liberty_desc:0 "Our goal to make Scotland a shining example of democracy the world over nears fruition. The Scots have always been a freedom loving people, now we have the state to prove it."
SCT_religious_issues:0 "The Sectarian Divide"
SCT_religious_issues_desc:0 "One of the few issues that the mainstream democratic political parties have agreed on is that the curse of sectarianism must be either contained, or alternative arrangements found. Either way, all are in agreement that such divides only make Scotland weaker."
SCT_negotiate:0 "Unionist Negotiations"
SCT_negotiate_desc:0 "It has been decided the best way to deal with Scotland’s sectarian issues is to simply negotiate with the Unionists. To make them feel truly included in Scotland’s own democracy, a democracy that takes inspiration from the mother of all parliaments that they previously paid homage to."
SCT_union_autonomy:0 "Autonomy For Unionists"
SCT_union_autonomy_desc:0 "It has been decided that Unionists may never truly embrace the new Scotland, which is perfectly and is their right as citizens in the North Atlantic’s finest democracy, however we cannot have them causing trouble for their own political ends. A system of autonomous council areas within Glasgow and the West of Scotland has been advocated as a solution for this problem."
SCT_free_thought:0 "Promote Free Thought"
SCT_free_thought_desc:0 "The suppression of thought was key to Maximist rule. In our new Scotland we will instead promote the opposite and provide a safe haven to scientists and political dissenters as well as liberating our own people."
SCT_liberalize:0 "Liberalise the economy"
SCT_liberalize_desc:0 "The Scotland of tomorrow will be one that embraces the ideas of our own national son, Adam Smith. With the election of the fiscal right, the Scottish people have signalled a desire to end the Syndicalist rhetoric of the past, and usher in an economy of free market prosperity!"
SCT_austerity:0 "Implement Austerity"
SCT_austerity_desc:0 "Paying for the mechanisms of the new Scottish State has proven costly, and as a result, there is simply not enough money to continue much of the Provisional Government’s wartime welfare programmes. The market shall provide, not the government."
SCT_balance_books:0 "Balance The Books"
SCT_balance_books_desc:0 "Austerity seems to be paying off. Our international debt is being slashed, and the populace are growing less and less dependent on state aid. Our centres of international finance flourish!"
SCT_privatisation:0 "Privatize The Oil Fields"
SCT_privatisation_desc:0 "The best way for us to capitalise on Scotland’s oil fields is to leave it in the hands of private business. The market best allocates resources, and our burgeoning oil industry will bear fruit for years to come!"
SCT_socialism:0 "For the common man"
SCT_socialism_desc:0 "The common weal has prevailed. The notion that all people are entitled to shelter, food, and healthcare as a fundamental human right. Scotland has always had an inclination towards humanitarianism and Social Democracy, let us show the world what a truly transformative Social Democratic state can accomplish!"
SCT_welfare:0 "Implement Welfare Measures"
SCT_welfare_desc:0 "Ours will not be a government motivated merely by material gain, nor will we allow ourselves to grow complacent as Scotland begins to find its feet. All of Scotland’s people must be cared for from cradle to grave. The limited welfare of the Provisional Government will be expanded on."
SCT_new_economics:0 "Schachtian Economics"
SCT_new_economics_desc:0 "The same slow and steady economic model implemented by the German Empire has much to teach us. Schactian economics is pulling Germany out of an economic mire, it can do the same for us!"
SCT_democratic_oil:0 "North Sea Oil"
SCT_democratic_oil_desc:0 "Large deposits of Oil and Gas have been found off of the coast of Scotland. Exploiting these newfound natural resources will benefit us greatly"
SCT_new_constitution:0 "The New Constitution"
SCT_new_constitution_desc:0 "When the Christian Salvesen maritime company made the discovery of the North Sea shelf in Scotland’s maritime jurisdiction, nobody could figure out exactly how to capitalise on this new resource. Our government is set to nationalise Christian Salvesen, and all the richest of the North Sea."

SCT_benevolent_dictatorship: "A Father To The Nation"
SCT_benevolent_dictatorship_desc:0 "John MacCormick has used his influence in both the Homeland Watch, and their leading role in the Provisional Government to seize the apparatus of power in an almost silent coup. Dissenting publications and community groups have found their offices and meeting halls vandalised by unidentified thugs. It seems the quest for a Scottish National Renaissance will be successful at any cost."
SCT_defang_parliament:0 "Defang Parliament"
SCT_defang_parliament_desc:0 "Many voices in the initial days of the Rising called for a Constitutional Democratic Scotland. While this is, of course, ultimately in our own interests, Scotland in its current state simply cannot be trusted to tread this path. Parliament must be brought to heel by the Homeland Watch if we are to continue to steer the ship with clear conscience."
SCT_control_opposition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
SCT_control_opposition_desc:0 "With Parliament sufficiently neutered it no longer serves much of a credible threat. Despite this many of the democratic parties within parliament continue to rally against us. These elements must be brought into the fold until it is time to remove the leash."
SCT_scots_education:0 "A Scots' Education"
SCT_scots_education_desc:0 "Ireland has seen limited success in attempting to reintroduce their traditional language. We believe that we can do better. Radical plans are being drawn up at each of Scotland’s old universities for a new curriculum that will teach Scotland’s children the correct way to act and speak. Scottish English must be stamped out, and the Auld Scots tongue restored. The future of our country depends on it. "
SCT_empower_watch:0 "Empower The Watch"
SCT_empower_watch_desc:0 "It would be naïve to think that the Homeland Watch would simply go away with the Provisional Government. John MacCormick understands this, and he also understands that these are men passionate about the future of their country and cultural kin. Local authorities must be administered by the Homeland Watch and their force of arms, not by untrustworthy agents of Unionism, Popery, Religious extremism or Syndicalism."
SCT_ban_covenanters:0 "Reign In The Covenanters"
SCT_ban_covenanters_desc:0 "The Covenanters are a strange group. While we see eye to eye on some issues there more...extreme views are proving a hindrance. Backed by fanatical warriors and a charismatic leader, it is time to eliminate them before they can become a sufficient threat."
SCT_venerate_our_heroes:0 "Venerate Our Heroes"
SCT_venerate_our_heroes_desc:0 "How far we have come. Bruce and Wallace would be proud. In an age of industry and machine gun, we have triumphed over England yet again in the pursuit of a Nation of our own. We must ensure that every Scottish child grows up knowing the stories of Bannockburn and Stirling Bridge. "
SCT_martial_law:0 "Establish Martial Law"
SCT_martial_law_desc:0 "Sectarian issues; left over arms caches, Maximist resistance. All of these problems continue to plague blessed Caledonia at a time where we need unity more than anything else. The recently reconstituted Scottish National State Land Army along with our own Homeland Watch operatives should be able to keep the issue contained, and the people submissive until our goals can be achieved. "
SCT_destroy_traitors:0 "Arrest The Unionist Traitors"
SCT_destroy_traitors_desc:0 "The same roar goes out all over Glasgow and the Southwest of Scotland; ‘Round the bastards up!’ It seems that the Homeland Watch has come up with an innovative solution to the sectarian grievances in our country, rounding up the most radical of unionist and loyalist extremists, and putting them into special Watch administered prisons far out of Scotland’s major population centres."
SCT_red_scare:0 "Destroy The Red Clydeside Menace"
SCT_red_scare_desc:0 "John MacLean is a problematic figure. While he and his brand of Syndicalism are beloved by our people, we cannot allow their naivety to undermine our plans for National Renaissance. We must seek to undermine his legacy at every turn and expose the crimes committed by the Maximists against our people. Only then will the red menace never return to our shores. "
SCT_faith_unity:0 "Unity Through Faith"
SCT_faith_unity_desc:0 "While we are not a particularly sectarian movement, we accept that our own homegrown religion of Presbyterianism under Kirk should be one of the unifying factors of our country. Not only will this help placate the distrustful Unionist community, but it will also remind those Catholics who most supported Syndicalism who this country belongs to."
SCT_military_buildup:0 "Military Buildup"
SCT_military_buildup_desc:0 "How can we hope to preserve our newly found Independence and sense of purpose without the arms to defend it? The foremost focus of the National State government will be to repurpose old Union workshops for the benefit of Scottish arms manufacturing."
SCT_defence_contracts:0 "Defence Contracts"
SCT_defence_contracts_desc:0 "Sensing a void in the market, many international and some domestic companies have come flocking to our government with their wares. It seems we have no shortage of innovative enterprises from which to draw our national defence from."
SCT_build_forts:0 "A New Hadrian's Wall"
SCT_build_forts_desc:0 "If history has shown us anything, it’s that our wretched neighbours to the south will never leave us alone. Scotland will be defended until the bitter end, with watchtower, landmine, and bayonet. They will never again cross the tweed with impunity."
SCT_exploit_north_sea:0 "Exploit The North Sea"
SCT_exploit_north_sea_desc:0 "The rigs roar! For millennia, Scotland has been sitting on riches it could not yet previously fathom. The discovery of oil off the coast of Orkney, Shetland, and Aberdeenshire can be all things to all men. Let us export this resource as needed and build the mightiest military that our borders have ever seen."
SCT_promote_business:0 "Promote Scottish Business"
SCT_promote_business_desc:0 "As necessary as the National Rising was, it has utterly drained the Scottish economy. We cannot in good conscience prioritise arms funding at this moment in time. Scotland’s industry must be given time to heal, recover, develop, and grow before any such notions can be tabled."
SCT_scottish_houses:0 "Highland Town Initiative"
SCT_scottish_houses_desc:0 "The poverty inflicted upon us as part of the British Empire has been nothing short of staggering. Children in ragged clothes wander the tenement blocks of Govan and the Gorbals. While the Union of Britain launched social housing schemes, these were mostly focused around the cities. We will begin constructing new towns in the undeveloped countryside to bring prosperity to the people."
SCT_support_farmers:0 "The Crofter Question"
SCT_support_farmers_desc:0 "Scotland’s traditional crofters have always had a rotten deal. The clearances, the land war following the first Weltkreig. As we seek to rebuild Scotland, we must also rebuild Scotland’s lost Highland communities. We will ensure that the Lairds never return to the northern uplands, and that those who work the land, own the land."
SCT_mineral_mining:0 "Exploit Highland Minerals"
SCT_mineral_mining_desc:0 "Scotland had long been the powerhouse behind the British Empire, and the Union of Britain after. It is time that the natural resources of Scotland were turned over to benefit the Scottish people. It is our aim to open one new mine per month. Scotland will be reinvigorated by our natural bounty of coal and iron!"
SCT_permanent_stability:0 "Permanent Stability"
SCT_permanent_stability_desc:0 "While our reforms have proven immensely satisfactory, John MacCormick has decided that a few more decades of direct rule from the Homeland Watch is necessary to keep Scotland on the right path. As a result, we will transform the apparatus of the old Provisional Government into something far more permanent, for all true Scotsmen."
SCT_restore_democracy:0 "Restore Democracy"
SCT_restore_democracy_desc:0 "The Homeland Watch coup could never last forever, nor did we wish it to. Scotland is now enjoying the fruits of it’s Cultural Renaissance. New generations of our young now speak in the auld tongue, and the Scottish identity is now all but rebuilt. Let us turn Scotland back to the people, now that they can be trusted to safeguard our homeland."

SCT_gods_country:0 "One Union Under God"
SCT_gods_country_desc:0 "With the storming of Parliament Hall by our battle-hardened forces, we have shown the Scottish people that God’s firm hand is not to be trifled with. The decedent ideas of modernity shall be cast aside, we must usher in a new Covenant with God, as our forefathers did many centuries ago."
SCT_sword:0 "The Sword"
SCT_sword_desc:0 "What is Scotland without loyal Christian legions? A weak, powerless and defenceless cub.  No more the lamb of God, we shall become his lion, and Scotland’s legions will shake the earth on which they walk. They walk God's country and put our enemies to the holy sword."
SCT_religious_police:0 "Investigate The Papal Conspiracy"
SCT_religious_police_desc:0 "The agents of Rome continue to conspire against us. Everywhere a true blue blooded Scotsman turns, a Jesuit may be listening to his every word. We must root this out. Our sources tell us that the Papacy and the forces of the Internationale may very well be collaborating with Catholic Syndicalists to overthrow our regime. We shall toss their priests in prison and make them talk!"
SCT_crush_monarchists:0 "End The Unionist Menace"
SCT_crush_monarchists_desc:0 "The Unionists have proved useful for a time. Predominantly protestant, some have even supported our regime, hoping that we may at some point seek to reestablish the union. It is time to shatter their pathetic dreams."
SCT_shield:0 "The Shield"
SCT_shield_desc:0 "We are at the heart of a global revolution. Not the arrogant kind propagated by Syndicalists, and Liberals before them. No, we are on the cusp of something great, godly and good. The flame is, however, weak. We cannot allow our faith to be smothered in its crib. Holy Scotland will be defended."
SCT_oath_of_loyalty:0 "An Oath Of Loyalty"
SCT_oath_of_loyalty_desc:0 "To protect future generations from heresy we will ensure that all government and educational occupations require an oath to God and the State. Those who refuse will be put before the Lord's judgement."
SCT_christian_science:0 "A Protestant Education"
SCT_christian_science_desc:0 "We’ve shut down the Catholic schools. Barred anyone but practicing Presbyterians from higher education, and now we seek to raise our sons and daughters as the meek people of God that our creator had always intended. Ye, for today is a glorious day, from here on, Scotland will be run by only it’s most righteous, chosen sons."
SCT_purge_unfaithful:0 "Purge The Unfaithful"
SCT_purge_unfaithful_desc:0 "Atheists. Catholics. Episcopalians. Anglicans. These are the four enemies that Scotland must face if we wish to be a strong and unified nation, with the blessing and covenant of God. It is for God to judge them, but to send them to him is up to us. Without further ado, fellow Covenanters; Round them up!"
SCT_boris_johnson:0 "Disband Parliament"
SCT_boris_johnson_desc:0 "Of what good is a decedent and self-serving Scottish Parliament to our movement? How do Liberal, Syndicalist ideas of equality and democracy bring us closer to Christ? The Kirk Council of Elders has decided, it doesn’t. The building will be torn down for the arrogance it represents."
SCT_kirk_parliament:0 "The Kirk Assembly"
SCT_kirk_parliament_desc:0 "Disbanding parliament may be a foolish move. After all, a rubber stamp to legitimise our actions may come in exceptionally useful in cementing ourselves as a beacon of Protestant thought in the North Atlantic. The parliament should instead become an expanded Church of Scotland Council of Elders, only then will we steer the ship towards a more righteous future."
SCT_super_protestants:0 "Protestant Supremacy"
SCT_super_protestants_desc:0 "As we make haste to drive out the last of God’s enemies in Scotland, a new mood has made itself apparent the length and breadth of the country. Our people are at last once again taking pride in their correct and native religion. Scotland is truly witnessing a spiritual rebirth of the kind never seen before. Christ is King!"
SCT_new_people:0 "Covenanter Theology in one County"
SCT_new_people_desc:0 "Despite our newfound conviction in service to Christ the King, it is understood that we inhabit the 20th century. Scotland’s leader must be of flesh and blood in order to rally the people to the lamb of God. We will build our branch of Covenanter theology first in Scotland, and only then export our faith worldwide."
SCT_work_camps:0 "Faith Through Labour"
SCT_work_camps_desc:0 "The Rising was destructive, there is no debating this. Scotland’s economy has to recover before we can implement our radical and godly transformative program. Fortunately there is no shortage of our enemies who'd happily toil rather than be put to the sword."
SCT_work_ethic:0 "Protestant Work Ethic"
SCT_work_ethic_desc:0 "Given the prevalent notion of predestination in our national church, many true believers hold dear that to work hard is to show signs of being one of God’s chosen. As our grip on power continues to grow, these sentiments will too. It is only a matter of time before sloth is eradicated from this land and to do this we must promote the traditional protestant work ethic and expand the labour camps."
SCT_seize_lands:0 "Seize Catholic Lands"
SCT_seize_lands_desc:0 "Many centuries ago, the barbarians across the Scottish Sea flooded into our land after God punished their laziness with famine. Now they seek only to agitate and protest against a regime that puts Christ first. It is clear that these papists are nothing more than a nuisance, let us confiscate their property and turn it over to good Presbyterian men."
SCT_gods_kingdom:0 "God's Kingdom On Earth"
SCT_gods_kingdom_desc:0 "We must spread Covenanter Theology far and wide! Our oppressed brothers in Ulster and the rest of Ireland bear testament to what can happen when the God’s most faithful people are brought under the heel of papists and other enemies of Christ. Our Kingdom will not only be all encompassing, it will be righteous and Godly! Let us spread the message of Christ the King to all corners of the world!"
SCT_call_faithful:0 "A Call To The Faithful"
SCT_call_faithful_desc:0 "Up and down the country, Ministers loyal to the Covenanter movement are making our young men take a second oath to the Solemn League and Covenant. To forever be it’s defender in times of strife, and to act as missionary-soldiers in His Service. We are building an army to save mankind from itself, to bring all the world back into the light."
SCT_prussian_brothers:0 "Our Prussian Brothers"
SCT_prussian_brothers_desc:0 "We have much in common with our Protestant brethren in northern Germany. We should be thankful that Prussia is ruled by a joint church of Calvinists and Lutherans. While we consider Lutheranism merely another unreformed faith, there are those industrialists in Germany who follow the correct Calvinist path. We will consult with them for economic aid between two anti-papal powers."
SCT_silver_legion:0 "Sons Of The Legion"
SCT_silver_legion_desc:0 "Everywhere in Scotland, the legions continue to grow. What was once the paramilitary wing of the Covenanter Movement, has become a mighty army indeed. And such a mighty army needs arms to fight. We shall reach across the Atlantic to our brothers in faith and let us pray that the Silver Legion sees the light and become our newest benefactor."
SCT_gods_light:0 "In God's Holy Light"
SCT_gods_light_desc:0 "A covenant remade and restored. A people turned back to the right path. All Scotsmen now read from the same Hymn sheet. Christ the King can be heard chanted in streets everywhere in Scotland. Truly, we will witness his second coming soon, and by the grace of God, truly be his chosen people. "

SCT_jacobite_king:0 "A Jacobite King"
SCT_jacobite_king_desc:0 "With it was with help from our gallant allies in Europe that we managed to liberate ourselves from Syndicalist British tyranny. Now it is time for us to show our appreciation. In order to further our ties with the emerging German power in Europe, we seek to crown Rupprecht of Bavaria as King of Scots. Long live King Robert IV of House Stuart-Wittelsbach, forever may a descendent of the Bruce occupy our throne!"
SCT_kings_guard:0 "Establish The King's Guard"
SCT_kings_guard_desc:0 "While some openly welcome the return of a monarchy in Scotland, others are perturbed by the fact that our King is German. A new regiment of Loyal Scotsmen will be created to not only ensure the safety of His Majesty, but also provide a shining example of how our people should rally behind the throne."
SCT_erase_parliament:0 "Erase Parliament"
SCT_erase_parliament_desc:0 "Many of the King's new subjects remain nostalgic for the time of when they were represented by parliament. We must erase these foul memories and ensure that the spectre of democracy haunts us no more."
SCT_royal_council:0 "Empower The Royal Council"
SCT_royal_council_desc:0 "Democracy in Scotland is a fickle thing. Given the instability of the rising, the King has seen fit to order the drawing up of a new Scottish constitution, one that gives him, his privy councillors, and the Church a leading, paternal hand."
SCT_destroy_syndies:0 "Destroy Remaining Syndicalists"
SCT_destroy_syndies_desc:0 "It was not just the factory workers or those who slave away in Scotland’s dockyards who joined with the Syndicalist cause. Those dissatisfied with the land reforms of the old United Kingdom also took up arms against the Empire. Both Highland and Lowland tenant farmers must be brought to heel."
SCT_secret_police:0 "Establish The Special Police Commission"
SCT_secret_police_desc:0 "Opposition to our rule has been greater than expected. To better protect His Majesty and the state, a new special police force that will operate from the shadows has been authorized."
SCT_german_education:0 "Reform The Education System"
SCT_german_education_desc:0 "Scotland’s Universities have long been a place of innovation and useful learning, not just for the natives, but for the world over. Scottish science is known as some of the finest in the world, we would do well to exploit our nation’s talent in this way as best we can."
SCT_legitimacy_crisis:0 "The Legitimacy Crisis"
SCT_legitimacy_crisis_desc:0 "To use his German name, Rupprecht, Duke of Bavaria, was a commander in the Imperial German Army in the First Weltkreig. This has rubbed many of Scotland’s veterans up the wrong way. Not to mention his son's name of Heinrich. We must seek to ensure that the King adopts Scottish mannerisms and the common religion in order to ensure his legitimacy. Rupprecht however, seems upset about himself and his son abandoning Catholicism."
SCT_crush_british:0 "Crush The Unionists"
SCT_crush_british_desc:0 "‘I will gladly learn Scots, but I cannot forsake the religious custom that my family has practiced for centuries.’ The King’s words are telling, and the hard-line Protestant Unionists in Scotland aren’t going to like it. Their days are numbered."
SCT_work_with_british:0 "Reconcile With The Unionists"
SCT_work_with_british_desc:0 "‘If becoming one of Scotland’s faithful brings their people closer to me, then so be it.’ It seems that the King, after much deliberation, has chosen the path of least resistance. He will show the Unionists that the Scottish Church will never be threatened by having a Catholic on the throne. He will meet with Church of Scotland Ministers later this week to be christened a Presbyterian."
SCT_purge_republicans:0 "Purge Republicans"
SCT_purge_republicans_desc:0 "A Scottish Republic is simply not in anyone’s interest. Ideas of Republicanism have spawned not only Syndicalist, but rabid Legionary states all throughout Europe. The noose is more than adequate for all who oppose the King of Scotland."
SCT_assert_independence:0 "Assert Economic Independence"
SCT_assert_independence_desc:0 "While we appreciate all that Germany has done for us, we cannot allow ourselves to become yet another cog in the Mitteleuropa economic project. Membership of the Reichspakt will keep Scotland safe, but economic independence will keep us free."

SCT_scottish_farms_desc:0 "As a result of the rising, the fields lay bare.

Only with a strong agricultural sector can we truly thrive!"

SCT_ban_unions_desc:0 "The Syndicalist menace first reared its ugly head with the support of the trade unions in Scotland. This treachery against any crown cannot be tolerated a moment longer.

SCT_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "The more liberal elements in Germany seem to be crying out for a change to the structure of Mitteleuropa.

SCT_german_grain:0 "Buy German Grain"
SCT_german_grain_desc:0 "Scotland is rich in its ability to produce high quality livestock and livestock related products, likewise with Oats and Barley. More time can be dedicated to the rearing and growing of such fine fayre if we import cheap German grain!"
SCT_invite_companies:0 "Invite German Companies"
SCT_invite_companies_desc:0 "Germany is the world hegemon and while there was a small tumult due to Black Monday there companies are already bouncing back.

SCT_german_oil:0 "German Oil Rights"
SCT_german_oil_desc:0 "Oil keeps the machines of not only war, but civilian life, moving. A great oil field has been discovered northeast of Aberdeen. If exploited properly, Scotland and Europe as a whole could very well be on the cusp of previously untold prosperity in this new and exciting age!"
SCT_scottish_king:0 "A Scottish King"
SCT_scottish_king_desc:0 "A son of the Stuarts, and in turn, a son of the Bruce himself, now again sits upon the throne of Scotland. The Scottish people have put aside their distrust of the German, now considering him and his successors to be as Scottish as they are, if not by blood, but by culture and loyalty to Scotland,"

SCT_socialist_legacy:0 "Maclean's Legacy Lives On"
SCT_socialist_legacy_desc:0 "John MacLean was seen as Scotland’s saviour. In a time mired by civil strife, economic depression, and the molestation of the Scottish Proletariat by an Anglo-Scots Bourgeoise, it was John MacLean who walked through Clydeside with the red banner in his hand, rallying the people to socialism and better lives. Against all demagogues, Liberals, and dictators, Scotland will truly be an uncorrupted worker’s state again."
SCT_highland_campaign:0 "Begin The Highland Campaign"
SCT_highland_campaign_desc:0 "After our successful revolution we were able to banish both Mosely and his goons along with the reactionaries.

SCT_destroy_watch:0 "Destroy The Watch"
SCT_destroy_watch_desc:0 "The Homeland Watch is a nest of reactionary vipers who have been opposed to our rule since its very inception. When Scotland broke free all the poisonous reactionary elements rallied behind MacCormick and his band of thugs. It is time to end them once and for all."

SCT_root_out_unionists_desc:0 "The red flag flies over Glasgow city hall. Legion’s of working men and women descend on Unionist neighbourhoods. Tonight is the night that we end Scotland’s bourgeois religious divide. No longer will Catholics work in poor conditions, nor any Scotsman!"
SCT_secular_state:0 "A Secular State"
SCT_secular_state_desc:0 "Scotland is a land of many religions and faiths and this leads to a bitter sectarian divide, especially between the protestants and the catholic minority.

SCT_scottish_tuc:0 "A Scottish TUC"
SCT_scottish_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union’s Congress was the cornerstone of British democracy before the tyrant Mosley packed it full of his goons. The idea, however, is not flawed. A Scottish TUC will serve the interests of Scotland’s Proletariat better than any bourgeois parliament ever could!"
SCT_punish:0 "Punish The Totalists"
SCT_punish_desc:0 "It was they who destroyed the legacy of MacLean, it was they who made a national rising inevitable, and it was they who allowed the forces of reaction to taint the progressive forces of Socialism in these isles. The Totalists must be brought to trial and pay for what they have done to MacLean’s legacy."
SCT_compromise_with_totalists:0 "Compromise With The Totalists"
SCT_compromise_with_totalists_desc:0 "Is it perhaps the case that our Proletarian brother’s across Scotland and Britain were merely led astray by Mosley and his band of traitors?

SCT_collective_farming:0 "Support The Crofters"
SCT_collective_farming_desc:0 "In recent decades, much of the Lowlands has seen haphazard attempts at Land Reform and even worse attempts to abolish the historical Crofters.

SCT_drilling_efforts:0 "Drilling Efforts"
SCT_drilling_efforts_desc:0 "Black, rich, and bonnie. These are the words used by Hugh MacDairmid to describe the most recent discovery off Aberdeenshire’s shores. No longer will Scotland’s energy needs be met by corrupted Socialist regimes or bourgeois states. Now, the power is in our hands!"
SCT_join_internationale:0 "Join The Internationale"
SCT_join_internationale_desc:0 "Success! The French and other members of the Internationale have welcomed Scotland with open arms. Not only that!

SCT_the_dream:0 "Red Scotland"
SCT_the_dream_desc:0 "The Union of Britain never truly represented Scotland’s workers. Committees stuffed with English and Welsh working men is all well and good, but at last Scotland’s workers truly have a state of their own, and the apparatus of local government to ensure that the snake of Imperialism, be it revisionism from our allies or a power across the sea, never touches our shores again."

SCT_revive_culture:0 "Revive Scottish Culture"
SCT_revive_culture_desc:0 "A defining characteristic of the Lowland Scot is his loyalty. The unionists are jubilant, and the nationalists uneasy.

SCT_accomodate_unionists:0 "Accommodate Unionists"
SCT_accomodate_unionists_desc:0 "Scotland’s Unionists have endured some tough times. The revolution saw the proscription of Unionist fraternal organisations and the suppression of Protestant churches, and the rising made them feel more distant from their British brethren than ever.

SCT_purge_syndies:0 "Arrest Leftist Agitators"

SCT_parliament_question: "The Question Of Parliament"
SCT_parliament_question_desc:0 "Who should hold supreme power in Scotland? A nation still besieged by republican, separatist, and syndicalist influences cannot stand.

SCT_iedc_aid:0 "IEDC Aid"
SCT_iedc_aid_desc:0 "The Imperial Economic Development Corporation is an integral part in keeping the Empire not only prosperous, but also united in purpose.

SCT_silence_nats:0 "Silence The Nationalists"
SCT_silence_nats_desc:0 "The radical McLeod could have been useful to Britain in another life, but the reality remains, his movement is nothing but a source of religious and nationalist agitation.

SCT_governor_powers:0 "Establish The Governor's Powers"
SCT_governor_powers_desc:0 "Until we retake Britain, an appointed and somewhat authoritarian governor rules over Scotland. A necessary and unfortunate evil. A petition has reached his desk calling for democratic reform to show the good, loyal British men to the south that we will forever uphold British values. On the contrary, elements within the military and nobility believe this is just a scheme by the nationalists and that the status quo must be maintained."
SCT_prepare_integration:0 "Prepare For Integration"

### Events ###

scotland.1.t:0 "Assessing The Economy"
scotland.1.d:0 "With Scotland being thrust into independence, it is safe to say that our economy is still young, stagnating and without direction. While the government has authorized plans to get the economy somewhat moving we will have to decide what direction to take. Some in the government argue we should look to the example set by the Crofters and Scotland's agrarian past. Our population is not big and making Scotland the breadbasket of the aisles would certainly alleviate this issue. However, others argue we should steer the economy towards industrialization."
scotland.1.a:0 "Agricultural reform sounds like a good idea!"
scotland.1.b:0 "Making the mountains black with smog is the way!"

scotland.2.t:0 "Buying Submarines"
scotland.2.d:0 "Rather than invest in a huge navy we have decided instead to focus on constructing a smaller, u-boat based navy. And rather than burden our shipbuilders the navy has proposed that we instead buy old surplus units. While obsolete they will come at a cheap price and can easily be retrofitted and reverse engineered till we can make our own."
scotland.2.a:0 "We won't turn down a good deal!"
scotland.3.t:0 "Naval Budgetary Issues"
scotland.3.d:0 "Representatives of the navy have informed the government that the costs incurred by the naval investment program are reaching a breaking point and are no longer sustainable before requesting a bailout of the navy and increased funding. While the ministry of finance and the army are opposing any increase in the budget, the navy argues that without such it would cause a major defensive breach."
scotland.3.a:0 "We can't afford this, refuse the bailout."
scotland.3.b:0 "It's too dangerous, grant the bailout!"
scotland.4.t:0 "The Navy Recovers"
scotland.4.d:0 "While it has been long and painful, after various cost-cutting exercises and reducing the naval program, the naval budget has come back under control. While the navy will never risk bankruptcy again, some question if the cost was too high."
scotland.4.a:0 "A price to pay for a stable economy."

scotland.5.t:0 "Germany 'Asks' For A Restoration "
scotland.5.d:0 "With Scotland now fully independent and a member of the Reichspakt, the German Ambassador has requested a meeting with provisional president John MacCormick. In the meeting the German delegation outlined a request for a Jacobite restoration of King Rupprecht of Bavaria to the throne of Scotland with his son Heinrich as regent. The Jacobite monarchy in Scotland has been dead for centuries and to many Scotsman the very notion of such a return is bewildering at best. To agree to such a proposal would inevitably disgrace the government but at the same time it is clear the Germans will not take no for an answer..."
scotland.5.a:0 "Reluctantly agree."
scotland.5.b:0 "Tell them to shove it up their arse."
scotland.6.t:0 "Germany Coups The Government"
scotland.6.d:0 "Angered by the lack of interest in a restoration, Germany has given the greenlight to their troops on our soil to overthrow the provisional government and install Rupprecht as a puppet king. We now find ourselves deep under the german boot and many Scotsmen wonder what this will mean for their country."
scotland.6.a:0 "Long Live The King!"
scotland.7.t:0 "Canada 'Asks' For A Restoration"
scotland.7.d:0 "With Scotland now fully independent and a member of the Entente, the Canadian Ambassador has requested a meeting with provisional president John MacCormick. In the meeting the Canadian delegation outlined a request for a full restoration of King [CAN.GetLeader] to the throne with Scotland being incorporated into a provisional British Government. However, some members of the delegation indicated they would agree to a restoration of the Union of Crowns, at least until Britain itself is fully conquered. The entire delegation has agreed that they are prepared to grant home rule once Britain is taken. To agree to such a proposal would inevitably disgrace the government but at the same time it is clear the Canadians will not take no for an answer..."

scotland.7.b:0 "We kicked your lot out once, we'll do it again"
scotland.8.t:0 "Canada Coups The Government!"
scotland.8.d:0 "As expected the Canadian troops garrisoned in Scotland have couped us, arresting MacCormick and dissolving the government with the aid of much of the Conservative and Unionist Party. With Scotland now under British control we must decide whether to establish a British provisional government or a Scottish state under King [CAN.GetLeader] and the Unionists?"
scotland.8.a:0 "Empower the occupation authorities!"
scotland.8.b:0 "Reward the unionists!"
scotland.9.t:0 "The Provisional Government"
scotland.9.d:0 "Now that the English yoke has been overthrown, John MacCormick has handed power to a civilian, provisional government headed by a coalition of all the main democratic parties as well as some representatives from the Homeland Watch's political organization, the NPS. Noticeably the syndicalists are absent as they have at the moment refused to take part. Elections have been planned to be as soon as possible so that life can return to normalcy."
scotland.9.a:0 "Bless ya John!"
scotland.10.t:0 "The Syndicalists Protest The Government"
scotland.10.d:0 "As expected the syndicalist Scottish Trade Union Congress and the affiliated Scottish Workers Federation have protested the government. The syndicalist leader, Willie Gallacher has given a fiery speech in Glasgow pouring scorn on the Provisional Government claiming it is nothing more than a puppet than the Watch. In the final part of his speech he called on Scottish workers to everywhere to rise up and install a syndicalist government."
scotland.10.a:0 "The truce is dead"
scotland.11.t:0 "The Syndicalists Attempt A Coup"
scotland.11.d:0 "As we feared the syndicalists have attempted to overthrow our government. Across the nation a general strike has been called and syndicalist militias have begun openly attacking the police and our fledgling army. The militias in Edinburgh are ready to strike and unless something happens the government will fall."
scotland.11.a:0 "The government collapses!"
scotland.11.b:0 "Call on the Homeland Watch!"
scotland.11.c:0 "Send out a message to the Scottish people!"
scotland.12.t:0 "Watch Reinforcements Arrive!"
scotland.12.d:0 "After the emergency call was put out, the Homeland Watch has diverted all its efforts to fight the syndicalists. With a major confrontation in the cities nobody can be sure who will win."
scotland.12.a:0 "The Syndicalists are subdued!"
scotland.12.b:0 "The Syndicalists beat back the Watch!"
scotland.13.t:0 "What Now?"
scotland.13.d:0 "With the Syndicalists destroyed once for all the Provisional Government is safe, for now at least. With no major opposition and the state still weakened and in shock, many highranking Watch members feel a firm hand is necessary until Scotland is ready for democracy."
scotland.13.a:0 "The Homeland Watch coup the Provisional Government"
scotland.13.b:0 "The Homeland Watch stand down"
scotland.14.t:0 "The Syndicalists Crush The Government"
scotland.14.d:0 "With few Scotsmen turning out to the call and the Watch finding it too late to respond, the syndicalists have successfully destroyed the Provisional Government, once for all, ensuring the dream of socialism in Scotland is not dead yet."
scotland.14.a:0 "Yay...?"
scotland.15.t:0 "The Democrats Fight Back!"
scotland.15.d:0 "Just as the syndicalist militias were ready to coup the government, thousands of Scotsmen formed into impromptu militias and fought back against the syndicalists in the name of the Provisional Government with the Homeland Watch managing to provide reinforcements just in time. It seems that democracy in Scotland is not dead yet!"
scotland.15.a:0 "Hurray!"
scotland.16.t:0 "Dealing With The Covenanters"
scotland.16.d:0 "During the uprising the Homeland Watch government purged the democratic elements, ensuring that in the ensuing peace, Scotland would be democratic when it was ready for such liberty. The radical far-right Covenanters helped secure the victory and now that peace has been attained the Homeland Watch is unsure what to do with them."
scotland.16.a:0 "Purge them before they get too powerful"
scotland.16.b:0 "Keep using them for now"
scotland.17.t:0 "The Battle Of Edinburgh"
scotland.17.d:0 "It seems MacCormick's decision to keep using the Covenanters was a grave mistake as they have launched a major attack on Homeland Watch bases in Edinburgh. While poorly equipped they have a high morale and a ferocious battle spirit. As rumours of them decapitating and mutilating anyone they capture, desertions have taken place en masse as the Homeland Watch units melt away."
scotland.17.a:0 "True God-fearing men win the struggle!"
scotland.17.b:0 "MacCormick rallies the men and repulses the Covenanters!"

scotland.18.t:0 "The Elections Begin"
scotland.18.d:0 "With stability finally returning to Scotland, the elections are finally ready to be called with much excitement over the future of Scotland. Despite a multitude of smaller parties in the running, most analysts see this as a fight between the more liberal and market-orientated Scottish Democrats led by Philip Kerr, campaigning on the promise of bringing back liberalism to Scotland in both domestic life and economics. Their main challenge is from [SocDem]'s Labour Party. While not embracing the syndicalism of the Union of Britain, they wish to maintain some of the more moderate syndicalist policies and keep Scotland firmly left-wing while embracing democracy. In more minor runnings the Conservative and Unionist Party are campaigning on a similar policy of the Scottish Democrats but with autonomy for the Unionist areas. The Crofter Party has also entered the race, vowing to undo the harsh farming collectivization policies and return to the traditional Crofter practices. Neither of these two are expected to win outright due to their narrow appeal but they two would form a coalition with one of the bigger parties."
scotland.18.a:0 "How terribly exciting!"
scotland.19.t:0 "The Results Are In!"
scotland.19.d:0 "The results are in and it's not good news for either parties. Neither party has managed to win an outright majority and it seems that they'll have to form a coalition if one of the smaller parties. The decisive factor however is which party won the most seats."
scotland.19.a:0 "The Scottish Democrats win the most seats!"
scotland.19.b:0 "The Labour Party won the most seats!"
scotland.20.t:0 "The Scottish Democrats Seek A Coalition"
scotland.20.d:0 "With the Scottish Democrats winning the most seats in parliament they have begun seeking out coalition partners. While some smaller parties have pledged support, these account for a few seats at best and the Democrats will have to court either the Unionists or the Crofters. The Unionists are the obvious choice but are clear that their main demands will be unconditional autonomy for the Unionists, a bitter pill to swallow for many nationalists who worry it will divide the nation. The other option is the Crofter Party, assuming talks with the unionists fail but they could refuse to work with the pro-business Democrats."
scotland.20.a:0 "Open negotiations with the Unionists"
scotland.21.t:0 "The Negotiations Begin"
scotland.21.d:0 "Philip Kerr has met with the Unionist leader Tam Galbraith to begin discussions over a potential coalition. Galbraith and the Unionists, as expected, have pressed their desire for autonomous zones and communities for the Unionists, with some even proposing a separate unionist parliament. Many in the Scottish Democrats are skeptical of such plans and while everyone is in agreement the Unionists have to be accommodated in some form, these proposals are seen as too radical and would afford the Unionists too much power. If we buckle now it'd break the stalemate but would afford them much power in government. Some of supporters are proposing we break off the negotiations and attempt to work with the Crofters."
scotland.21.a:0 "Agree to their demands"
scotland.21.b:0 "Push for a compromise"
scotland.21.c:0 "Kick Galbraith out and speak to the Crofters"
scotland.22.t:0 "Pushing For A Compromise"
scotland.22.d:0 "Rather than simply give into the Unionists, the Democrats have begun pushing for a compromise option with some level of accomodation now but deferring the talks of unionist autonomy to the future. Now all rests on the Unionists and whether or not they will agree to such a proposal."
scotland.22.a:0 "Quite a tense moment..."
scotland.23.t:0 "The Unionists Agree!"
scotland.23.d:0 "In a dose of great news, the Unionists have agreed to the compromise, curbing their influence in government but providing valuable support while putting off the toxic issue of Unionist autonomy, for now at least."
scotland.23.a:0 "Hurray!"
scotland.24.t:0 "The Talks Fail"
scotland.24.d:0 "As expected the talks have collapsed with the Unionists being removed and pouring scorn on the Scottish Democrats, refusing to work with them in the near future. Panic is taking centre and many fear a minority government though some maverick politicians have proposed salvaging a coalition and working with the Crofter Party."
scotland.24.a:0 "Form a minority government"
scotland.24.b:0 "Attempt to talk with the Crofters"
scotland.25.t:0 "The Unionists Refuse A Compromise"
scotland.25.d:0 "The Unionists have refused any form of a compromise making it clear that this is their final offer and that they will accept nothing short of what is on the table.

scotland.26.a:0 "A minority government it is then"
scotland.27.t:0 "The Crofters Agree"
scotland.27.d:0 "Surprisingly the Crofters have agreed to open negotiations with us though they are driving a hard bargain. They are demanding subsidies for the Crofters and protection from our austerity policies as well as vowing that there will be no compromise. We could form a minority government but this could backfire badly."

scotland.28.a:0 "Open negotiations with the Crofters"
scotland.29.t:0 "The Negotiations Begin"
scotland.29.d:0 "James Maxton has met with the Crofter leader, Jean Mann to begin discussions over a potential coalition. Mann and the Crofters, as expected, have pressed their desire for subsidies, protection of the Crofter way of life and an advancement of civil rights for women. While this is generally in tune with Labour's own policy, the primary concerns are that the Crofters may take the credit for the policies and take too much power in government. Some of the more socially conservative members of our party have also proposed softening the women's rights issue. If we buckle now it'd break the stalemate but would afford them much power in government. Some supporters are proposing we break off the negotiations and attempt to work with the Unionists."

scotland.34.d:0 "Citing our pro-independence policies, the Unionists have turned us down and ruled out working with us in the near future. This combined with our refusal to work with the Crofters means we have no choice but to form a minority government."
scotland.34.a:0 "Looks like we'll have to form a minority government"
scotland.35.t:0 "The Unionists Agree"
scotland.35.d:0 "Surprisingly the Unionists have agreed to open negotiations with us though they are driving a hard bargain. They are demanding autonomy for the Unionists and the possibility of a second parliament, as well as vowing that there will be no compromise. We could form a minority government but this could backfire badly."
scotland.35.a:0 "Give in to their demands"
scotland.35.b:0 "Refuse and form a minority government"

scotland.36.t: "Dealing With The Syndicalists"
scotland.36.d:0 "The syndicalists have always been opposed to our rule and infamously contested the Provisional Government. While they are now, for the most part dealt with, their legacy lingers and they still carry widespread support in urban areas. As such we must decide how to handle the remaining syndicalists either via an amnesty or by cracking down harsly."
scotland.36.a:0 "Grant an amnesty"
scotland.36.b:0 "Begin the crackdown"
scotland.37.t:0 "The End Of The Amnesty"
scotland.37.d:0 "With the amnesty period finally over, the syndicalists have been peacefully reintegrated into civil society. Many have come to accept, or at least tolerate our rule and the syndicalist threat has been forever dealt with."
scotland.37.a:0 "Hopefully that's the last of them."
scotland.38.t:0 "The Crackdown Begins"
scotland.38.d:0 "Using elements of the police, military and ex-Homeland Watch forces, we have begun a brutal crackdown against syndicalists forces beginning in the most populated areas of the country such as cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. It seems many of the syndicalist supporters are fleeing to the North to escape the police, or south to the Union of Britain. Within time we will finally destroy the red menace."
scotland.38.a:0 "Stop right there syndicalist scum!"
scotland.39.t:0 "The Crackdown Heightens"
scotland.39.d:0 "As the crackdown has intensified, many of the syndicalist supporters and their leaders have fled the most urban areas to take hiding in the smaller towns and villages, or in same cases fleeing the border to Britain. For now this is but a temporary issue and while the issue of the syndicalists remain, it is but a minor nuisance."
scotland.39.a:0 "Better bothering the English than us, eh?"
scotland.40.t:0 "The Highland Hunts"
scotland.40.d:0 "As the syndicalist raids get more and more intensive, they are losing ground across the country, with many of their supporters being arrested or fleeing the country altogether. Those who remain have abandoned the urban areas and the south all together, now fleeing for the Northern highlands to carry out a guerilla warfare campaign from the mountains. Being so few in number and with the population hostile to them, it won't be long till the ugly head of syndicalism is beaten once and for all."
scotland.40.a:0 "The hills have eyes you know..."
scotland.41.t:0 "Cleansing The Northern Isles Of Syndicalism"
scotland.41.d:0 "When we initially broke off the Northern islands remained loyal to Britain as the local Maximist enforcers were able to crush any dissent. This has left a lasting legacy of syndicalism and many of the socialists are fleeing to the islands in the hope of finding refuge there. It seems that their end is near."
scotland.41.a:0 "Send them on a Shetland cruise"
scotland.42.t:0 "The End Of The Crackdown"
scotland.42.d:0 "In a dusty old cottage on the Shetland Coast, the leader of the syndicalists Willie Gallacher was looking out to the sea. Himself, the Scottish Workers Federation leader Jennie Lee and some of their few remaining supporters were trapped on this wretched island waiting to receive safe passage to the continent. Only before they could make such a journey the cottage was raided by the coast guard with both leaders being arrested and sent for trial on the mainland. With the leaders captured and the syndicalist spirit broken, we have finally overcome the red menace."
scotland.42.a:0 "Hurray!"
scotland.43.t:0 "Reforming The Electoral System"
scotland.43.d:0 "Scotland’s current system of parishes and cities comes from a vastly outdated view of the country and was formed when we laboured under the English yoke. A bill has just passed in parliament to reform this old system by transferring to a new 3-tier system of county councils, burghs, and regions. A more democratic and accountable system has been created as Scots everywhere cheer for their democracy."
scotland.43.a:0 "Jolly good lads!"
scotland.44.t:0 "What To Do With The Homeland Watch"
scotland.44.d:0 "The Homeland Watch is an anomaly in Scotland. While they helped fight off the British and helped protect our democracy from the syndicalists, many of their members advocate authoritarian rule in Scotland and occasionally there are whispers of a planned coup. While the public face of the Watch, John MacCormick is adamant that their duty is to the Scottish people and as such Scottish democracy, the democrats are naturally skeptical. It also raises major issues as a paramilitary group is giving free reign to wander the nation. While they do provide somewhat of a service, they are seen as a very credible threat to our democracy. Some propose using them whereas others believes we shoud eliminate them."
scotland.44.a:0 "Use them, they could be valuable later on..."
scotland.44.b:0 "Disband them, they've served their purpose."
scotland.45.t:0 "Dealing With Sectarian Strife"
scotland.45.d:0 "Like in Ireland, Sectarian Strife between Catholics and Protestants has plagued the nation. Even worse divides between protestants is common and the sectarian violence has often transcendent religious and political barriers, infamously going as deep into football rivalry. While this is no easy issue to fix, the current government is undertaking policy of mending the divides and uniting the nation beyond mere religion."
scotland.45.a:0 "It's all the same chap in the sky, eh?"
scotland.46.t:0 "The Unionist Negotiations"
scotland.46.d:0 "Negotiations have begun with the Unionists to attempt to better accommodate them in the nation. While some of their demands have been seen as outlandish, many are prepared to work with the new state and have accepted the unlikeliness of returning to life under the King of a United Kingdom. While the negotiations are likely to be hard and long, compromise will be the key to satisfying everyone."
scotland.46.a:0 "Compromise in politics is an artform."
scotland.47.t:0 "The Unionists Agree!"
scotland.47.d:0 "The negotiations have succeeded and while there have been some grumbles about the new benefits afforded to the unionists, everyone is pleased with the result and they are prepared to work and accept the new state. While some of the extremists will never accept Scottish rule, many are finally accepting the political reality and the Unionist issue has been solved."
scotland.47.a:0 "Great news!"
scotland.48.t:0 "The Unionists Stall"
scotland.48.d:0 "The Unionists have been slow to respond and appear to be stalling the negotiations, often making outlandish demands and at times threatening to walk out. While it is clear even they don't expect to see their demands met, it is causing low morale under our negotiating team, many of whom no longer see the point in trying to work with the Unionists."
scotland.48.a:0 "Come on lads, you can't give up yet!"
scotland.49.t:0 "An Agreement Reached!"
scotland.49.d:0 "The negotiations have succeeded and while there has been much grumbling about the new benefits afforded to the unionists, everyone is pleased with the result and they are prepared to work and accept the new state. While some of the extremists will never accept Scottish rule, many are finally accepting the political reality and the Unionist issue has been solved."
scotland.49.a:0 "We got there in the end!"
scotland.50.t:0 "The Talks Break Down"
scotland.50.d:0 "With little movement from either side, the worse has come to bear and the Unionists have left the negotiations, seeing them as pointless. Our own supporters also see little reason to carry on and a general sense of animosity among both sides is rising rapidly."
scotland.50.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?"
scotland.51.t:0 "An Agreement Salvaged!"
scotland.51.d:0 "While not particularly ideal with our hand bending to the Unionists, the talks have been salvaged and an agreement has been reached. While our own supporters are not particularly pleased with the benefits the Unionists now have, we have managed to avert a major political crisis."
scotland.51.a:0 "Better than a civil war!"
scotland.52.t:0 "Unionist Tensions Inflamed"
scotland.52.d:0 "With the collapse of the talks, the unionist tensions have been inflamed, with open fighting between unionists and nationalists, with some more extreme elements calling for open rebellion. Unionist MPs are threatening to leave parliament and animosity between unionists and nationalists is at an all time high. While a civil war is unlikely, these tensions will not go away for a long, long time."
scotland.52.a:0 "Bloody hell lads, can't you all calm down?"
scotland.53.t:0 "Unionist Protest Ends In Violence"
scotland.53.d:0 "Another Unionist protest, demonstrating against the Nationalist government has ended in violence after nationalists arrived to conduct a counter protest. Despite the best efforts of the police to keep the two separated it ultimately came down to violence and sprawled into a large melee. Though no one is likely to have died, many have been wounded and hospitalized with the Unionists using this against our government and further straining relations."
scotland.53.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?"

scotland.54.t:0 "Rule By The Watch"
scotland.54.d:0 "Democracy is ultimately the goal of many Watch members and the Watch leaders know it is good for Scotland. But if the revolt taught us anything it is that Scotland is not ready for democracy, not yet anyway. English tyranny has seeped into the core and the democrats do not know how to rule with an iron fist when it is needed. The spectre of syndicalism still haunts Scotland and until all threats to our new state our destroyed then there can be no democracy."
scotland.54.a:0 "Long Live President MacCormick!"
scotland.55.t:0 "Dealing With Parliament"
scotland.55.d:0 "Scotland is not a total dictatorship. A provisional parliament was established when we broke off with plans to hold elections after we gained independence. While this is ultimately within our long term aims, for now parliament will be allowed to exist, albeit defanged and unable to really have any affect on policy until we deem parliament ready to be worthy of its name."
scotland.55.a:0 "Guided democracy, is still democracy"
scotland.56.t:0 "Reforming The Education System"
scotland.56.d:0 "One of the more ambitious plans of the new Scottish state under the Watch, is a revival of Scottish traditions and culture. For too long England has supplanted our ancient customs and forced us to assimilate into their own practices. With the children taught true Scottish history we will promote a national renaissance of the Scottish culture and tongue."
scotland.56.a:0 "New textbooks all around!"
scotland.57.t:0 "The Revival Of The Scots Tongue"
scotland.57.d:0 "Over time, the traditional Scots tongue has slowly died off, being relegated to isolated speakers in the lowlands with Scotland as a whole being anglicised from outside leading to the slow death of our ancient tongue. One of the more ambitious plans of the Homeland Watch is the revival of the Scots tongue. While it is nowhere near to the level of English spoken, the language is on the increase with many Scots learning it as their second language and it slowly entering daily life."
scotland.57.a:0 "An-asgaidh aon uair eile!"
scotland.58.t:0 "The Implementation Of Martial Law"
scotland.58.d:0 "Our ascent to power has not been particularly orderly and many opponents of the regime in the democrats, the syndicalists and the Covenanters still walk free, openly agitating against our regime. Much of the Watch agrees that we should continue ruling directly through the military wing of the Watch and enact martial law to better consolidate our regime. However some of the more liberal elements of the Watch believe that we should maintain civilian law and begin ruling through the civilian wing of the Watch."
scotland.58.a:0 "Enact martial law!"
scotland.58.b:0 "Switch over to a civilian administration"
scotland.59.t:0 "Martial Law Gets Results!"
scotland.59.d:0 "Our new policy of martial law has been getting good results. Much opposition to our rule has been silenced with vile socialist protests crushed paving the way to destroy them once for all. Across the nation, enemies of Scotland fear retribution of the iron fist. While the moderates within the Watch worry about the long-term effects this may have on Scotland, we know that is an unfortunate necessity."
scotland.59.a:0 "Stop right there criminal scum!"
scotland.60.t:0 "The End Of Martial Law?"
scotland.60.d:0 "Our policy of martial law has been wildly successful, seeing the arrest of many enemies of the state in special Watch-administered courts. With much of these enemies in prison or dead, some in the Watch believe it is time to repeal the repressive policies and pave the way for democratic rule in the future. However, other members of the Watch believe to repeal it now would only empower our enemies."
scotland.60.a:0 "Repeal martial law!"
scotland.60.b:0 "Keep it in place"
scotland.61.t:0 "Transitioning To Civilian Government"
scotland.61.d:0 "The martial law debate has seen the more moderate elements of the Watch win out over the more extremist elements. With the lack of martial law, President MacCormick has agreed to transition to a civilian administration with the political wing of the Watch, the National Party of Scotland, taking over until elections can be held. While this is not a transition to democracy, far from it, it does show a change of attitudes in the Watch leadership."
scotland.61.a:0 "Better start campaigning!"
scotland.62.t:0 "The 'Election'"
scotland.62.d:0 " After having recently transitioned from a civilian government, the Homeland Watch civilian wing has mandated new elections. A multitude of practices have been put in place to ensure that the NPS has returned a major victory. John MacCormick has given a speech to parliament in which he has announced he will be stepping down. Despite this, all leaders of the parties have pleaded for him to stay on as the true protector of Scotland. 'Reluctantly' MacCormick has agreed to stay on."
scotland.62.a:0 "Oh well if you insist..."
scotland.63.t:0 "Unity Through Faith"
scotland.63.d:0 "One of the most pressing issues that faces Scotland is the sectarian strife that plagues the nation. This strife has infected all elements of Scottish society, infamously going as far as to permeate football rivalries. While there is no easy solution, President MacCormick, himself a devout christian, has toured various protestant and catholic churches across the country promoting religious peace between the faiths and a unity to the new Scottish nation."
scotland.63.a:0 "One of God's own children, he is!"
scotland.64.t:0 "The Question Of The Crofters"
scotland.64.d:0 "Crofting is a semi-collective method of farming, pioneered by the Scots in the Highland mountains and is an important part of our history. Under the Union, the British went out of their way to destroy the Crofters and fully collectivize the farming. With our recent developments in the highland regions many are protesting our plans and demanding we provide support to their way of life. While supporting them would damage our housing plans, not supporting them would go against our ethos."
scotland.64.a:0 "Forcibly settle them in the new towns"
scotland.64.b:0 "Move them into the towns but let them keep their practices alive"
scotland.65.t:0 "The Prorogation Of Parliament"
scotland.65.d:0 "While democracy is the long-term aim of the Watch government, this seems to slip further every day. Many of the Watch members have accepted that democracy may never come to Scotland, whereas others believe this period of political tutelage is not yet ready to go. Regardless of where they stand the Watch Dictatorship has been centralized to even greater levels with martial law being made indefinite. In a grand speech to speech to the Scottish parliament, John MacCormick announced that parliament is to be prorogued sine die as was the original Scottish parliament, to thunderous applause."
scotland.65.a:0 "Long Live President MacCormick!"
scotland.66.t:0 "The Restoration Of Democracy"
scotland.66.d:0 "In an unexpected address of parliament, president MacCormick has announced that it is due to be prorogued. Many parliamentarians worried this day would come and were prepared to leave their seats for the final time before MacCormick announced his plans to hold snap elections as well as a full restoration of democracy. To thunderous applause parliament was prorogued and across the nation Scots everywhere weep with joy as the light of democracy once more shines upon our nation."
scotland.66.a:0 "The dream has been achieved..."
scotland.67.t:0 "The Elections"
scotland.67.d:0 "The elections have finally come and there is much excitement! The favourites to win are John MacCormick and his socially conservative National Scottish Party competing against Philip Kerr and his Scottish Democrats. On the left both are facing much competition from Jean Mann's Crofter Party and James Maxton's Labour Party. As the results come in the winner is..."
scotland.67.a:0 "The NSP and John MacCormick!"
scotland.67.b:0 "The Scottish Democrats and Philip Kerr!"
scotland.67.c:0 "The Crofter Party and Jean Mann!"
scotland.67.e:0 "The Labour Party and James Maxton!"

scotland.68.t:0 "The Windsor Restoration"
scotland.68.d:0 "The Union Jack flies high across Balmoral as Unionists and Royalists across the country celebrate the return of the rightful King to the throne. Not all is good however as opponents of the agitate left and right for the Republican cause, claiming that Scotland is merely a beachhead for the British. But our King will endure and soon he will be crowned in Westminster!" 
scotland.68.a:0 "Ooo he's so charming!"
scotland.69.t:0 "The Coronation"
scotland.69.d:0 "Too much pomp and fanfare, [CAN.GetLeader] has been crowned King [CAN.GetLeader] II in Edinburgh Castle by representatives of the Church of Scotland before officially opening parliament and passing on power to the Prime Minister and de facto governor-general Tam Galbraith of the Conservative and Unionist Party. Scotland will march forward, brothers with the English once more!"
scotland.69.a:0 "Long Live The King!"
scotland.69.b:0 "Long Live The King and the Governor-General!"
scotland.70.t:0 "Reviving Scottish Culture"
scotland.70.d:0 "Now that we are a Kingdom again there have been calls for a revival of traditional Scottish culture with the reintroduction of crofting as well encouragement of the Scots tongue. While the nationalists are highly in favour of such a revival, the anglophilic elements of our government believe we should not pursue such lofty ambitions and instead seek to promote the status-quo, better easing relations with our Anglo-Canadian benefactors."
scotland.70.a:0 "Agree to the proposals!"
scotland.70.b:0 "Scrap the proposals"
scotland.71.t:0 "Cultural Programmes Bare Results!"
scotland.71.d:0 "It seems our efforts to invest in cultural programs have borne much good fruit, with the Scots tongue being used more in daily life being the most well-regarded of the programme's policies. While there is still a long way to go, many nationalists are happy to see that we have taken their concerns seriously and it seems they will not be as much as a bother in the future."
scotland.71.a:0 "Great News!"
scotland.72.t:0 "The Position Of Parliament"
scotland.72.d:0 "While everyone is in agreement that the new Scottish Kingdom will be a democracy, unlike the original kingdom, there is some speculation as to what parliament's position should be and where executive authority should lie. Some in the Unionists argue that the position of Prime Minister should be empowered and that a more American style government should be formed whereas most of the parties wish to see a parliamentary democracy as was the old United Kingdom's democracy."
scotland.72.a:0 "Empower the Prime Minister!"
scotland.72.b:0 "Empower Parliament!"
scotland.73.t:0 "The Provisional Government"
scotland.73.d:0 "With the Union of Parliaments ratified once more and King [CAN.GetLeader] having been restored the throne of the United Kingdom, Bernard Montgomery has been appointed governor-general of the Provisional Government. With sweeping powers, there is much discontent among the Scots and cries that Scotland is no more than a glorified beach-head are not uncommon. Regardless, Montgomery has promised us he will rule fairly while ensuring nothing now stands in the way of taking back the Union."
scotland.73.a:0 "Bless ya Monty!"
scotland.74.t:0 "The Powers Of The Governor"
scotland.74.d:0 "Currently, Governor-General Montgomery has sweeping and effectively dictatorial powers on behalf of the military government. This has angered the democrats and many Scotsmen wish to see the return of the democracy they enjoyed under the United Kingdom. While relinquishing power to a parliamentary system this early on would be a terrible idea, there have been talks of establishing an Executive Committee to take the place of the general with at least some democratic elements. On the contrary the military regime wishes to see the status-quo maintained and to carry out a purge of subversive elements."
scotland.74.a:0 "Maintain the status-quo"
scotland.74.b:0 "Establish the Executive Committee!"
scotland.75.t:0 "Integrating The Economy"
scotland.75.d:0 "As Scotland will soon be rejoining the UK it is necessary for a policy of rapid desyndicalization to take place as well as preparing Scotland to return to the wider British economy. A more slower integration will be relatively painless but yield less results whereas as a faster integration will be more painful but yield vastly better results."
scotland.75.a:0 "Keep it slow"
scotland.75.b:0 "Full speed ahead!"
scotland.76.t:0 "The Elections"
scotland.76.d:0 "The first elections for the independent Kingdom of Scotland have returned an overwhelming victory for Tam Galbraith and the Conservative and Unionist Party. Unlike those who would see Scotland torn apart by petty nationalism and the corrupting vices of socialism, the Conservatives and Unionists are a true Scottish Party that represent this fine people and fight for this fine land. A toast to our glorious leaders!"
scotland.76.a:0 "Well done on your victory lads!"
scotland.77.t:0 "The Invasion Of Britain"
scotland.77.d:0 "The time has come to reclaim the birthright and take back Britain once and for all. The forts are manned, the trenches dug and the men stand ready. All that remains to do now is is give the call for the invasion."

scotland.81.a:0 "For King and Country!"

scotland.82.t:0 "The Covenanters Ascendant"
scotland.82.d:0 "It was thought unthinkable but the Covenanters rule Scotland! Relegated to the fringes of politics for much of its existence and hunted to the ends of the realm during the years of the British, socialist intrusion. But now Reverend Dr. John White rules Scotland by the mandate of God. Speaking in the centre of Edinburgh, Reverend Dr. White has proclaimed a most sacred victory over the Watch. While necessary during the revolt, they have long outlived their usefulness and so like with all other enemies of God will be put to the sword. One of the most pressing issues on the minds of all Covenanters however is how Scotland should look to the world. THe predominant opinion is that the nation should look inwards and build the Covenanter theology in one country, preserving it for the Chosen People. A small but quickly growing alternative is to thrust head first onto the world stage and find allies in protestants all across the world."
scotland.82.a:0 "Focus on the internal issues"
scotland.82.b:0 "Look to the world"
scotland.83.t:0 "The Great Crusade"
scotland.83.d:0 "While we have decided how our Covenanter theology should be espoused there still remains the issue of the sectarian strife that plagues our nation. Catholics, Jews, homosexuals, Unionists, atheists, socialists and secularists all inhabit this fair land. All heretics that spit upon God's very name. The first of many Divine Orders passed by High Elder Reverend Dr. White, this will open the floodgates of pure wrath, to strike down upon God and Scotland's enemies. Now, the Great Crusade begins!"
scotland.83.a:0 "Alba gu bràth!"
scotland.84.t:0 "The Bureau Of Ecclesiastical And Heretical Affairs"
scotland.84.d:0 "To ensure that Scotland follows the true path of God and to protect the nation from Popery and heretics, High Elder Reverend Dr. White has established the Bureau of Ecclesiastical and Heretical Affairs, often referred to as the BEHA. The Bureau will police all crimes against God such as heresy, atheism, loyalty to the Pope and any other crimes that could threaten the sanctity of the state. While critics call it a secret police, good God-fearing Scots everywhere know that it is necessary in the fight against Popery."
scotland.84.a:0 "Stop right there heretical scum!"
scotland.85.t:0 "The Burning Of The Head Office"
scotland.85.d:0 "During the middle of the night vile actors unleashed a torrent of fire upon the head office of the Bureau of Ecclesiastical And Heretical Affairs. The fire brigade spent the whole night attempting to put out the towering inferno as the police canvassed the public for witnesses of the saboteurs. It seems both efforts were for naught as no names came forward and by the morning the building was little more than a charred remains. While the Bureau has relocated itself, an immediate investigation has begun and it has been determined that agents of the Pope, fearing Scotland's rise have conspired to destroy us from within. With ascent from the highest levels of government, an investigation into the full scale of the Papal Conspiracy is already underway. Who knows what horrors they will find..."
scotland.85.a:0 "All enemies of Scotland will be put to the sword"
scotland.86.t:0 "The Investigation Begins"
scotland.86.d:0 "The Bureau has begun its investigation into the Papal Conspiracy. While this is all in its early stages they claim that it will yield very promising results though many priests worry how deep the rabbit hole will go or how much it will cost. Of course the investigation is not just for the good of Scotland but the whole world. The very fate of Protestantism may lie on the shoulders of the Bureau or at least that's what they say."
scotland.86.a:0 "Godspeed lads!"
scotland.87.t:0 "The Investigation Bears Fruit"
scotland.87.d:0 "After nearly a month of silence the investigation has finally borne fruit. Speaking in front of the Grand Inquiry, a meeting of all the ministers of Scotland, the lead investigators have explained their most recent findings and who is to blame for the burning of the head office..."
scotland.87.a:0 "The investigation is of such a classified level it must be destroyed and never spoken of again!"
scotland.87.b:0 "Hell's client state in Ireland!"
scotland.87.c:0 "The Pope himself!"
scotland.88.t:0 "The Investigation Ends"
scotland.88.d:0 "The investigation, according to the lead investigators is in fact so secret that all documents pertaining to it must be destroyed and never spoken of ever again. To thunderous anger and cries of foulness, they finally relented and explained that the Jewish British Catholic Syndicalist Homosexual Elite based out of London were in fact behind the burning and that all assailants have been killed. This did little to quell the growing anger among the clergyman claiming that this 'explanation' was made up in the heat of the moment and that the commission has achieved nothing. It seems that even Reverend Dr. John White himself feels this explanation was a little too daft and has had the investigators executed and replaced. Despite this the nation has exploded into huge anger the wasteful investigation."
scotland.88.a:0 "That...was odd..."
scotland.89.t:0 "The Irish To Blame"
scotland.89.d:0 "To much surprise it seems that the Papacy itself was not behind the arson attack but rather the Irish! Known for their fiery devotion to the Pope and their rampant persecution of protestants, the Irish are the natural enemies of Scotland. As proclaimed in the report it seems that they are even worse than we thought! Ireland itself is a fake construct, first created as Hell's client state on Earth. While claims that a portal to Hell is underneath the Dáil has not been substantiated yet and many of the priesthood, including Reverend Dr. White himself believe this is all a bit too silly it has been agreed that Ireland are an enemy of Scotland and so any action taken against them is for the greater good."
scotland.89.a:0 "Begin interrogating the imprisoned!"
scotland.89.b:0 "Send agents to uncover the conspiracy!"
scotland.90.t:0 "Opening Up The Camps"
scotland.90.d:0 "When we first came to power much of Scotland's catholic priesthood were immediately sent to concentration camps to labour away until their journey to Hell. It seems that this was a very good idea as members of the commission have started to be interrogated to ascertain how deep the rabithole of this conspiracy goes. While few have any real connection to Ireland if they want to save their lives they better speak and spill all the details of what evil acts the Irish have committed."
scotland.90.a:0 "Better spill the beans..."
scotland.91.t:0 "The Interrogations Bare Fruit"

The holiday is no longer to be observed and taking part in christmas festivities is a now punishable offence. All bakers are to report on those who attempt to purchase yule bread and impersonation of the Saint Nicholaus is a capital crime. Across the nation the public cry out in a mixture of shock, confusion and anger with special police units deployed to quell the unrest. Soon all good Scotsmen will spend the anniversary of the birth of Christ sitting in quiet reflection and thankfulness for our Lord and Saviour and do away with such decadent luxuries of exchanging gifts and partaking in merriment."

The night quickly descended into chaos when it became apparent that Duncan is no medium but a fake and her 'ectoplasm' was made of cheese cloth. While the government has desperately tried to cover up this embarrassing event, it has somehow made its way to the presses and Duncan has been mocked so harshly the government has been forced to arrest her for witchcraft in a show trial and then shortly release her."

scotland.122.t:0 "A Call To The Faithful"
scotland.122.d:0 "Today high Elder Reverend Dr. White has given off a great radio broadcast in which he has called on protestants across the world to take up arms and fight in a grand crusade against the pope and syndicalism. Instead of the orgy of violence and global war that was supposed to break out as High Elder Reverend Dr. White had promised, the reaction has been incredibly muted with the exception of cease and desist order from a small catholic group in England. In another great speech High Elder Reverend Dr. White attempted to provoke the catholic nations into attacking but again this has fallen on death ears with only a few ultra-nationalist dutch protestants taking any interest in the call to arms. This has proved a monumental blow for the government and Reverend Dr. White has demanded an explanation as to why the radio broadcast didn't create the religious war."

scotland.124.d:0 "After the initial Scottish rising, silence seems to have fallen over the highlands at least until today when a Scottish envoy doubling as priest arrived in Hanover wishing to speak with the German government. After being given an audience the envoy explained the rather...odd situation Scotland finds itself in and gave off a delusional list of 'requests' such as interest-free loans, subsidies for business and trade deals beneficial to the Scots as well as help in a future 'crusade against Popery.' The envoy was quickly laughed out of the building and sent back to Scotland with the southern Catholic states pleased that none of their demands were met."
scotland.124.a:0 "How strange"
scotland.125.t:0 "Germany Says No"
scotland.125.d:0 "Our envoy has returned with terrible news! The perfidious Germans have refused our simple requests citing them as 'silly' and 'homicidal'.

scotland.127.t:0 "A Request From Scotland"
scotland.127.d:0 "An envoy from the newly declared Scottish state has arrived in the capital today and is seeking for the Union State to take Scotland under its wing. Their requests are simple ranging from economic investment to military protection before eventually bending off into a full-scale war against catholicism. While Pelley has shown in interest his attempts to lobby the War Powers Committee have failed spectacularly and Charles Coughlin has put a stop to any further discussion."
scotland.127.a:0 "Sorry guys..."
scotland.128.t:0 "The Yanks Refuse Us Too!"
scotland.128.d:0 "In our hour or need the Americans have turned us down. While this man Pelley apparently lobbied to the very for our cause, the money behind the Union State in the form of the War Powers Committee is allegedly filled to the brim with devout Catholics would see Scotland burn before giving us coin. To make matters worse it seems that one of the Pope's own agitators, a priest by the name of Coughlin, bends the ear of Huey Long and ensures that no money will come our way."

scotland.130.d:0 " For many years, Scotland has experienced parliamentary rule under the United Kingdom and during the revolt this was one of their hopeful ambitions for democratic rule. King Rupprecht has not taken kindly to the notion of having to have his and Heinrich's powers restrained and wishes to rule as a traditional Jacobite King unrestrained. Of course our new subjects are not thrilled. Soon they will learn the error of their ways as today marks the beginning of a grand reformation of Scottish society."

scotland.131.t:0 "Dealing With The Old Building"
scotland.131.d:0 "Now that the king has done away with the notion of democratic rule it must be decided what to do with the old building. Used as the seat of local government for Scotland under the Syndicalist government and now it sits in Edinburgh acting as a subversive symbol against our rule. Much of our government believes the building should be reclaimed and be turned into the seat of the King's power. However, the hardliners believe the building should be destroyed to wipe away the notion of democracy in Scotland. How should we proceed?"

Scores of young men have volunteered to join the Homeland Watch and the provisional Scottish army to fight for their home and country while the syndicalist 'government' has rallied syndicalist militia to the cause.

sctrevolt.13.a:0 "Oh bloody hell!"
sctrevolt.14.t:0 "Petitioning Germany"
sctrevolt.14.d:0 "John MacCormick has decided that the best option for a foreign benefactor would be in Germany, the home of our past foe. Scotland would prove to be a good strategic choice for them, in exchange we'll be able to secure our independence from Britain. Of course what should ask for?"
sctrevolt.14.a:0 "Just aid and equipment."

sctrevolt.17.d:0 "Delegates from the newly declared independent Scotland have arrived today, asking for an expeditionary force in their fight against the Union of Britain.

sctrevolt.18.a:0 "That's not good..."
sctrevolt.19.t:0 "Consolidating Our Power"
sctrevolt.19.d:0 "Rather than seek out a foreign alliance it is better to instead look inwards and consolidate our internal support so that we are beholden to no foreign power as we have been for centuries. The natural option is our current allies, the democrats, though many wonder if Scotland is ready for democracy. The other option is recruiting the Covenanters. Ferocious warriors, they have shown a fanatical devotion to the cause and while they could be useful they could be dangerous..."

kar.100.t:0 "History of Karelian Separatism"
kar.100.d:0 "In 1906 in Tammerfors, in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Finland the Union of the White Sea Karelians was established on August 4, 1906 - the national public organization of the Karelian population of Northern Karelia. The Union approved the Statutes, the main goal of which was to unite the kindred Karelian and Finnish peoples inhabiting Olonets and Archangelsk Governorates and to improve the spiritual and material conditions of the White Sea Karelians. The Union of the White Sea Karelians carried on educational activity. Within half a year of its activity there were opened in Karelia five Finnish schools, two mobile schools, a vocational school in the Ukhta settlement, a new illustrated Finnish ABC-book for schools was published, 22 libraries and reading-rooms were opened. Finnish postal and telegraph service officials began to explore the borders in order to open new stations and build new roads to Karelia, a large road from Finland to Arkhangelsk gubernia began to be built.\n\nThe Union representatives traveled to Olonetskaya gubernia, held talks with the local Karelian population, held Lutheran services, distributed and sold gospels, books and brochures of spiritual content in Karelian, Finnish and Russian, provided financial aid to the poor.\n\nRussian authorities saw "pan-Finnish threat" in missionary activity of the Union of White Sea Karelians, as a counterbalance to which Karelian Orthodox Brotherhood was created under the patronage of Olonetsky Governor in the end of November 1907 in Karelia. In 1911 the Union activity was banned, but later it was revived in the form of Karelian Enlightenment Society.\n\nThe Karelian national movement was unstoppable, and in subsequent years their desire for self-determination only intensified, reaching its peak during the Russian Civil War."

kar.0.t:0 "Karelia During Russian Civil War"
kar.0.d:0 "On February 23rd, 1918, while stationed at Antrea, the supreme commander-in-chief of the Finnish army, General Karl Gustav Mannerheim, addressed to his troops with his \"oath of the sword\", stating that he would \"not sheath his sword ... before the last of Lenin's warriors and ruffians had been driven both from Finland and from White Sea Karelia\". On February 27th the government of Finland petitioned Germany, so that Germany, as a country at war with Russia, considering Finland an ally of Germany, would demand that Russia conclude peace with Finland on the basis of the annexation of Eastern Karelia to Finland. The planned border with Russia was to run along the East coast of the Ladoga Lake, the Onega Lake and the White Sea. By the beginning of March the Mannerheim's headquarters worked out a plan of organizing "the national rebellions in Eastern Karelia" and allocated special Finnish military instructors for creating rebellion points. After the signing of the Brest Peace Treaty, the Red Finns were defeated and fled to Karelia.\n\nOn March 15, 1918 General Mannerheim signed the order for three Finnish invasion groups to enter Eastern Karelia and three days later the "Provisional Committee for Eastern Karelia", which was occupied by the Finnish troops, met in the settlement of Ukhta and made a decision to annex Eastern Karelia to Finland. In April-May the Olonets approach was undertaken. To govern the southern parts of Karelia the White Finns set up the Olonets government and formed the Olonets Volunteer Army.\n\nBy the end of 1918, largely thanks to German intervention, Finnish troops were able to approach Petrograd and take Petrozavodsk. However, this was not yet a final victory. Not a single White government in Russia had yet recognized the independence of Finland or Karelia."
kar.0.a:0 "Interesting"

kar.1.t:0 "East Karelian Uprising"
kar.1.d:0 "By the end of 1919, the White Armies took Petrograd, and on January 22, 1920, the Bolsheviks surrendered. Russia ratified the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by signing the new Treaty of Minsk, which forced Russia to recognize the independence of Finland, but did not allow the annexation of Karelia. Finland was an unofficial protectorate of Germany, but the Kaiser did not satisfy all its territorial claims. The Karelian question remained unresolved.\n\nThe causes of the Karelian uprising were the striving for a Greater Finland among the Finnish political elite and the emigrants from Eastern Karelia, the dissatisfaction with the results of the war and the dissatisfaction with the lack of food and the difficult economic situation in Eastern Karelia.\n\nThe ideological inspirers and organizers were the Karelian Enlightenment Community, as well as members of the ultra-nationalist pan-Finnish Karelian Academic Society, Schutzkor and the Brothers in Hate. Most of the uprising participants were Russian Karelians, who had fled to Finland, as well as 550 Finnish volunteers, including 28 officers and military specialists. The support of the uprising was greatest in White Sea Karelia, while in South Karelia the supporters of the Russian power prevailed. At the end of 1921 several armed detachments, calling themselves the forest guerrillas or Metsäsissit, under the leadership of Vasily Levonen alias Ukki Väinämöinen crossed into Russian territory. Soon hostilities began: Karelian-Finnish units destroyed administrative bodies, sought to destroy communications and the Murmansk railroad. At the beginning of 1922 the confrontation reached its climax. Russia formed the Karelian Front, took the offensive from Petrozavodsk and managed to defeat the main forces of the enemy.\n\nIn March Germany officially mediated the negotiations. As a result the Peace of Tartu was signed, which awarded the Parishes of Repola and Porajärvi to the Kingdom of Finland, prevented a full-scale war, and kept East Karelia under Russian rule."
kar.1.a:0 "Interesting"

kar.2.t:0 "Toimikunta and Yrjö Elfvengren"
kar.2.d:0 "The Karelian issue is still unresolved. Karelia was divided between the provinces and was not granted autonomy. The region was desolate and poor, and all active political supporters of independence fled to Finland.\n\nSoon after the end of the uprising the Karelian United Government was formed. He was a Finnish nobleman, a white officer and a hero of the Finnish Civil War. During the same years, together with Savinkov and Goppers, he founded the Union for the Defense of the Homeland and Freedom and was responsible for organizing the struggle against the Bolsheviks near the borders with Finland and led the North Ingermanlandian Regiment and the North Ingrian Republic on the border with Petrograd. \n\nAfter the war he was not granted amnesty by the White Armies as he was considered a separatist and remained in Finland. When a new socialist uprising in Russia became known, Elfvengren, together with the Metsäsissit, crossed the border and founded the new Ukhta Committee, hoping for Finnish support in establishing an independent Karelia."
kar.2.a:0 "Down with Russian Imperialism!"

kar.3.t:0 "Paavo Talvela Sent to Karelia"
kar.3.d:0 "A famous Jäger, participant of the 1922 Karelian Uprising has been sent to [KAR.GetNameDef] by our government in order to organize Jääkäriliike in Eastern Karelia and make sure we have at least someone at our direct subordination in White Karelian lands."
kar.3.a:0 "Wish him luck."

kar.4.t:0 "Paavo Talvela Arrives to Uhtua"
kar.4.d:0 "A famous Jäger, participant of the 1922 Karelian Uprising has arrived today to Uhtua together with his batallion in order to organize Jääkäriliike in Karelia."
kar.4.a:0 "Welcome, General!"

kar.5.t:0 "Provisional Government"
kar.5.d:0 "In Uhtua, General Elfvengren was greeted rather warmly, but soon a delegation from the United Government of Eastern Karelia, led by Paavo Ahava, arrived in the town. They declared that Elfvengren had unauthorizedly set up a committee and demanded that power be transferred into the hands of the "legitimate government.\n\nWe need allies now more than ever, and perhaps we should not turn other members of the Karelian government against ourselves. However, the transfer of power and domestic politics according to Elfvengren is clearly not a priority right now. Thus, the new-found "dictator of Karelia" faced a choice - either to agree with the delegates, but insist on his chairmanship of the government, or to send them back, declaring himself dictator officially."
kar.5.a:0 "We are at war, IKYH makes no sense now!"
kar.5.b:0 "Lead the United Government."

kar.6.t:0 "Diplomatic Ties with Finland?"
kar.6.d:0 "With the strengthening of our power in Karelia, it is necessary to immediately turn to the Finnish government to establish close diplomatic relations and ties. Elfvengren understands the necessity of this step, although he is afraid that this state of affairs will further reinforce the power of Finns and turn Karelia into a Finnish province without autonomy."
kar.6.a:0 "Send a delegation to Helsinki!"

kar.7.t:0 "Establishing Diplomacy with [FROM.GetName]"
kar.7.d:0 "With the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, we invested in the Metsäsissit troops. However, contrary to our plans, they conspired with General Elfvengren, who headed the reconstituted Uhtua Committee. Now their government has turned to us with demands to recognize the independence of Karelia and to establish close ties. On the one hand, recognition of independence would allow Elfvengren to obtain legal grounds for the inviolability of his fiefdom, but on the other hand - can we do otherwise?"
kar.7.a:0 "Recognize [FROM.GetName]!"
kar.7.b:0 "Karelia is our natural claim!"

kar.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Recognized Us!"
kar.8.d:0 "The government of Finland, of course, has recognized our independence. This will make our states closer to each other."
kar.8.a:0 "Splendid!"

kar.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Recognize Us!"
kar.9.d:0 "Rather shockingly, [FROM.GetName] has refused to recognize us as a sovereign nation, referring to the rules of international law. [ROOT.GetLeader] understands that their excuse is just a nonsence, but he got the message, that Finland does not want to see Karelia as something that is not a part of Finland."
kar.9.a:0 "Unbelievable!"

kar.10.t:0 "Jääkäriliike"
kar.10.d:0 "At first, the Jäger movement or Jääkäriliike was an activist initiative in order to obtain military training for Finland's separation from Russia. Between 1915 and 1918 a total of 1,895 volunteers were trained in Germany as Jägers. Most of them became high-ranked officers of the Finnish Royal Army and were awared with Mannerheim Crosses. One of the leaders of Jääkäriliike, Paavo Talvela, participated in 1922 Karelian Uprising, together with his Jäger batallion. Now we are in dire need of Jägers once again. Their help in our struggle for independence should be achieved as soon as possible. However, we should not forget that Jägers are mostly of Pro-Finnish orientation and will oppose any Karelian independence sentiments."
kar.10.a:0 "Their contribution can greatly aid us!"

kar.11.t:0 "Humanitarian Aid From Finnish Red Cross"
kar.11.d:0 "The Finnish Red Cross has sent us humanitarian aid. With the war raging on, their help is much appreciated."
kar.11.a:0 "Thanks to our Finnish brothers!"

kar.12.t:0 "Finns Send Equipment"
kar.12.d:0 "The Finnish government has sent us some weapons and equipment, as well as advisors to cooperate at the frontline. With the war ragin on, their help is much appreciated."
kar.12.a:0 "Thanks to our Finnish brothers!"

kar.13.t:0 "The Metsäsissit Issue"
kar.13.d:0 "The Forrest Guerrillas, Metsäsissit, led by a 80-year old man Vaseli Levonen. He became one of the leaders of the 1922 Karelian Uprising. He became very popular among local Karelians. Levonen was short, stocky and had a long beard, reminding the Karelian peasants of the epic hero of the Karelian epic \"Kalevala\" - the hero Väinämöinen. So his pseudonym appeared - Ukki (Grandpa) Väinämöinen.\n\nBy the end of December 1921 the rebel forces, led by Ukki Väinämöinen, supported by the Finnish volunteers, controlled a large part of the North-Eastern Karelia. Only then the Russian government decided to form the Karelian Front. By the middle of February 1922 when the Russians captured the last stronghold of the rebels - Uhtua village the resistance of Karelian-Finns was completely broken. The rebels, among whom was Vasiliy Levonen, went to Finland.\n\nRecently, together with Yrjö Elfvengren, the Metsäsissit crossed the border and engaged in battles with [RUS.GetAdjective] troops. However, the loyalty of Metsäsissit, directly funded by [FIN.GetNameDef] is questionable. We can either try to disband their forces, which can cause much resistance from them and the Finns, or try to subordinate them under the leadership of Yrjö Elfvengren."
kar.13.a:0 "Disband them, they are becoming dangerous!"
kar.13.b:0 "We cannot risk now, try to subordinate them!"

kar.14.t:0 "Petrozavodsk Captured!"
kar.14.d:0 "Our army has managed to capture the largest Karelian city - Petrozavodsk, which should rightfully be called Äänislinna. While this is an important frontier, together with South Karelia new problems appear. The more or less industrialized South Karelia is predominantly pro-Russian. Moreover, the power in local area is held by the Olonets Regional Committee with Socialist Revolutionary Matveev Andrey as its head since 1922. The workers and peasants of Olonets and Petrozavodsk, especially the ones of Russian nationality are radically against us. We have to deal with them as soon as possible and give them no chance to counter-attack us."
kar.14.a:0 "Socialism won't pass in Karjala!"

kar.15.t:0 "Petrozavodsk Captured!"
kar.15.d:0 "The Karelo-Finnish nationalist armies have managed to capture the largest city in th region - Petrozavodsk. While this can be seen as a serious defeat, we can be sure in South Karelian internal issues. The more or less industrialized South Karelia is predominantly pro-Russia. Moreover, the power in Olonets and Petrozavodsk is held by the Olonets Regional Committee with SR Matveev Andrey as its head since 1922. The workers and peasants of South Karelia are radically against the Karelian nationalists. We must expect a rebellion against Finno-Karelian troops sooner or later."
kar.15.a:0 "Karelia is not yet lost to us."

kar.16.t:0 "Socialists Form Red Guard!"
kar.16.d:0 "After we have captured the Olonets Karelia, the local SRs have rallied workers and peasants to form into Red Guards. Some divisions have already been formed and are now resisting our control of the region!"
kar.16.a:0 "We should crush them!"

kar.17.t:0 "Clashes Between Jägers and Red Guard!"
kar.17.d:0 "The recent events in Olonets have forced the Finnish Jägers to enter into fierce street clashes with the Red Guard. Despite the voluntary organisation of the Red Guards, they became a serious threat to our rule in Olonets, but the outcome of the battle is not yet clear..."
kar.17.a:0 "Jägers defeat the Red Guard and arrest their leaders."
kar.17.b:0 "The Red Guard crushed the Jägers and recaptured Petrozavodsk!"

kar.18.t:0 "Red Guard Takes Offensive to the North"
kar.18.d:0 "After the fall of Petrozavodsk back into Socialist hands, the Jägers were crushed and the Military Revolutionary committee has announced an offensive to capture Uhtua and bring Soviet power to all of Karelia! Some units have quickly reached Uhtua through the Murmansk Railway and have surrounded the town, where our leader, Yrjö Elfvengren, was at the moment. Despite the small number of Red Guards, their sudden encirclement took Elfvengren by surprise, and it seems that he will have to flee to Finland before it is too late..."
kar.18.d.metsasissit:0 "After the fall of Petrozavodsk back into Socialist hands, the Jägers were crushed and the Military Revolutionary committee has announced an offensive to capture Uhtua and bring Soviet power to all of Karelia! Some units have quickly reached Uhtua through the Murmansk Railway and have surrounded the town, where our leader, Yrjö Elfvengren, was at the moment. Despite the small number of Red Guards, their sudden encirclement took Elfvengren by surprise, and it seems that he will have to flee to Finland before it is too late...\n\nFortunately, at the last moment Metsäsissit, led by Ukki Väinämöinen, showed up from the Karelian forests, who were able to quickly seize the initiative and disarm the Red Guards, after which the Soviets lost quite a bit of popular support and were forced to flee into Soviet Russia."
kar.18.a:0 "Elfvengren forced to flee!"
kar.18.b:0 "Metsäsissit destroys the Red Guards"

kar.19.t:0 "Proclamation of the Labour Commune!"
kar.19.d:0 "With all of Karelia secured under the rule of the Red Guards, the long-term leader of the Olonets province, a Socialist-Revolutionary Matveev Andrey, Veps by his nationality, has proclaimed the establishment of the Karelian Labour Commune under the protectorate of [RUS.GetNameDef]."
kar.19.a:0 "Power to the Soviets!"

kar.20.t:0 "Uhtua Assembly"
kar.20.d:0 "Karelia liberated. However, the battle is not yet over. When the last shot of the second Russian Civil War occurs, the Bear will turn his gaze to us and try to take back what does not belong to him. Our Finnish friends are also looking greedily at our lands, preparing to devour the stressed \"sub-ethnos,\" as they call us.\n\nGeneral Elfvengren understands this as well. Now that there is peace in Karelia, however temporary, it is necessary to decide the main question - who is worthy to rule this land. And it seems that there are not many options. In connection with the need to resolve this issue and convened a meeting in Ukhta. Several dozens of representatives of different Karelian organizations will have to vote fairly and impartially for the best authority for Karelia."
kar.20.a:0 "Elfvengren consolidates his rule."
kar.20.b:0 "Elfvengren calls for a constituent assembly."

kar.21.t:0 "Constituent Assembly"
kar.21.d:0 "Soon after Elfvengren put power into the hands of the Provisional Government, it was faced with the fact that, in fact, during the years of rule of supposedly "democratic" Russia, no national party was formed in Karelia, and power was held by Socialist-Revolutionaries throughout the years. Due to the obvious lack of candidates, Elfvengren decided to form his own - the Karelian People's Party.\n\nHis only opponent was the Karelian Enlightenment Society, an organization well-known to the Karelians, earlier called the Union of the White Sea Karelians and extremely popular in the North. In the South, however, both the pro-Russian and the working population were faced with a shortage of candidates. Active campaigning was carried out by the Finnish parties, which, however, called for a vote for the Sivistysseura. Without any real representation of the Russian minority, an electoral block of pro-Russian candidates, 'Venäjän puolue' was formed\n\nFinally Election Day came, and the counting of the votes had already been completed."
kar.21.a:0 "Sivistysseura achieves majority."
kar.21.b:0 "Elfvengren's Kansanpuolue wins the mandate."
kar.21.c:0 "Pro-Russian bloc unexpectedly wins..."

kar.22.t:0 "Jägers Overthrow the Assembly"
kar.22.d:0 "The news of the victory of the leftist pro-Russian government quickly reached all corners of Karelia, and especially the ears of General Talvela, the head of the Finnish Jägers in Karelia.\n\nNot twenty-four hours later, well-armed Jäger units laid siege to Ukhta, where the so-called "government" had gathered and arrested everyone. Soon the general declared the need to return \"order and inter-ethnic peace\" to Karelia and announced the establishment of a new government under Jääkäriliike control and which he himself would lead."
kar.22.a:0 "Karjala on Suomi!"

kar.23.t:0 "Metsäsissit Overthrow the Assembly"
kar.23.d:0 "The news of the election of a new leftist pro-Russian government in Karelia shook the local population to its core. Many even exclaimed: \"couldn't they have faked the results?\"\n\nThe true Karelian patriots - the Metsäsissit led by Ukki Väinämöinen - immediately reacted to the people's discontent.\n\nAlready on the next day the partisan detachments arrested the so-called government, and Väinämöinen announced the calling of a new All-Karelian Assembly."
kar.23.a:0 "We won't tolerate Russians here no more!"

kar.24.t:0 "Karelian Labour Commune"
kar.24.d:0 "The Socialist-Revolutionaries managed to win in Karelia against Karelo-Finnish nationalists and have already established several Red Guard divisions ready to fight for peasants and workers."
kar.24.a:0 "Incredible!"

kar.25.t:0 "Socialists Win in Karelia!"
kar.25.d:0 "The Socialist forces in Karelia managed to defeat troops of Forrest guerrillas and Jägers! We now have to intervene and take these lands by force!"
kar.25.a:0 "Oh no! We cannot lose Karjala!"

kar.30.t:0 "Attempted Jäger Coup"
kar.30.d:0 "The Karelian identity efforts, attempted by our government, were greatly resisted by the Finnish so-called 'Military Nobility', or the Jägers.

kar.33.d:0 "The recent money we have sent to the Academic Karelian Society, in fact, has been used for other matters. The AKS, which advocates for Greater Finland ideas and radically resists the Karelian autonomy status, has tried to seize power in the republic with the help of Metsäsissit."
kar.33.a:0 "Metsäsissit intervene on AKS side"
kar.33.b:0 "Elfvengren intervenes and expels AKS!"

kar.34.t:0 "Attempted AKS Coup in Karelia!"
kar.34.d:0 "The news from [FROM.Capital.GetName] has arrived about an attempted military putsch by the Academic Karelian Society and the Metsäsissit. As far as we now, the AKS has unsuccessfully tried to seize power in Karelia and end all attempts to 'artificially separate Karelian and Finnish peoples'. However, the coup was crushed and the Metsäsissit were disbanded. The AKS had to flee Karelia and stay in Finland with their loyal Lapua masters."
kar.34.a:0 "We have nothing to do with it..."

kar.35.t:0 "AKS Coup in Karelia!"
kar.35.d:0 "The news from [FROM.Capital.GetName] has arrived about a military putsch, led by the Metsäsissit and the Academic Karelian Society. The new government has arrested the democratic government and Yrjö Elfvengren and has declared 'unbreakable ties between Finnish and Karelian nations'. This government is much more pro-Finnish than the previous one, which is very good for us."
kar.35.a:0 "Karjala on Suomi!"

kar.36.t:0 "Sivistysseura and Paavo Ahava"
kar.36.d:0 "The Sivistysseura, a direct successor of the Union of White Sea Karelians, has at first been just an Enlightenment organisation. However, in 1917 they became involved in politics with Paavo Ahava eventually becoming the leader of the political party. The Sivistysseura advocates for Karelian nationalism, but as a part of Finnish state. In other words, they look towards becoming a Finnish autonomy and cutting all ties with the Russian colonisation attempts."
kar.36.a:0 "Interesting."

kar.37.t:0 "1917 Constitution"
kar.37.d:0 "The largest and most representative meeting of the inhabitants of White Sea Karelia took place in Ukhta on July 12-13, 1917. It was a continuation of the earlier struggle for the development of the region and the right to self-government, a real desire to save the region from the impending political and economic chaos in the country. Projects of economic reorganization were sent to the localities in advance. According to these projects, a common border, the same currency, post and army with Russia, as well as a unified law enforcement system and a single legal framework. In the matters of economics, the running of the economy and the organization of local administration, Karelia was granted full autonomy. The assembly approved the program, and it was decided to pass it to the Russian government.\n\nThe Karelia autonomy program was drawn up by Paavo Ahava together with Iivo Härkönen, which can be considered the first constitution of Eastern Karelia. Now, some necessary changes should be made to this program, mainly the unbreakable friendship and ties with Finland and complete independence from Russia."
kar.37.a:0 "Let us adopt a real constitution now!"

kar.38.t:0 "Fate of the Orthodox Church"
kar.38.d:0 "In the Constitution our government has officialy declared freedom of religion. However, the question of the Orthodox congregations of Karelia is still present. There are several suggestions what to do, one of which is to leave everything as it is, meaning to oppose separation from the Russian Orthodox Church. The drawback of this suggestion is that Russia can possibly influence our internal politics through Church. The other choices are to separate the congregations from the Russian Church and possibly join them to the Orthodox Church of Finland or Estonia."
kar.38.a:0 "Our ties are too deep. Stay with Russian Orthodox Church."
kar.38.b:0 "Unite Karelian Orthodox congregations with Church of Finland."
kar.38.c:0 "Choose to unite them with Church of Estonia instead."

kar.39.t:0 "Karelian Autonomy?"
kar.39.d:0 "The Karelian government has approached with a suggestion to discuss their future place within our relationships. The suggestion of [FROM.GetLeader] is to give Karelia a wide autonomy within [ROOT.GetName] and unite it with Finnish Karelia."
kar.39.a:0 "This is a great idea."
kar.39.b:0 "Finnish Karelia shall remain under our rule."
kar.39.c:0 "We can only accept Karelian annexation!"

kar.40.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"

kar.41.d:0 "The Finnish government has willingly accepted our suggestion, but it refused to give Finnish Karjala any special status. How shall we react?"

kar.42.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Refused!"

kar.44.d:0 "With Finnish opinion on our current state, we can now make the final choice - our future."

kar.46.b:0 "We must respect their choice."

kar.47.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Integration!"
kar.47.d:0 "Despite our wishes, the [FIN.GetAdjective] government has insisted on our integration into their state."

kar.48.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
kar.48.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our ultimatum!"
kar.48.a:0 "We have no choice but to use force!"
kar.48.b:0 "We can't initiate war with our Karelian brothers!"

kar.49.t:0 "Separating the Karelian Orthodox Church"
kar.49.d:0 "The question of the Orthodox congregations of Karelia is still present. The choices are to separate the congregations from the Russian Church and possibly join them to the Orthodox Church of Finland, or establish an independent Karelian Orthodox Church instead!"
kar.49.b:0 "Karelian Orthodox Church should be separate and independent!"
kar.49.c:0 "Unite Karelian Orthodox congregations with Church of Finland."

kar.50.t:0 "An Offer From Old Friend"
kar.50.d:0 "Today the Vozhd has received an interesting offer - the one from an old friend of his, who know serves as the [FROM.GetAdjective] Dictator - [FROM.GetLeader].\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, [FROM.GetLeader], together with [ROOT.GetLeader] have establised SZRS - The Union For Defense of Freedom and Motherland, a terrorist anti-Bolshevist organisation that played a vital role in defeating the Reds. While Goppers and Savinkov were busy organizing the Yaroslavl uprising, in the North, [FROM.GetLeader] was leading the Republic of North Ingria, participated in Finno-Soviet Civil War and organized terrorist attack on Bolshevik leaders.\n\nNow, Elfvengren has approached us with an offer to renew our friendly relationship, but this time at the governmental level. He suggested to officially recognize [FROM.GetNameDef]. In return, [FROM.GetLeader] promises to 'help' in defeating the Bolsheviks and bringing back Finland into his sphere. The price is rather low - wide autonomy of Karelia as his personal fiefdom."
kar.50.a:0 "An interesting offer... that Vozhd accepted."
kar.50.b:0 "Is he crazy? This 'offer' even sounds ridiculous!"

kar.51.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Accepts!"
kar.51.d:0 "Our offer was willingly accepted by the Vozhd. We have now signed a secret pact between our nations."
kar.51.a:0 "Splendid!"

kar.52.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Refused!"
kar.52.d:0 "Our offer was rejected by the Vozhd. It seems that our old 'friend' has become too crazy with his idea of restoring Russian greatness!"
kar.52.a:0 "We will cope alone well."

kar.53.t:0 "Karelia Offers Alliance"
kar.53.d:0 "Today we have received an offer from [FROM.GetLeader], dictator of [FROM.GetNameDef]. He suggested that we should sign a treaty of friendship and borders - and join our forces in our fight against Bolshevism."
kar.53.a:0 "We agree!"

kar.54.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Accepts!"
kar.54.d:0 "Our offer was willingly accepted by [FROM.GetLeader]. We have now signed a secret pact between our nations."
kar.54.a:0 "Splendid!"

kar.55.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Refused!"
kar.55.d:0 "Our offer was rejected by [FROM.GetLeader]. It seems that we will have to fight against the Reds alone."

kar.56.t:0 "An Offer From Old Friend"
kar.56.d:0 "Today we have received an offer from [FROM.GetLeader], dictator of [FROM.GetNameDef]. He has approached us with an interesting offer. During the first stages of the Russian Civil War, Elfvengren happened to help the Crimean Tatars in their fight against the Reds and initially securing their independence. Soon enough, unfortunately, Elfvengren have left for Finland, where he participated in the Finnish Civil War. However, the Crimean Tatar people remember good deeds of general Elfvengren and his effort in our struggle for independence. Now he offers us to sign a treaty of friendship. While we are very disconnected in terms of distance, we can still agree to his terms."
kar.56.a:0 "We agree!"

kar.59.t:0 "An Offer From SZRS Confederate"
kar.59.d:0 "Today we have received an offer from [FROM.GetLeader], dictator of [FROM.GetNameDef]. He has approched [ROOT.GetLeader] has his former confederate: together with Savinkov, [FROM.GetLeader] participated in organizing SZRS and terrorist attacks against Bolsheviks. Now his offer is to form a mutual guarantee alliance between our nations."

kar.62.t:0 "An Offer From the Former Ambassador"
kar.62.d:0 "Today we have received an offer from [FROM.GetLeader], dictator of [FROM.GetNameDef]. He briefly served as an ambassador of Belarusian People's Republic to Finland, before the Belarusian Central Rada was dissolved and the German king imposed on us. Now he wants to restore ties between our nations at the governmental level and sign an alliance."

kar.65.t:0 "Elfvengren & Savinkov's SZRS"
kar.65.d:0 "During the Soviet-Finnish War and the Russian Civil War, Elfvengren, together with Boris Savinkov, participated in the creation of the SZRS, the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom. As head of the Republic of Northern Ingria, Elfvengren undertook a successful attack on Petrograd together with the Finnish and German troops, and is also involved in the leadership of the underground organizations in Petrograd. In addition, Elfvengren was responsible in the Defense Union for organizing the struggle against the Bolsheviks near the borders with Finland. \n\nDespite his close ties with Savinkov, many years passed and Savinkov has since founded a new political movement in Russia. However, as Elfvengren believes - all who support Savinkov should be welcomed in Karelia."
kar.65.a:0 "Organize an exile for all Savinkovists!"

kar.66.t:0 "Karelian NRPR Department"
kar.66.d:0 "Before the Karelian secession, the NRPR was not really represented in the region, which was predominantly a stronghold of Socialist-Revolutionaries. As Savinkov's ideas are based on some SR ones, the local population, especially among the peasants, is likely to willingly accept some of the NRPR reforms. Moreover, if we want to get closer to Savinkovists, we can allow them to set up an official NRPR department."
kar.66.a:0 "Karelian peasants will be glad."

kar.67.t:0 "Adopting some of NRPR Reforms"
kar.67.d:0 "Savinkov's NRPR has various reforms, planned for Russian people, but not of them are good for the Karelians. This is why Elfvengren decided that only some NRPR reforms should be adopted. We can officially ban all other parties, mainly the Sivistysseura, and build a one-party state. Moreover, we can nationalize all enterprises in the region, which are owned either by Russians or by Finns, and finally, we can legalize state terror against all enemies of the state."
kar.67.a:0 "One-party state would be enough."
kar.67.b:0 "We should also nationalize all enterprises!"
kar.67.c:0 "And begin terror against all socialists!"

kar.68.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Denounced Integration!"
kar.68.d:0 "The [FROM.GetLeader], dictator of [FROM.GetName], has officialy denounced any integration into Finland or even becoming our autonomy! While we have invested much into Karelia, now their leader has just devalued all our efforts!"
kar.68.a:0 "Isn't it unfair?"

kar.69.t:0 "Karjala or War?"
kar.69.d:0 "It seems that the Karelian leader, [FROM.GetLeader] has completely lost his mind, as today our government has received an ultimatum from here to hand over all territories of Finnish Karjala to his unrecognized state! We can agree to prevent further bloodshed, but who he think he is?!"
kar.69.a:0 "Karjala on Suomi!"
kar.69.b:0 "Let him have it..."

kar.70.t:0 "Finland Accepts!"
kar.70.d:0 "The Finnish government was forced to accept our terms and hand over Karjala."
kar.70.a:0 "A great victory for the Karelians!"

kar.71.t:0 "Finland Refused!"
kar.71.d:0 "The Finnish government has expectedly refused to accept our terms and now we should get ready for war."
kar.71.a:0 "We should get ready!"

kar.72.t:0 "King of Karelia?"
kar.72.d:0 "Due to the fact that our king was ousted from his palace in Finland, he firstly was in exile in Finland. However, due to the Jägers being the last stronghold of true Finland, it was decided that the legitimate King of Finland and Karelia should settle in Karelia and reclaim his kingdom. Some of the Jägers find this idea appealing. Moreover, the local population of Karelians should now that their King is with them."
kar.72.a:0 "That's too dangerous for our king."
kar.72.b:0 "Proclaim the Karelian monarchy!"

kar.73.t:0 "Where Mythology Ends..."
kar.73.d:0 "The leader of the Forest Guerrillas, the so-called Ukki Väinämöinen, the real name of whom is Vaseli Levonen, has gone completely crazy. Believing in the unconditional support of the Karelian population, he, of course, misled himself and the Metsäsissit. In fact, a 80-year old man is already not capable of managing anything. The 'Loony Grandpa', as he is mockingly called by the Karelians, should leave the political scene. With the special act, issued by Elias Simojoki, the Metsäsissit were subordinated directly to the AKS, and Ukki Väinämöinen was arrested. It is hardly anyone will really remember him..."
kar.73.a:0 "The AKS consolidates its rule."

kar.74.t:0 "Land Reform!"
kar.74.d:0 "With Karelia finally liberated from the socialist infection, it is high time we start a fair land reform. The government of Karelia is to hand over half of the fields and a quarter of the forests to farmers, a quarter of the fields and forests to the local authorities, leaving a quarter of the farmland and half of the forests under the control of the state of Karelia."
kar.74.a:0 "A necessary step."

kar.75.t:0 "Socialization of Land!"
kar.75.d:0 "Despite the long rule of SR deputies in Karelia, it has never been fully socialized in term of land question. The conservative population, local Finnish and Russian landlords were against any significant land reforms in the area. With the fire of revolution spreading to Karelia, it is time for us to liberate the Karelian peasants and grant them land. The SR principle of land socialization should be fulfilled by the Karelian nation as well!"
kar.75.a:0 "For Soviet Karelia!"

kar.76.t:0 "The All-Karelian Assembly"
kar.76.d:0 "With the Metsäsissit now controlling the lands of Karelia, Ukki Väinämöinen has convened the All-Karelian Assembly, where he invited not policians, but common Karelians - one person from one village and the community elders. With about 50 people gathered, he started to talk that the final liberation is still not achieved. While he has mentioned the valuable help of the Finns, the people of Karelia are still in struggle, especially the common people - peasants and poor farmers. The necessary step to overcome the crisis, as Väinämöinen believes, is rather simple - a strong military, self-determination and a strong leader.\n\nThe issue of the strong leader, perhaps, was the most important one, but at the end of the Assembly, the delegates unanimously decided that in all of Karelia there was only one person capable of leading it - Ukki Väinämöinen."
kar.76.a:0 "He was the only candidate, wasn't he?"

kar.77.t:0 "Ending the Tribal Wars"
kar.77.d:0 "The Finnish tried to initiate several uprisings during the Russian Civil War and some of them were successful. However, with the recent war they have overstepped the mark. Despite the wishes of the Karelian people, they have tried to sabotage our rear and initiate a civil war between 'tribes' - various isolated villages for power. That as well happened in the Soviet-controlled villages as well, with local leaders fighting for power among small villages in order to be elected to the Labour Commune's Council. With the war with Finland finally over it is time for us to end this stupid 'wars'. With the help of the Red Guard we quickly managed to suppress all rebellions between the local Soviets and all separatist sentiments in the countryside."
kar.77.a:0 "We are a modern, secular state, after all!"

kar.78.t:0 "Ideological Family Separation"
kar.78.d:0 "The war has divided many, and it is especially terrible when war divides family and friends. Such was the case with the family of our faithful General Iivo Ahava. His father, the famous merchant and nationalist Paavo Ahava, leader of the Sivistysseura, found himself on the other side of the barricades. So did his younger brother, also a military general. Unfortunately, the Ahava family was divided over the issue of Karelian identity. While Iivo advocated the independence of Karelia, which is also advocated by the Soviet authorities, his father and brother believe that Karelia should have been annexed to Finland.\n\nOn learning of this story, the leadership of the Workers' Commune expressed its condolences to our loyal general, but reminded him that he was really fighting for the people's power, unlike his relatives."
kar.78.a:0 "That's sad."

kar.79.t:0 "Our Johtaja!"
kar.79.d:0 "Our dear leader, Ukki Väinämöinen, today has been officially declared the 'Johtaja' of Karelia, or the Vozhd/Supreme Leader of Karelia. That is a great decision of the All-Karelian Assembly. Thanks to our loyal patriots, our nation will be now ruled by a strong leader with a rich battlefield and partisan experience. Under his leadership all of Karelia shall be united!"
kar.79.a:0 "Great!"

kar.80.t:0 "The Death of Fredrik Kaarle I"
kar.80.d:0 "Our beloved king, Fredrik Kaarle I of Karelia, has passed away as a result of an infection on a wound from the first Weltkrieg at age 72, leaving the Karelian throne vacant. In his place his second eldest surviving son prince Wolfgang shall rise to the throne, taking on the regnal name Väinö I at his coronation [ROOT.Capital.GetName], where the Finnish crown will for the first time be worn by someone other than his father, as had been agreed upon in 1919 when he came along with his father as crown prince of Finland and Karelia in the stead of his elder brother prince Philipp, who remained in Germany."
kar.80.a:0 "The king is dead! Long live the king!"

kar.81.t:0 "Botanical Diversity of White Karelia"
kar.81.d:0 "The botanical diversity of White Karelia is truly cannot be imagined. Various isolated villages in the boreal forest landscapes are surrounded by beautiful plants and vegetation. With a clear aim to study all of them, a rector of Helsinki University, Kaarlo Linkola has arrived to our lands.\n\nA Finnish botanist and phytogeographer, Linkola, made a unique contribution to the understanding of regeneration in herbaceous plant communities in studying the natural occurence of seedlings in meadows and on cliffs. He also made a suite of investigations of root architecture together with his students. He is also well-known for being the co-founder of the Finnish Union for Nature Protection, which has now spread its influence to Karelia and is said to be influenced by the ideas of Bellamyism and Eco-Syndicalism."
kar.81.a:0 "Hope that Linkola will make interesting discoveries."

kar.82.t:0 "Finno-Ugric Liberation"
kar.82.d:0 "Despite the Karelians and Finns have secured their independence from the Russian Bear and his claws, many of our kin brothers are still under colonization and oppression of the Bear. The Finno-Ugric nations are under great threat of extinction. As our Johtaja has states - only liberation of these nations can bring them prosperity."
kar.82.a:0 "All Finno-Ugric nations should be free!"

kar.83.t:0 "Tver Karelia"
kar.83.d:0 "As a part of Russian colonialism consequences, the Tver Karelia appeared because of the mass resettlement of Karelians from their ancestral places on the Karelian Isthmus and Northern Ladoga to the vacant palace lands of Bezhetsky Verkh in the second half of the 16th - first quarter of the 18th centuries. Deprived of the ties with their tribesmen in Olonets and White Sea Karelia, Tver Karelians eventually separated into a separate subethnos of Karelians, speaking a special Tver dialect of the Karelian language.\n\nRefugees from the Korelsky uyezd Vodskaya Pyatina settled on state land in Tver, devastated by the troubles and oppression of the Russian Time of Troubles. According to the last census in Russia, there were 140567 Tver Karelians. This resettlement was carried out by the Moscow government in an orderly manner, the places intended for future settlements of Karelians were inspected in advance, which indicates the intentional deportation of Karelians by the Moscow tsardom.\n\nOur brothers in Tver shall be liberated from the Russian rule, but for now the programs of immigration to their rightful lands are organized."
kar.83.a:0 "Freedom for all Karelians!"

kar.84.t:0 "Tver Karelia"
kar.84.d:0 "Tver Karelia appeared as the result of mass resettlement of Karelians from their ancient places on Karelian Isthmus and Northern Ladoga to the barren lands of Bezhetsky Verkh in the second half of XVI - first quarter of XVIII centuries. Deprived of the contacts with their fellow tribesmen in Olonets and White Sea Karelia, Tver Karelians eventually split up into a separate subethnos of Karelians, speaking a special Tver dialect of the Karelian language.\n\nThe refugees from Korelsky uyezd of Vodskaya pyatina settled on the state lands in Tver devastated by the troubles and oppressions of the Russian Troubles. According to the last census there were 140567 Tver Karelians in Russia. This resettlement was carried out in an orderly manner by the Moscow government, the places intended for future settlements of Karelians were inspected in advance, which indicates the non-violent deportation of Karelians by the Moscow tsar.\n\nNow the nationalist government of the so-called "Karelian Republic" declared that Tver Karelia would be liberated and opened repatriation programs. We will not allow some separatists to do this! In this connection, the government of the Tver province proposes to establish a Karelian national district centered in Likhoslavl, the national-cultural autonomy of the Tver Karelians."
kar.84.a:0 "Establish the Karelian National District!"
kar.84.b:0 "We will not succumb to separatist innuendos!"

kar.85.t:0 "Peace with Karelia?"
kar.85.d:0 "With the Finno-Karelian nationalists seizing Petrozavodsk and dealing with socialist resistance, it is time to sue for peace on the Northern front, instead focusing on the our more serious neighbours."
kar.85.a:0 "We need a quite northern front now."
kar.85.b:0 "Never! We shall crush those separatists!"

kar.86.t:0 "Peace with Finland?"
kar.86.d:0 "With the Karelians capturing Finnish Karelia, we are now open to sending them an ultimatum to cede the territories and end the war. Whether the Finns will accept these terms is debatable."
kar.86.a:0 "Send them an ultimatum!"
kar.86.b:0 "We shall conquer all of Finland!"

kar.87.t:0 "Peace with Karelia?"
kar.87.d:0 "With the Karelians capturing Finnish Karelia, they have sent us an ultimatum. We must cede all their claims to them and sign a peace treaty."
kar.87.a:0 "Who they think they are?"
kar.87.b:0 "Peace is now the best option."

### Leader Desc ###
POLITICS_UKKI_VAINAMOINEN_DESC:0 "Born Vasiliy Leontievich Sidorov or Vaseli Levonen in 1855, Ukki Väinämöinen got his pseudonym during the glorious, yet sorrowful days of East Karelian Uprising. During the uprising he was elected as the leader of the Karelo-Finnish Forest Guerrillas, or Metsäsissit, and became very popular among the Karelians. His nickname \"Ukki Väinämöinen\", meaning 'Grandfather Väinämöinen' was given to him by common Karelian peasants from his resemblance to the hero Väinämöinen of Finnish mythology, as both had a short, stocky stature and a long beard.\n\nA zealous Christian and an anti-communist, Ukki Väinämöinen was rather successful in organizign the movement and by end of 1921, the Karelian rebels controlled a significant part of Northeast Karelia. Due to the German mediation, the uprising was soon to end. Karelia stayed under Russian power and Ukki Väinämöinen fled to Finland with his loyal Metsäsissit.\n\nHe lived in peace until the sun of freedom rose again over Karelia. Together with Yrjö Elfvengren he led his loyal Metsäsissit to fight the Russian loyalists and liberate Karelia once and for all."
POLITICS_YRJO_ELFVENGREN_DESC:0 "Perhaps, there is only one word that can describe Yrjö Elfvengren - opportunist. Born in Karelia in 1889 in a family of a Finnish colonel of the Russian Imperial Army, he followed his father's steps. In the Weltkrieg he successfully fought, conducting reconnaissance in the enemy's rear and was awarded the cross of the Order of St. George. After being wounded he was transferred to the military hospital near St. Peterburg, but he never returned to the frontline.\n\nAfter the murder of Grigory Rasputin, he was put in pretrial detention mainly because he was an acquaintance of Feliks Yusupov and Vladimir Purishkevich and he was suspected of planning the murder of Empiress Alexandra. He was released in March 1917 after the Februar Revolution removed Monarchy from Russia.\n\nDuring 1917 he became the vice-president of the Union of the Knights of the Cross of George, which purpose was to oppose Bolsheviks and at the same time keep Russia in the war alongside the Entente. On January 14, 1918, Elfvengren took part in attempted terrorist attack on Lenin. The attack failed and Elfvengren had to flee... and he soon found himself as the head of the Crimean Tatars fighting against the Soviet Power in the Crimea.\n\nHe led a number of successful attacks against Crimean Bolsheviks, but he got information about Finnish Civil War in the newspaper and returned to Finland to join the forces of the Finnish Senate under General Mannerheim. He commanded the 1st Karelian regiment and participated in the battles against Finnish RedGuards and Russian Bolsheviks. He greatly contributed to the White Guard victory in the Finnish Civil War, but his fight had not stopped.\n\nTogether with Boris Savinkov and Karlis Goppers he established SZRS - Union of the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom. He focused on anti-Bolshevist terrorist attack near the border of Finland. That eventually led to him becoming the commander of the North Ingermanlandian Regiment and leader of the Republic of North Ingria. He conquered the border zone and started an offensive on Petrograd, and contributed in Bolshevik defeat on the Northern Front.\n\nUnfortunately, he was never granted amnesty by the new White governemnt of Russia, because it considered him to be a separatist and did not recognize independence of Finland. Moreover, he was forced to resign from the chairmanship of North Ingria and stay in Finland.\n\nA lot of years have passed, but the opportunistic spirit never left Elfvengren. When he was informed about the second civil war in Russia, together with Metsäsissit he crossed the border into Karelia in order to lead the reborn republic."
POLITICS_PAAVO_AHAVA_DESC:0 "Paavo Ahava, a native of Uhtua, is a Karelian merchant and tribal activist who became one of the most significant figures in the national awakening of White Karelia. He moved to Finland as early as 1883 and by 1900 founded his own store in Kuusamo, where he quickly became the most successful merchant in the locality.\n\nAhave got excited about the Karelian tribalism already at the age of 13. He collected book donations from various publishers and with their support founded Uhtua's first library. During the first Russian revolution he was organizing national meetings in Uhtua. He also became the one who delivered White Karelia's great address to the Russian Imperial Duma. In 1906, together with Aleksei Mitro and Iivo Härkönen he established the Union of the White Sea Karelians - the national public organization of the Karelian population of Northern Karelia. The Union was banned by the Russian authorities and later changed its name to Sivistysseura - Karelian Enlightenment Society. During the Finnish Civil War in the spring of 1918, Ahava actively pushed for the annexation of Eastern Karelia to Finland and toured diligently propagandizing for the cause. After the civil war, Ahava was appointed as the head of the United Karelian government, established by the Finland.\n\nWith the Karelia once again on the world map, Paavo Ahava returned to his hometown of Uhtua together with other Sivistysseura members in order to help Karelians in their national-cultural awakening."
POLITICS_ANDREY_MATVEEV_DESC:0 "Andrey Matveev became famous as a teacher, the only Veps member of the Constituent Assembly, a cooperator and a Socialist-Revolutionary. After the start of the Russian Civil War, he left the politics, but rather soon the war ended and the Olonets governorate was in dire need of a leader. He participated in the elections to the local government and won. During the last 15 years he served as the Governor of the Olonets, promoting rather leftist agenda. With the Civil War raging on once again, this time Matveev has no other choice but to support the Left SRs. He was assigned as the leader of the Karelian Labour Commune - and now the Karelian and Veps population will no longer struggle without so much necessary Socialist-Revolutionary reforms."
POLITICS_ELIAS_SIMOJOKI_DESC:0 "As a youth Lauri Elias Simojoki saw service in the struggle for Finnish Independence and then with the Metsäsissit in East Karelia. He was the son of a clergyman and studied theology in the University of Helsinki, where he became involved in the formation of the Academic Karelia Society, serving as its chairman from 1922-23 and secretary from 1923-24. He advocated the union of all Finnish people into a Greater Finland. He was strongly influenced by Russophobia and he addressed a rally on 'Kalevala Day' in 1923 with the slogan \"In the name of Finland's lost honour and her coming greatness, death to the Ruskis!\"\n\nBecame involved in the Lapua Movement, he took command of their youth movement, Sinimustat. Now, as a leader of the AKS in East Karelia, he has risen to power in a coup, supported by the Forest Guerrillas to turn Karelia into a truly Finnish and radically anti-Russian province."

### Leaders ###
# Mahidol Line
POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC:0 "Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Supreme Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot." # Prajadhipok
POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Siamese people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king and that his reign would not last long." # Ananda Mahidol
POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC:0 "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the savior of the once embattled Siamese monarchy" # Bhumibol Adulyadej
# Paribatra Line
POLITICS_SUKHUMBHAND_DESC:0 "Paribatra Sukhumbhand, cousin to expected successor to the Siamese throne Ananda Mahidol, has seized control of the Siamese government, citing Ananda's inexperience and his age. With the full support of the Privy Council he has crowned himself as King Rama VIII, firmly establishing the Boripatr cadet branch as the new ruling house." # Paribatra Sukhumbhand
POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC:0 "Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX, has succeeded his father, Rama VIII, to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse, but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad." # Chumbhotbongs Paribatra
POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC:0 "Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand (Rama VIII) and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother King Rama IX due to the latter's inability to produce a male heir. He has ascended to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok's poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda's ascension much of the remaining public discontent with the monarchy has dissipated."
# Chrakrabongse Line
POLITICS_CHULA_CHAKRABONGSE_DESC:0 "Chula Chakrabongse, the half-Ukrainian grandson of King Rama V, has been installed as king of Siam. Chula Chakrabongse lived an eccentric life of leisure in Britain and later Austria before becoming king, and has delegated nearly all of his royal duties in favour of his passion for both horse and automobile racing."
# Left
POLITICS_SONG_NOPPAKUL_DESC:0 "Song Noppakul, also known by his real name Prasong Wongwiwat and 'Comrade Ba', is a Siamese-Chinese man who co-founded the underground Syndicalist movement within Siam. Following the death of Pichit na Sukothai he became its de-facto leader."# Song Noppakul the Totalist
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people upon his appointment as a minister. His controversial 'Yellow Cover Dossier' outlined his political and economic reform agenda and divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi's political career." # Pridi Phanomyong at the onset of the CW
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title Luang Praditmanutham, has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloodly Siamese Civil War. Panomyong's policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue, however challenges from more radical elements within Pridi's Sahachip Party have grown significantly. Despite his popularity, Panomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy." # Pridi Phanomyong after winning his rebellion
# Right
POLITICS_PLAEK_KHITTASANGKHA_DESC:0 "Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, more popularly known as 'Chormpon Por' by thelocals and 'Phibun' in the West, the one-time ally of Pridi Phanmoyong and the People's Party has seized power following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to sideline the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation." # Plaek Phibunsongkhram after Coup d’état
POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC:0 "Police Chief Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique. Phao is known for his brutality and political cunning, and his political opponents tend to 'disappear'. Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican" # Phao Sriyanond
POLITICS_SARIT_THANARAT_DESC:0 "General Sarit Thanarat has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Sisao Thawaet Clique. Originally a lowly officer in the Phayap Army, he quickly rose through the ranks with Plaek and Phin's help. An ardent anti-Syndicalist, he views the Monarchy as an important tool against the reds and as the focal point of Thai Nationalism." # Sarit Thanarat
# Republic
POLITICS_THAWAN_THAMRONGNAWASAWAT_DESC:0 "Nicknamed the 'Golden-Tongue Statesman', Thawan is renowned for his public speaking and debating skills, which he fully exploit for his coalition building. As a champion of the grassroots, the ex-Admiral favours policies which helps the common people, such as price ceiling for household commodities and expansion of public welfare. However, these policies also put him at odds with the capitalists and the burgeoning Thai-Chinese middle class who are burdened with greater taxes."
POLITICS_POTE_SARASIN_DESC:0 "A Thai-Chinese from upper middle class background, Pote Sarasin's experience in the Ministry of Finance during the Black Monday has shaped his worldview. As fan of the Austrian economist Hayek and a strict adherance to the law, he is against the expansion of state-owned enterprises while trying to ensures the fair, free and open competition. Another policy of his being the expansion of higher education across the nation as a mean to reinvigorate the recovering local industries."
POLITICS_KUEKRIT_PRAMOJ_DESC:0 "As a member of a cadet branch of the Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry, Kuekrit may appears as an odd choice of leader for republican Siamese state. Inspite of that, this 'Young Viper' manages to gather enough political clout among the many conservative circles with his own political shrewdness rather than his familial connection to gain a working majority for the new government to function properly. His policy of 'Ngoen Phan'(Money Fluctuation) help keeps the rural area happy and secured from the Syndicalist hands. Whether if he only pay lip services to the republican causes, however, remain to be seen..."

siam.15.d:0 "King Ananda Mahidol of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VIII—the 8th monarch of the House of Chakri—was found in his bed, shot dead.

## Introduction Events ##
siamn.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] in 1936"
siamn.1.d:0 "One of the countries that benefited from German victory during the Weltkrieg, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the western imperialists. While [SIA.GetSIAshortname]'s relationship with the Huns is, in general, cordial, the fact that they thwarted her expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. If [SIA.GetSIAshortname] should reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others powers is a matter to be decided in the coming decade."
siamn.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
siamn.1.b:0 "I've a good grasp of the general situation."

siamn.2.t:0 "The State of Politics"
siamn.2.d:0 "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth within [SIA.GetSIAshortname] have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Supreme Council of State). This is a council made up of the King's older siblings, who have continually worked to consolidate their power while keeping the power of the king over the nation weak. Despite promising the [SIA.GetAdjective] intelligentsia that a codified constitution would be issued any reform has been tough to pass, as it would be against the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the Konbaung dynasty to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or through the use of force."
siamn.2.a:0 "I pity the poor king..."

siamn.3.t:0 "The Kingdom's Many Other Problems"
siamn.3.d:0 "While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to outside eyes, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and must cherish the economic ties it shares with the nation. Industry is a very fragile and small section of the economy, which is mainly built around rice, sugar, and timber exports. Nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising, which raises the spectre of separatist movements in the near future. On top of all this: the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes and thus allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]."
siamn.3.a:0 "I'd rather pick the Philippines."

## Black Monday and Early political chaos # Max Reform 7 - Lowest 0: 0-2 = Khana Ratsadon coup, 3-4 = Civil War with Prajadhipok Bias (based on Boworadet Rebellion), 5-6 = success, 7 = Reactionary coup with Paribatra as HoS
siamn.4.t:0 "Black Monday hits [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"
siamn.4.d:0 "Due to its heavy reliance on its economic ties with Germany Black Monday has quickly dragged [SIA.GetSIAshortname] into an economic abyss as demand for her main agricultural exports has fallen sharply and shipments have been left to wither in their warehouses. Clerks working for foreign companies are continually being laid off, while the people have begun to gather around the Grand Palace looking for hope. It is apparent that we must do something about our economic situation lest it worsen and send us spiraling further down."
siamn.4.a:0 "Khun Prah!"

siamn.5.t:0 "Jasmine Rice Problems"
siamn.5.d:0 "One of the largest exporters of rice within [SIA.GetSIAshortname], the farmers across the Chao Phraya, have asked for government intervention to deal with the excessive supply of rice due to a general fall in demand and fewer export opportunities after Black Monday."

siamn.5.c:0 "The free market shall resolve the issue!" #0, 0 reform

siamn.6.t:0 "Bloated Bureaucracy"
siamn.6.d:0 "The modern bureaucratic system was formed during the reign of Rama V and had been greatly expanded by Rama VI. However, it has proved to be too large to effectively serve the state. Firing more people, however, would mean an increase in the unemployment rate at exactly the time when we want it to drop."
siamn.6.a:0 "Lay off a few of our clerks." # 0 reform
siamn.6.b:0 "Lay off managers and ministers." #-100, +1 reform
siamn.6.c:0 "Allow the status-quo for now." #-200, +2 reform

siamn.7.t:0 "Military Expenditure"
siamn.7.d:0 "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] currently spends up to 25% of her annual revenue on the preservation and maintenance of the military-industrial complex, as she is surrounded by both historical enemies and imperialistic westerners who desire her land. However perhaps slightly cutting our military expenditures wouldn't hurt us too much?"

siamn.8.t:0 "Emergency Tax"
siamn.8.d:0 "Even though we've enacted many sweeping reforms we still do not have enough money to sufficiently balance this year's budget. An emergency tax should help remedy this situation, but will create more suffering for our loyal subjects."
siamn.8.a:0 "Increase the income tax rate!" #+50, 0 reform

## New Governmnet Established for Siam ##
siamn.10.t:0 "The Khana Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
siamn.10.d:0 "Following the bloodless revolution we must rebuild the nation from the ground up. Luang Praditmanutham, head of the civilian faction of the provisional government and a prominent leftist, is now working on the creation of a formal constitution while others are beginning to educate the masses about the merits and workings of parliamentary democracy. Alongside all of this Phraya Phahonponpayuhasena has readied his troops, in case of an opportunistic invasion by foreign powers."
siamn.10.a:0 "This is a great leap forward for [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"

siamn.11.t:0 "The Khanagummakarn Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
siamn.11.d:0 "Following the ratification of the constitution the People's Committee, a group chosen by Prajadhipok himself, has begun the education of the masses in the ways of proper parliamentary democracy.\n\nHeaded by the [SIA.GetAdjective] Court, the Committee is also responsible for educational, health, and industrialisation reforms. The path ahead for [SIA.GetSIAshortname] will hardly be a stroll in the park but a bright future does await our great nation."

siamn.13.d:0 "King Prajadhipok's reply has arrived and is heavily critical of Luang Praditmanutham's draft, going so far as to accuse Praditmanutham of being a syndicalist! An emergency session of the chief members of the People's Party has lead to the party deciding to..."

siamn.14.t:0 "Domestic Tensions"
siamn.14.d:0 "Thawan Ritthidet, a private citizen, has recently filed a lawsuit against the King; accusing him of intervention in political, state, and economic affairs.

siamn.67.d:0 "Siam's civil war, started by the release of the yellow cover dossier and the subsequent arrest of Pridi Phanomyong, has thrown the country into upheaval. As the smoke clears and the dust settles, the broken relics of the previous order give way to a new period of uncertainty and possibility. Following the fight, the leaders of the victorious groups convene in Bangkok for the Congress of Siam, a significant meeting that will define the nation's future trajectory. The delegates gather in the ancient halls of authority, surrounded by echoes of history, to discuss and decide Siam's fate. As debates progress and tempers boil, the voices of the people rise up, demanding justice, equality, and freedom. Cries for change are becoming louder from all throughout the country, from bustling cities to peaceful countryside, resonating across the land like a clarion call for reform. As the Congress progresses, alliances form, concessions are negotiated, and decisions are taken that will influence Siam's destiny for future generations. The delegates wrestle with the weight of history, seeking a way forward that acknowledges the sacrifices of the past while setting a pathway for a better future. In the furnace of debate and deliberation, the soul of the nation hangs in the balance, poised on the verge of transformation.\n\nAmidst the tumultuous aftermath of Siam's civil strife, three formidable leaders emerge, each bearing the standard of a distinct political ideology and commanding a party with its own vision for the nation's future. As the Congress of Siam gathers to chart the course of post-war recovery, the divergent paths laid out by these candidates and their parties become the turning point upon which Siam's destiny teeters:\n\nPridi Phanomyong, an eminent statesman and revered architect of modern Thai politics, leads the Labour Party with unyielding conviction and a vision of Moderate Socialism. Emerging from the crucible of intellectual discourse and progressive thought, Phanomyong embodies the spirit of reform and renewal. His towering intellect and pragmatic approach to governance have endeared him to a broad spectrum of Thai society, from the urban intelligentsia to the rural peasantry. Rooted in the principles of economic equity, social welfare, and democratic governance, Phanomyong's vision for Siam is one of inclusive prosperity and social harmony. Under his enlightened leadership, the Labour Party aspires to bridge the gaping chasm that divides the ruling elite from the toiling masses, forging a new social contract that promises equal opportunity, social justice, and participatory democracy for all.\n\nSupha Sirimanont, a luminary of the labor movements and revered intellectual, strides forth as the indomitable leader of the Syndicalist Party of Siam. Born from the crucible of grassroots activism and proletarian struggle, Sirimanont stands as an unwavering champion of workers' rights and social justice. His charismatic presence and impassioned rhetoric resonate deeply with the downtrodden masses, igniting flames of hope and revolutionary fervor. Grounded in the principles of Centralized Syndicalism, Sirimanont's vision for Siam is one of centralized power, where industrial unions wield authority over the means of production, and where the working class emerges as the true architects of their destiny. Under his stewardship, the Syndicalist Party seeks to dismantle the entrenched hierarchies of privilege and oppression, forging a new social order founded upon principles of solidarity, equality, and collective empowerment.\n\nSong Noppakhun, a visionary strategist and fervent disciple of revolutionary ideology, stands at the vanguard of the Communist Party of Siam. Inspired by the teachings of Marx and Lenin, Noppakhun envisions a Siam where the proletariat rise triumphant, casting off the chains of capitalist oppression and ushering in a new era of collective liberation. His formidable intellect and unwavering commitment to the cause of proletarian emancipation have galvanized legions of followers to his banner, sparking flames of revolution that threaten to consume the old order. Rooted in the principles of scientific socialism, Noppakhun's vision for Siam is one of radical transformation, where the dictatorship of the proletariat reigns supreme, and where the bourgeois oppressors are consigned to the dustbin of history. Under his resolute leadership, the Communist Party vows to centralize power in the hands of the state, implementing sweeping reforms to reshape the fabric of Thai society and establish a socialist utopia founded upon principles of collective ownership, social equality, and revolutionary solidarity.\n\nAs the Congress of Siam convenes to chart the course of post-war recovery and reconstruction, the fate of the nation hangs in the balance. These three titans of Thai politics, each bearing the hopes and aspirations of their followers, present divergent paths forward. Their ideologies clash, their visions compete, and the future of Siam hangs in the balance, poised on the precipice of history."

SIA_juridicialreform:0 "Judicial Reform"
SIA_juridicialreform_desc:0 "While the archaic Ayutthayan era laws are no longer in place we must regain the jurisdiction rights we lost after the ratification of the Bowring Treaty, in order to boost our prestige worldwide. By doing so, we will make our judicial system much more effective."
SIA_centralizedpolicecommand:0 "Centralised Police Command"
SIA_centralizedpolicecommand_desc:0 "Following the Weltkrieg our police command has become paralysed as it is comprised of a mix of German, Italian, and American employees.

SIA_chiangmaioil_desc:0 "Crude oil was first discovered in the Fang district, specifically Chiang Mai, in 1921 but was never properly exploited. The current economic crisis has driven up the price to record levels and any instability in the region might cut us off from our imported sources in Palembang. Becoming more self-reliant may well help improve our struggling industrialisation as well."

### Agricultural Path ###
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation_desc:0 "Rice paddy uses over half of the arable land in [SIA.GetName], yet it consists mainly of peasants farming small areas and producing modest amounts of rice. By providing cheap, low-interest loans for the purchase of tractors and modern equipment we can free some of these farmers from the ricefields and send them to the factories instead, without compromising crop yields."
SIA_agrarianscoop:0 "Agricultural Co-operatives"
SIA_agrarianscoop_desc:0 "While the first [SIA.GetAdjective] co-op was created back in 1916, co-ops themselves aren't a common sight among rural communities yet. By persuading rice farmers to pool their savings together and organize into co-ops they will have enough money to buy the badly needed farming equipment in these hard times, and obtain greater bargaining power against the rice merchants."
SIA_communalapproach:0 "A Communal Approach"
SIA_communalapproach_desc:0 "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. Our farmers have long resisted to government intervention and embraced egalitarian methods, exchanging labour with other farmers to cover their needs. By focusing on these aspects of [SIA.GetAdjective] society and encouraging further community cooperation we can build a better country, while guarding against aristocrats and landlords."
SIA_newfarmingtheory:0 "Model Farm Initiative"
SIA_newfarmingtheory_desc:0 "By creating 'Model Farms' throughout the country, where rice farmers can study new farming techniques and crop diversification, farmers can improve how they utilize their lands and thus greatly increase output."
SIA_selfsufficiencyeconomics:0 "Economic Self-Sufficiency"
SIA_selfsufficiencyeconomics_desc:0 "Our plans to boost rice cultivation have worked incredibly well so far, and a dizzying amount agricultural surplus is available. We can now fully focus on our industrialisation plan."
SIA_exportrice:0 "Export-Oriented Rice Production"
SIA_exportrice_desc:0 "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. Rice production normally does not ammount to much more than the farmer needs to survive, leaving very little to profit from. If necessary we can colaborate with large rice merchants and mills to supply a market pressure for more production, or we can simply obligate the farmers to produce more by increasing their rice tax."
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme:0 "Rice Subsidy Scheme"
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme_desc:0 "By creating incentives for those farmers who have accomplished huge increases in their rice output and allowing peasants to own the land they've cleared for agricultural purposes we can provide simple market incentives to cultivate more land and increase crop yields."

SIA_royalsiamesearmy_desc:0 "First formed in 1874, as a response to new security threats brought in by the 1855 Bowing treaty (which opened us to international trade) - the army is the oldest and largest branch in the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Armed Forces, fulfilling its role as the protector of our sovereignty."
SIA_phibunsongkhramplan:0 "Phibunsongkhram's Reforms"
SIA_phibunsongkhramplan_desc:0 "The [SIA.GetName] will adopt a doctrine based on the advice of Luang Phibunsongkhram.

SIA_seriroengritplan:0 "Seriroengrit's Reforms"
SIA_seriroengritplan_desc:0 "The [SIA.GetName] will follow the advice of Luang Seriroengrit, the leader of the Phayap Army who fought off numerous cross-border raids from Burma post-British Revolution.

SIA_phrayaphahonplan:0 "Phahonphonphayuhasena's Plan"
SIA_phrayaphahonplan_desc:0 "The [SIA.GetName] will adopt the proposals of Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena. Studies at the Hauptkadettenanstalt during his younger years and experience of the German General Staff's work during the Weltkrieg have convinced him that proper planning is the key to victoy."

SIA_femalecorps_desc:0 "While 'Ja-Khlone', female palace guards, have been a common sight in the inner palace since the Ayutthayan era having female soldiers in active combat is on another level altogether. Luang Phibunsongkhram himself has voiced limited support for the petition, but the question is still up in the air. Persuing such measures is sure to anger traditionalists."
SIA_asymmetricalwarfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
SIA_asymmetricalwarfare_desc:0 "By analyzing the tactics employed by the Vietnamese in the Saigon Uprising -which quickly became the Indochinese Rebellion- and some of Luang Chumnanyutthasart's exploits in Shan back in 1928, we can gain some insight into effective placement of troops and how to fight in urban terrain."

SIA_armyaffairs:0 "Army Reorganisation"
SIA_armyaffairs_desc:0 "Our army currently uses various rifle and artillery models, which has proved to be a logistical nightmare.

SIA_royalmiltaryacademy:0 "Chulachomklao [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy"
SIA_royalmiltaryacademy_desc:0 "By merging the Royal Military Academy (est. 1887) with the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Army Polytechniques Institute, the newly-named Chulachomklao [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Military Academy should get better results as their funding will be streamlined and more efficient."
SIA_royalmunitionsfactory:0 "[SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] Munitions Factory"
SIA_royalmunitionsfactory_desc:0 "Having enemies on all sides, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] nearly used up all her artillery shells during the Weltkrieg, with no means of being freshly supplied.

SIA_industrialmobilization:0 "Industrial Mobilisation Plan"

SIA_expandmarinescorps_desc:0 "Although 'Taharn Ma-Rine' were first founded back in 1833, the unit served mostly as a royal honour guard throughout the 19th century. It wasn't until 1913 that the [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Marine Corps were reorganized into the modern "Navy Amphibious Assault Group" who saw some action back in the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the marines can serve as yet another ace in the hole for the upcoming conflict?"
SIA_improvedlandingcraft:0 "Improved Landing Craft"
SIA_improvedlandingcraft_desc:0 "The [SIA.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetAdjective] Marine Corps currently use ex-British merchant ships we seized back in the Weltkreig as their only mean of transportation.

SIA_newflagship:0 "A New Flagship"

SIA_coastaldefenseships:0 "Coastal Defence Ships"
SIA_coastaldefenseships_desc:0 "While these heavily armed cruisers are no match against German East Asiaflotte or Imperial Japanese Navy, and have limited capability in the high seas, they will surely serve our cash-strapped navy well, especially in the island-dotted coastal waters of both the Gulf of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] and the Andaman Sea."
SIA_riverpatolunit:0 "River Patrol Units"

While we have procurred four small submarines for the first line of defence; continuing the second phase of the plan, which entails another 5 submarines for the outer defensive line, might be a good idea."
SIA_twooceannavy:0 "A Two-Ocean Navy"

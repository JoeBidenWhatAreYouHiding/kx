### Parties ###
USA_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
USA_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (Vanguardist) - In addition to its mainstream syndicalist wing, the SPA also has a wing containing various authoritarian-leaning syndicalists, marxists, and more. These so-called "Vanguardists" are a small but vocal minority within the party, and the party's detractors often point to them as a cause for alarm. However, this does a disservice to the faction's diversity. William Foster, identifying as a syndicalist but espousing quite authoritarian views, advocates for a social revolution as well as collectivization, and is generally seen as the most radical member of the SPA. Recently, he has even gone so far as to call more moderate members of his party "reactionaries". Earl Browder, once a close friend of Foster, has since distanced himself from syndicalism somewhat, supporting the retention of many old American institutions such as small businesses, while also being somewhat socially conservative. Known as a negotiator, his focus is on industry and the economy, and this may win him support from other SPA factions. Lesser-known James Burnham advocates a technocratic society, in which a new managerial class will inevitably rise to replace the old aristocratic classes. He represents the most conservative Vanguardists as well as various breakaways from other factions of the SPA."
USA_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
USA_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (IWW) - The Industrial Workers of the World was founded in 1905 in Chicago, Illinois. Its main founders were Eugene Debs, Bill Haywood, Mary Harris "Mother" Jones, and Daniel De Leon, among others. Their motto "an injury to one is an injury to all" can be seen as representative of their greater party goals, which are first and foremost advocation for greater worker's rights and a new union-oriented economy. Today, the IWW is one of the most important groups within the SPA, and some would argue that it makes up its mainstream, for this wing of the party is currently the most popular. This could easily change, however. Of course, within such a faction, there are sure to be disagreements. Those who adhere to the IWW message generally identify themselves as syndicalists or anarcho-syndicalists, though they have different visions for how they would run the country. Bill Haywood has united this faction for now, with hopes to bring radical changes to the United States. As a result of this and the recent strife in the country, the SPA has exploded in popularity. Their main base of support is in the Steel Belt, which is now popularly called the Red Belt for the popularity of the SPA in the region. Due to his broad support in this area and the relative disunity of other regions, some even theorize that Haywood could win it all in the coming election."
USA_radical_socialist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
USA_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (Independent) - There are many leftists within the SPA who do not explicitly identify as syndicalists and have more moderate tendencies. This wing of the party is popularly called the "Nationalist" wing or the "Social Patriots". It traces some of its beliefs to author Edward Bellamy as well as old Nationalist Clubs. They are based more in social organizations than they are in unions, and this probably reflects their support among the middle-class rather than urban workers. The American Independence League is the strongest of these organizations, and with the other factions, they have differed from the syndicalists in their support for middle-class guilds, values of humanism, and a generally utopian vision for how American should be run. Norman Thomas is their main leader, inspired by the writings of Bellamy, though he is not alone in this faction of course. Overall though, their distinctiveness from other factions of the SPA makes them notable enough to be considered their own, and in some time, perhaps they will come to prominence within the party as a whole."
USA_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
USA_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party -  Progressives in America have a long and proud history. For all their efforts though, they have little to show for it on the national stage. Theodore Roosevelt is pointed to as a main Progressive figure, yet his bid for the presidency in the Bull Moose Party was ultimately unsuccessful. Other Progressives have tried and failed to win the presidency in recent decades, most notably Wisconsin Progresive Robert M. La Folelette. Now, with the country at its breaking point, they may finally have a shot. George Norris, popularly known as the "Fighting Liberal", is quite powerful within the Progressive Party. His support of a "Fair Deal" in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt's old idea, as well as his populist appeals to farmers, have made him the likely nominee for the party in the coming election. While they represent a platform that is distasteful to most elites, some are beginning to wonder if they would be preferable to the extremists that plague the country, and see them as a party that could address the concerns of most voters while also keeping the peace."
USA_social_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
USA_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party (Liberal) - The Republican Party has experienced significant success since its inception in the days of Abraham Lincoln. The recent presidency of Woodrow Wilson has perhaps put a dent in this success, but the Republican Party still stands strong. However, the events of the past few years have endangered the continue dominance of the Republican Party, and although sitting President Herbert Hoover is himself a Republican, there is no guarantee the party will win the upcoming election. In fact, the party is somewhat split between different wings, particularly on the issue of trade: the more protectionist wing, represented by Hoover and his vice president, Charles Curtis, and the more socially focused and free-trade minded liberal wing, represented by rising star Alf Landon. Both sides believe in a stimulus program to get the country back on its feet, although notably, Curtis is more focused on this in his speeches, whereas Landon points to tariffs as the main culprit behind the economic crisis. Landon is in a tough spot: he has found it difficult to criticize the incumbent party, since it is his party, and any critique of them could turn into a critique of him. The best he can do now is try to defeat Curtis and move forward at the head of a revitalized Republican Party. Even if he succeeds however, he has daunting four years ahead of him..."
USA_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
USA_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party (Conservatives) - The Republican Party has experienced significant success since its inception in the days of Abraham Lincoln. The recent presidency of Woodrow Wilson has perhaps put a dent in this success, but the Republican Party still stands strong. However, the events of the past few years have endangered the continue dominance of the Republican Party, and although sitting President Herbert Hoover is himself a Republican, there is no guarantee the party will win the upcoming election. In fact, the party is somewhat split between different wings, particularly on the issue of trade: the more protectionist wing, represented by Hoover and his vice president, Charles Curtis, and the more socially focused and free-trade minded liberal wing, represented by rising star Alf Landon. Both sides believe in a stimulus program to get the country back on its feet, although notably, Curtis is more focused on this in his speeches, whereas Landon points to tariffs as the main culprit behind the economic crisis. Curtis is well known and quite popular within insider circles, and his position as Hoover's vice president has won him more friends than one might expect. However, Hoover's record has put a bit of a splotch on Curtis's record, and he will have to work hard to shrug off a challenge to his left from Alf Landon in the party primary. If he can accomplish this though, his advisors are confident his hopeful message will beat the doom-and-gloom of Garner and the extremists that threaten to sap support from both major parties. But, Curtis himself wonders if he can accomplish a recovery where Hoover could not, and it is yet to be seen how he will differ in a significant way from his friend. Whispers of a new government intervenionism just around the corner have aroused anxiety in his advisors, yet his supporters have welcomed the rumors with significant enthusiasm, and perhaps this will be his path to victory."
USA_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
USA_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party is old, yet Hoover's time in office has reinvigorated the party. Prominent Democrats see the current crisis as the perfect opportunity to regain the White House, yet they are not free from challenges. For all their faults, the Republican Party has remained a unified force in electoral politics. Meanwhile, an offshoot branch of the Democratic Party, led by "Alfala Bill" Murray, threatens to tear the Democratic Party in half. Their base in the South could all but cripple the Democrats in the popular vote, if not the electoral college as well. Worse, the Democrats have also suffered in traditionally friendly urban areas, like New York City, which have gone over to the Socialist Party of America. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner is not in the mood for negotiation. His platform is focused on decrying socialist radicals in the North, immigrants in the cities, and minorities in the South. The interventionist proposals of Curtis and Landon are anathema to Garner; he believes they would give too much ground to socialists and populists, as he says Hoover has in his time in office. He has deemed austerity the only solution to the nation's economic woes, noting that if the country tightened its belts, perhaps it could finally function. If he wants to win though, Garner will have to expand his base beyond its traditional supporters, or perhaps win back disaffected supporters who left with Murray. This will be no easy task, and Garner certainly has a hard task ahead of him. But, if he wins, Garner is confident that his hardline strategy towards extremists will ultimately save the country. His fellow house members hope he is right, for if he fails, the country will surely fall apart. For now, all eyes are on Garner."
USA_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
USA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The America First Party is a new phenomenon in American politics, but in its short existence, it has managed to explode onto the political scene like a bomb. Louisiana Governor and now Senator Huey Long, known as the "Kingfish", has solidifed control over his state, and now has plans to run for president. He has sharply criticized President Hoover's attempts to ameliorate the crisis, instead advocating his own program of "Share Our Wealth". This program would limit personal net worth and yearly income, give old-age pensions to those over sixty years of age, work to guarantee free education for all, and redistribute wealth from the one percent to the rest of the population through taxes to pay for it. Long has already become a star in American political circles, and his speeches draw thousands of onlookers from Los Angeles to New York City. His greatest support has come in the Great Plains, the birthplace of Populism. Farmers and workers alike in this region, dealing with the brunt of the Dust Bowl crisis, have flocked to Long. However, his support is not limited to these states, and Long has enough support to potentially even win the upcoming election, assuming his anti-establishment message can sap enough support from the major parties and new party challengers. Should Long be elected though, he will face significant challenges. For one, opposition from the establishment would be rather strong, and Hoover has barely even acknowledged the AFP's existence. Further, should Long win, it is almost certain the result would be denounced as illegitimate by other parties, and this could cause conflict. Whatever happens though, the Kingfish and his AFP are ready, and anyone who underestimates them would be making a grave mistake."
USA_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Old Democratic Party"
USA_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party - During the Red Scare in President Woodrow Wilson's administration, syndicalists and other leftists were suppressed. However, the Republicans eased this pressure, and these groups have swelled in popularity once again. The Democrats, for their part, have done little to oppose this, and it seems that they are too weak, too corrupt, or both to deal with it. As such, former Oklahoma Governor "Alfalfa" Bill Murray has decided to lead anxious Dixiecrats to a new party, called the Old Democratic Party due to its espousal of older Democratic Party values. He has even decided to run for president with the motto of fighting "Communists, Corporations and Miscegenation". Murray's fiery speeches denouncing banks and political corruption have won him significant support in the South, but he has not accomplished this alone. The Ku Klux Klan, working in conjunction with the NDWL, has become a major force within the party, and have brought in more support than Murray had ever dreamed of. There are also the corporatist Fordists, who have given Murray a base outside the South as well, mainly among disaffected Democrats and Republicans in Northern cities. For now, these factions are unified under Murray's leadership, but if he wins the election, there is sure to be tension. These are the least of his worries though, as the ODP has even been ignored by some Southern congressmen, and they are rarely taken seriously on the national stage. Further, if the party can win in 1936, it is certain that there will be challenges to the ODP's leadership, and the situation might lead to armed conflict. Regardless, Murray is certain that the current system is failing, and he believes he is the only one who can save the country from itself.
USA_national_populist_party:0 "Old Democratic Party"
USA_national_populist_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party (National White League) - The National Democratic White League is one of the foremost factions of the Old Democratic Party. Their power emerged during the recent growth of Ku Klux Klan membership, and now they have millions of members across the country, ready to fight if need be. The NDWL generally supports an anti-syndicalist, anti-Black, and anti-Semitic platform that is more harsh in nature than the mainstream ODP platform. As such, they are often used to attack the ODP as far-right extremists, though this does not account for the diversity within the NDWL itself. The Young Klan is the newer of the two Klan factions, and it aims to modernize the organization, present itself as moderate and diplomatic, and appeal to groups the Klan failed to appeal to in the past. The Old Klan, modeled after the original Ku Klux Klan, has worked with the Black Legion and is generally seen as the more brutal of the two Klan factions, but also less aristocratic than its Young Klan counterpart. Meanwhile, Herbert Armstrong leads the fringes of the NDWL, under a unique movement of "Christian Identity". Armstrong draws significantly on the Bible and Christianity to justify the extreme positions he advocates, and he has his own vision for how America should be run."

USA_HOTB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States is in the midst of its worst political turbulence since 1865. Few expected this after America successfully avoided the Weltkrieg but the rise of syndicalism fomented a Red Scare and an economy depressed by nonstop worker strikes and political crackdowns. Herbert Hoover won the 1928 election promising a return to normalcy but with the Great Panic of 1928 occurring he has made no headway and his re-election via the House of Representatives has only damaged his legitimacy. Now US politics is challenged by numerous radical forces, all of whom promise in their own way an end to politics as we know it if elected."

### Ideas ###
USA_righteous_nation:0 "The Rightful President"
USA_righteous_nation_desc:0 "In light of the recent electoral deadlock, former President Herbert Hoover has given Douglas MacArthur his permission to succeed him as president of the United States and Commander in Chief. This was a painful decision for Hoover, but one that he felt needed to be done to end the crisis. Consequently, the new administration has gained legitimacy in the eyes of many of our citizens, and MacArthur is seen as the rightful winner of the election. With the support of most of Hoover's cabinet and Hoover himself, we are one step closer to bringing order to this fractured nation!"

USA_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
USA_great_depression_desc:0 "As a result of both constant political strife and the banking crash of 1929, the United States economy remains in turmoil."

USA_great_depression_2:0 "Great Depression Weakens"
USA_great_depression_2_desc:0 "The US economy is beginning to grow once again as unemployment rates lower but there is no doubt the economy is still depressed."

USA_great_depression_3:0 "Recovering Economy"
USA_great_depression_3_desc:0 "The US economy is beginning to grow once again as unemployment rates lower but there is no doubt the economy is still depressed."

USA_great_depression_4:0 "Near Economic Recovery"

USA_black_monday:0 "Black Monday"
USA_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

USA_black_monday2:0 "Black Monday"
USA_black_monday2_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

USA_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
USA_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America, the Populist AFP and the far-right ODP Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

USA_new_year_strike_idea:0 "New Year Strike"
USA_new_year_strike_idea_desc:0 "With the Unions' Candidate losing the 1936 election, a massive strike has been called for on New Years!"
USA_native_code_talkers_idea:0 "Native Code Talkers"
USA_native_code_talkers_idea_desc:0 "With the leaking of battleplans and other sensitive information making or breaking battles in this accursed war, we need a new source of encryption to make absolute sure that those damn Seperatists don't know of our plans! For this, we have turned to the Navajo people of Northern Arizona, with their incredibly complex language and small numbers, their language makes for the perfect one to encrypt our date!"

USA_fopc_idea:0 "Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution"
USA_fopc_idea_desc:0 "The FOPC has been established with the purpose of limiting extremist parties from ever taking hold in the country again.

USA_small_arms_industry_idea_desc:0 "The American Gun Industry is without a doubt the greatest in the world.

With the SPA continuing to skyrocket in membership over these past few decades, these strikes aren't going anywhere; and what's worse is that thanks to the power of the SPA, there's no hope of Busting. All we can do is sit and hope that they go back to work..."
USA_klan_activity_idea:0 "The Invisible Empire"
USA_klan_activity_idea_desc:0 "The Ku Klux Klan has ever since the civil war been a thorn in the Government's side. From it's humble beginnings as a simple terrorist organization, the Ku Klux Klan has in all but name become an institution in the South, with them used as yet another tool in Dixie's box. Normally the Northern Democrats have been able to make them heel outside of the South, but with the economy collapsed it seems that the Klan is no longer content to keep it's Southern Way of Life in the South.

USA_rural_investments_desc:0 "While generally opposed to high-levels of government intervention in the economy, supporting the rural economy is a no-brainer. The government will purchase goods from struggling farmers and grant state funding that will be used to support developing rural regions via the introduction or modernization of electricity."
USA_austerity:0 "Austerity Through the Storm"
USA_austerity_desc:0 "We have made the necessary investments to damage support for the radicals amongst the backbone of our democracy: the farmers and sharecroppers. However, now we must cut back on the budget and show businesses that this is a fiscally responsible nation they can invest in if we are to avoid both a debt that radicals can use against us and aid the economic recovery throughout the nation. But what to slash..."
USA_smash_radicals:0 "Smash Radicals"
USA_smash_radicals_desc:0 "We will not give into those who threaten to subvert American democracy for their own interests! MacArthur has offered to stomp them out if given the chance, and we will allow him to organize his military and gather intel for the mission. The only question is whom to focus on and how much so."
USA_undermine_old_democrats:0 "Undermine the Populists"
USA_undermine_old_democrats_desc:0 "We will not allow Populist factions to continue to undermine the Democratic Party! We will campaign throughout the regions where they are most popular, spread counter-propaganda, and promise tax cuts whenever possible. Of course we should decide which faction deserves our attention most, if not all of them."
USA_hoovers_boys:0 "The Director's Boys"
USA_hoovers_boys_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover is both the ruthless head of the recently formed Federal Bureau of Investigation and an invaluable asset against the militias and fanatics endangering liberty in the United States. He has offered numerous times to further investigate dangerous extremists if given the resources and direction."
USA_reassert_democrats:0 "Reassert the Democratic Party"
USA_reassert_democrats_desc:0 "The Democratic Party had suffered much from the rise of the numerous third parties attempting to steal its voterbase. However, the US can only be stable under a two-party system. We will use our re-established presence to bring old supporters back into the traditional Democratic mold, hopefully finishing off the AFP and Old Democrats from national importance."
USA_army_expansion:0 "MacArthur's Request"
USA_army_expansion_desc:0 "MacArthur seems to be effectively waging war against the radicals but has been desperately calling for additional aid, seemingly taking the governments lack of willingness to expand the military as a sign of weakness. Perhaps he does need some extra hands on deck, if he hopes to maintain order."
USA_finish_anarchists:0 "Finish Anarchism"
USA_finish_anarchists_desc:0 "The syndicalist cause has been greatly weakened and momentarily unable to raise a large enough militia to challenge the US army. Nonetheless, it remains a threat, as if a snake waiting for their chance to strike."
USA_yay_liquor:0 "A Blow for Liberty"
USA_yay_liquor_desc:0 "There have been increasingly loud calls for prohibition in recent years, and in fact, many states and smaller districts have enacted dry laws to damage the liquor business. However, the state needs funding and the right to alcohol is a fundamental freedom. Let us guide a reinvigorated Democratic Party towards wet laws that will make a mockery of the pro-prohibition authoritarians and bring in a new valuable source of income and business."
USA_sovereignity_of_legislature:0 "Sovereignty of the Legislature"
USA_sovereignity_of_legislature_desc:0 "Enough! America has been saved from the radicals and it is now time for Garner to set a precedent of divorcing the executive and legislative branches from one another. Many of the executive powers Wilson gave to the Presidency, including using government power to shape public opinion and investigating lawmakers, will be revoked. A hands off approach shall be taken to both Congress and the Democratic Party."
USA_the_republicans:0 "The Center Holds"

USA_new_republicans:0 "New Republicans"
USA_new_republicans_desc:0 "Capitalism obviously should be defended from those who would install more tyrannical and short-sighted systems but that does not mean the government could not be doing more than it is now to fight the depression. The New Republicans under Landon will help guide America with both free markets and help to those who need it most."
USA_home_rule_negotiations:0 "Home Rule Negotiations"
USA_home_rule_negotiations_desc:0 "America will not be saved with the iron fist but instead with that which has always served America best; freedom. If the people that make up the various radical sectors of America want to run their local governments differently so be it, but that does not mean they can leave America or violate the Constitution. Allow us to start the talks for a reasonable amount of autonomy."
USA_calm_the_storm:0 "Calm the Storm"
USA_calm_the_storm_desc:0 "We must reassure the nation that violent outbursts are not to be tolerated. We must direct the party to speak of the peace achieved and that only those practice their views through violence will be targeted by the federal government. In the meantime we can calm all sides by telling the military to move garrisons from border regions of radical territory as we were previously prepared for potential conflict."
USA_counter_klan:0 "Counter the Klan"
USA_counter_klan_desc:0 "The question of how to deal with the Klan is a complicated one. Much of Congress is in cahoots with the National Democratic White League, and they command enough power to cause major damage to the US if they desired. However, if we are to deal with it bloodlessly, we should embrace the more moderate members of the organization and encourage them to leave the Klan and NDWL in favor of smaller, more controllable groups. We won't get the hardliners to leave, but if we can sap most of their support, the effort will be a success."
USA_moderate_the_unions:0 "Reward Moderate Unions"
USA_moderate_the_unions_desc:0 "Destroying the Unions is an incredibly touchy subject, and one that rarely results in anyone winning. However, there is still a chance we can Bust the Unions and still come out on top, the SPA doesn't have a complete monopoly yet on Labor, there are still some, although small, Unions have have our sympathies, if we reward these Unions, and have them actively go against the radical ones, we just might be able to save America from the Syndicalist Terror, though that possibility looks more and more slim by the hour..."
USA_reassure_business:0 "Reassure Business"
USA_reassure_business_desc:0 "With the country seemingly ready to collapse at any day now, Big Business is more terrified then ever. We cannot let our great American businesses fail us, we must reassure them that we're going to fix this crisis and bring back America to the economic level she naturally should be at. Because after all, if confidence collapses, then the depression we're in will go on far longer, and the Radicals will grow even stronger."
USA_hunt_waste:0 "Hunt Waste"
USA_hunt_waste_desc:0 "In order to keep some semblace of Confidence in the Economy, we have to begin to institute austerity. It won't be all popular, but hopefully the new confidence will get Big Business investing again, and this crisis can finally end."
USA_return_to_normalcy:0 "A Return to Normalcy"
USA_return_to_normalcy_desc:0 "Against all odds, our plan has worked. Investment is steadily increasing, Strikes are becoming more and more rare, and the KKK have been pushed back into the South. The odds were against us, but we did it. We have returned to normalcy."
USA_curtis_in_charge:0 "The Old Guard"
USA_curtis_in_charge_desc:0 "While we are not Socialists, we agree that it's foolhardy to think that this crisis is going to suddenly evaporate just because we increased confidence. We knew that in 1789 we knew it in 1860, we knew it in 1896, and we know it now. Now, the government must do what it can to reward hard working Americans, just like we did in the past, whether that'd be unemployment or through tariffs."
USA_work_sharing_plan:0 "Work Sharing Plan"
USA_work_sharing_plan_desc:0 "One of the most ingenious ideas our economists have thought up, the Work Sharing Plan, might just be enough to save our nation. We compensate Americans for their hours lost via partial unemployment subsidies, and buisnesses to retrain them for when the crisis is over and they can get back to work! Thanks to to this ingenious idea, we can keep the amount spent to a minimum, and keep our populace happy!"
USA_new_tariffs:0 "New Tariffs"
USA_new_tariffs_desc:0 "The Republican Party has always been a protectionist party. Tariffs increase revenue for the Federal Government, protect our workers and employers from cheap foreign goods, and can be used as leverage in foreign policy. With the economy needing some new revenue for our Work Sharing Plan, tariffs serve as a natural policy, just as it did in our past economic crisises."
USA_good_times:0 "Good Times Are Just Around the Corner"
USA_good_times_desc:0 "Thanks to our careful balancing between intervention and free market, our economy is finally looking to be out of this crisis! It was hard, but thanks to our tried and true ways, America is finally back on her feet and set to make a full recovery! Good times will be coming round soon!"
USA_peace_through_trade:0 "Peace through Trade"
USA_peace_through_trade_desc:0 "While we have been protectionist in the past, it's time to let old policies go. Tariffs only serve to estrange our trade partners and further increase costs for the average American, as well as increase the already bloated power of the all encompassing Federal Government. Thus, by increasing cooperation with our allies, we can finally end the idiotic policy of Tariffs."
USA_landon_plan:0 "The Landon Plan"
USA_landon_plan_desc:0 "While we must stand firmly by capitalism, it is clear the economy is not going to recover on its own in short order without some government intervention. We should issue some investments and remove trade barriers to increase consumption and increase market confidence."
USA_i_will_not_promise:0 "I Will Not Promise the Moon"
USA_i_will_not_promise_desc:0 "We have gone far in recent days, freeing the economy from the shackles of the depression and providing goods for the people. But we must reassure the public, and investors, that we will not go too far, and balance the budget by cutting back when possible in our projects after negotiating with private sector leaders to take over. The economy shall grow and the US government will be seen as solvent and honest."
USA_unite_federal_americans:0 "Unite Federal Americans"
USA_unite_federal_americans_desc:0 "We have done it! We can now focus on chipping away at the support bases of the radicals more openly without political and economic stability fueling them. A propaganda and educational campaign will raise awareness of the federal government's recent actions, our national political identity and the threats posed by those who desire revolution."
USA_norris:0 "The Fighting Liberal"
USA_norris_desc:0 "Despite the odds, President Norris has been elected, and now serves as the 31st President of the USA. One of the few Progressives left in America, Norris has won on a platform of the Square Deal, saving the American Public from war, and finally living up to the goals of American Democracy. This is true for all Americans, no matter their creed. There is much to do, and the odds are slim, but Norris will save America."
USA_progressive_collaboration:0 "Progressive Collaboration"
USA_progressive_collaboration_desc:0 "The Progressives have long been outspoken allies of our cause, from Roosevelt to Mr. Floyd, the Progressives have always been great supporters of Democracy and the American Dream, and are the fiercest opponents of the Ku Klux Klan by far. It is only natural that we do our best to ally ourselves with them."
USA_emergency_intervention:0 "Emergency Intervention"
USA_emergency_intervention_desc:0 "This is not the time for doing what we can to help out the well off. Investment will always be a slow process, too slow. That's why we need to intervene now and make sure that every American is fed, clothed, and sheltered. Because if there's one thing that's worse than the economic crisis, it's the possibility of Radicals militantly putting the population into war."
USA_mcnary_plan:0 "McNary Plan"
USA_mcnary_plan_desc:0 "Republican Senator Charles McNary has a plan to help our farmers. We will implement higher domestic prices for farm products in order to help our farmers get back on their feet. The government will purchase some of these in order to assist them further. This will let farmers get back to work and some of their family members will be available for other projects."
USA_muscle_shoal_plan:0 "Muscle Shoal Plan"
USA_muscle_shoal_plan_desc:0 "The Tennessee River has previously served very little purpose for the United States. With President Norris's goal of Electrification taking great precedent over these past few months, a few of our engineers think that Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee would make it an idylic place for a Hydroelectric Dam! This would obviously serve as a great boon, not only for the engineering benefits, but also for electrification!"
USA_war_on_unemployment:0 "Mass Unemployment Relief"
USA_war_on_unemployment_desc:0 "Our people need to be able to live. To not support the hardest working people in our nation is suicide. Thus, President Norris will institute the biggest unemployment fund ever seen on the Western Hemisphere, so that we may get out of this crisis and into a brighter future!"
USA_war_on_the_klan:0 "Strike the White Leagues"
USA_war_on_the_klan_desc:0 "There is one group that has such notoriety that its mere mention can turn a room silent: The Ku Klux Klan. The KKK is by far the most dangerous terrorist group facing our shores in this massive crisis; their weekly political assassinations and voter suppression and intimidation efforts are unmatched. That is why we must attack them at their source. The President will declare that the various white leagues across the nation will be disbanded at once."
USA_southern_investments:0 "Southern Investments"
USA_southern_investments_desc:0 "Now that we've struck the worst of the bunch, it's time to move on to the average man. Before the KKK inevitably reforms, we have to convince the South that we are not the enemy; by increasing their quality of life, we might just be able to do that. Taking into account the socioeconomic reality that the South is the poorest region of the USA, perhaps by giving them special investment priority, they'll see that we're not the enemy."
USA_radical_republican_constiuency:0 "Revive a Radical Republican Constituency"
USA_radical_republican_constiuency_desc:0 "The Radical Republicans, America's forgotten Progressives. Ever since that fateful November in 1876, the once mightiest party faction in the RNC and even the nation has been nothing but a memory. That is, until we came along. It is time to revive this relic for the modern day, to remind all Americans that we're not radicals like the SPA or the AFP, but merely a rebirth of what was once the most powerful faction in America."
USA_jeffersonian_agrarianism:0 "Jeffersonian Agrarianism"
USA_jeffersonian_agrarianism_desc:0 "The South still sees us as Carpetbaggers seeking to replace their Agrarian way of life with some vauge notion of an Urbanist hell hole; they couldn't be further from the truth. We don't seek to uproot Agrarianism, just the opposite: we are the descendants of Jefferson when it comes to agriculture, and with our policies the South will turn into a paradise!"
USA_square_deal:0 "The Square Deal"
USA_square_deal_desc:0 "About 30 year ago, Teddy Roosevelt was President, and he had a dream. A dream of a square, fair deal. A dream that all Americans would be taken care of, not because of some Paternalistic idea of State Loyalty, but because it was simply the right thing to do. His successors failed at this, and it's up to us to finish it."

USA_infrastrucure_for_the_future_desc:0 "We're not thinking far ahead enough. In 30 some odd years, our new roads are going to be worthless! We need to plan ahead for the future, so that even if all else fails, Americans will still be able to rely on good, solid, infrastructure."
USA_dreams_of_henry_george:0 "Dreams of Henry George"
USA_dreams_of_henry_george_desc:0 "Henry George was a notable figure in the Progressive Era. His advocacy of a single tax on land, in which property taxes would be the only taxes people would pay, is very popular with our party, and our constituents. Let us embrace this idea, brought to us by Henry George, Thomas Paine, and John Locke. Towards a more prosperous future!"
USA_forresty_for_america:0 "Forestry for America"
USA_forresty_for_america_desc:0 "America was once not known for her massive Industry, but for her trees. Most people can remember the massive lumber mills that once populated every small town in the Northern United States. However, what is seldom talked about is the environmental aspect of the massive Lumber Industry. The once massive woodlands are slowly turning into depopulated swamps with the loss of the trees, and we cannot allow this to happen further"
USA_a_popular_vote:0 "A Popular Vote"
USA_a_popular_vote_desc:0 "The Electoral College, quite frankly, is anti democratic. There have been three elections where our supposed representatives have voted against the will of the people.

USA_fight_the_debt_desc:0 "We have engaged in significant deficit spending to get out of this economic crisis. While this hasn't necessarily harmed us yet, many of our politicians are urging us to make sure our debt does not become unmanageable. We should take measures to cut our debt, perhaps raising taxes on the wealthy would do the trick. They can handle it..."

USA_navy_in_command_desc:0 "After months of tension between the Navy and MacArthur, largely stemming from MacArthur's attempts to impose his will on the Navy and a perception that MacArthur's actions are endangering the war effort, the U.S. Navy has taken control of the government. Though they have apparently done so with the support of Congress and the Western Command Center, the alliance is a fragile one, and what will happen next is unknown..."

USA_admiral_leahy_desc:0 "William D. Leahy, nicknamed "the Judge" by his peers, has seized the reins of the country from Douglas MacArthur and now hopes to turn the nation on a path towards democracy once more.

USA_pacific_reconciliation:0 "Pacific Reconciliation"
USA_pacific_reconciliation_desc:0 "The loss of the Pacific Coast and all its resources was devastating for the war effort. If we are to mend the damage that MacArthur has done, we must reach out to the Pacific government and come to an agreement regarding the end of the war."
USA_naval_investments:0 "Naval Investments"
USA_naval_investments_desc:0 "It is the belief of Admiral Leahy that significant naval investment is necessary for a successful war effort. As seen in the First Civil War, the U.S. Navy can have a devastating impact on the ability of the enemy to continue fighting, and though MacArthur neglected this fact, we will not."
USA_court_the_rockies:0 "Court the Rockies"
USA_court_the_rockies_desc:0 "Though Douglas MacArthur was untrustworthy, his counterparts in the West are dedicated to American democracy. They have expressed a willingness to cooperate in any way necessary to restore the liberties we once cherished as citizens of this ravaged country. To further reassure these men, we must meet with Eisenhower and Bradley and prove to them that we will serve the United States, not our own interests."
USA_supreme_court_trial:0 "Supreme Court Trial"
USA_supreme_court_trial_desc:0 "With MacArthur and the men who hepled him coup the government in our hands, their fate must now be decided.

Their decision looms large over our administration and the country at large..."
USA_decision_of_congress:0 "Decision of Congress"
USA_decision_of_congress_desc:0 "Though Leahy has taken the reins of government from MacArthur, he is reluctant to remain in this position. Instead, we have left the decision of how we proceed with restoring democracy to Congress. We can only hope that they make the right decision for the country."
USA_savior_of_democracy:0 "The Savior of Democracy"
USA_savior_of_democracy_desc:0 "Though there is much work to be done, the situation within our own borders has stabilized. The U.S. Navy has saved democracy, and though we cannot end the Civil War so easily, we now have a righteous cause that will unify all true Americans to us!"
USA_admiral_king:0 "Admiral King"
USA_admiral_king_desc:0 "Admiral Ernest King tolerated MacArthur's insulting treatment of the U.S. Navy for months, but when MacArthur threatened to take direct control over the Navy, it became too much to handle. King did what he had to do-not just for the Navy, but for the country. Now that he is in charge though, we must focus on winning the war."
USA_the_blank_check:0 "The Blank Check"
USA_the_blank_check_desc:0 "Douglas MacArthur neglected industry during his brief time in power, whether it was concerned with the navy or otherwise. This state of affairs cannot continue. We must put the limited resources we possess to work producing vehicles, ships, and equipment for our military. To do so, King has announced a "Blank Check" for the econonmy; that is, an investment of however much money is necessary to win the war, regardless of its later reprecussions."
USA_protection_for_payment:0 "Protection for Payment"
USA_protection_for_payment_desc:0 "We cannot fund our growing navy without the resources to do so. To help us in this effort, Admiral King plans to offer U.S. Navy protection in exchange for various resources or other forms of financial compensation. Of course, if these regions fail to pay their due, we will act accordingly to ensure they have all the protection they will ever need, and of course, that we have everything we need too."
USA_congressional_subordination:0 "Congressional Subordination"
USA_congressional_subordination_desc:0 "Though Congress supported our efforts to oust MacArthur, they are now nothing more than a nuisance.

USA_secure_the_coastline:0 "Secure the Coastline"
USA_secure_the_coastline_desc:0 "Significant parts of our population, industry, and resources lie on or near the coast. Securing our own coastline is essential to guarding our territory, and securing the coastlines of our rivals will bring us one step closer to victory. The ability to blockade and starve the enemy cannot be underestimated, and as such, we will gain control over these areas at once."
USA_navy_first:0 "Navy First"
USA_navy_first_desc:0 "Though it has been neglected in recent years, Admiral King believes that it is never too late to shift resources towards the Navy. Through this investment, we will force our enemies in the Civil War into submission, and when that is done, perhaps we will have the strength to defend ourselves against other global powers as well. It is time the Navy had its due!"
USA_admiral_of_navy:0 "The Fleet Admiral"
USA_admiral_of_navy_desc:0 "It is time that Ernest King took on a title worthy of his position at the head of the American war effort.

USA_american_dockyards:0 "American Dockyards"
USA_american_dockyards_desc:0 "It is time that America surpassed the likes of Germany, Britain, Japan, and Canada, in her naval capacities.

USA_the_canal_we_built:0 "The Canal We Built"
USA_the_canal_we_built_desc:0 "The key to naval dominance in the Americas lies not only in the amount of ships we have, but also in our control over the Panama Control. However, our influence in this region has been threatened as of late, and given that we built the canal, it is only fair that we maintain our control over it. Let us move to secure it before another country can stop us."
USA_ports_of_the_atlantic:0 "Ports of the Atlantic"
USA_ports_of_the_atlantic_desc:0 "That we are surrounded on all sides by Englishmen and their lackeys is a fact that has been duly noted in King's administration, and it is a state of affairs we cannot allow. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans protect us, but they will only do so if they are firmly under our control. We must move at once to guarantee that it is America, not the Entente, that controls the Atlantic."
USA_the_beautiful_pacific:0 "The Beautiful Pacific"
USA_the_beautiful_pacific_desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean is a vast region, but it is one that we have dominated-at least until recently. Now, Japan, Germany, and the Entente alike threaten our interests there. King insists that our control over the Pacific territories is vital to any attempt to become a superpower in our own right. With our newfound naval strength, it should pose no risk to us..."
USA_end_the_anglo_empire:0 "End the Anglo Empire"
USA_end_the_anglo_empire_desc:0 "For too long, the British Navy has loomed large over the world, lording over its imperial possessions and now directly interfering in our affairs. Though King is no fan of syndicalists, the Canadian move to seize New England was a blatant denial of American sovereignty. Now we will teach these overmighty Brits a lesson."

USA_SPQA:0 "Senatus Populusque Americanus"
USA_SPQA_desc:0 "MacArthur, the quintessential tyrannical executive, has been pressured into stepping down in what is a victory for the legislative branch and for republicanism as a whole. We shall return to an older time in America, when Congress ruled the land, and presidents were too weak to impose their will upon the American people, as the British kings once did. Candidates for the major parties will be chosen from Congress to seek the presidency, and we shall enter a new era in our republic."  
USA_congressional_authority:0 "Congressional Authority"
USA_congressional_authority_desc:0 "Though our country has three equal branches of government, the executive branch has gained more and more power since the days of Abraham Lincoln. Perhaps it is best that an executive have power during a war; the Romans certainly thought so.

USA_new_amendments_desc:0 "The cries of our people have not fallen on deaf ears. The Civil War would have never occurred were it not for political malfeasance throughout our government.

USA_congress_restored:0 "Full Congressional Restoration"
USA_congress_restored_desc:0 "Congress has been fully restored to its old glory. Those who stepped down in recent times out of intimidation are returning, and new blood is coming to Washington as well. Gone are the extremist parties that tore the nation apart, and they are replaced by revitalized Democratic and Republican parties that work to represent all. Americans can safely write to their congressmen once more, and democracy is saved."
USA_classical_liberal_mandate:0 "The American Cincinnatus"
USA_classical_liberal_mandate_desc:0 "Though the temptation towards autocracy was great, America stood with its three branches intact, without giving up to executive authority. Congress is called into emergency session and the Appellate Courts are dealing with their mountain of paper trying to sort out the consequences. For his part, MacArthur is seen as a hero who did his duty to the country and stepped down when he was no longer needed."
USA_democratic_education:0 "Constitutional Education"
USA_democratic_education_desc:0 "A common talking point by radicals and populists was the idea that the Federal Government is a voluntary organization. Some even claim to use ridiculous false loopholes like naval law or the rights to secede from the union. We must correct this by making the U.S Constitution as widely available as possible."
USA_review_the_fed:0 "Review the Fed"
USA_review_the_fed_desc:0 "One of the things we must do to recover from the recent turmoil is to review the Federal Reserve. Some argue that we should privatize it, saying that it would be more efficient this way. Others want to fully abolish it, saying it is an institution that is not necessary to solve financial crises. There are also those who wish to reform it and make it a better institution. Regardless, we must make a decision regarding it." 
USA_bill_of_rights:0 "Bill of Rights Reminder"

We will promote Black politicians and allow Black people the right to vote, and make sure they have what they need to keep the Klan down."
USA_redeemer_collaboration:0 "Redeemer Collaboration"
USA_redeemer_collaboration_desc:0 "There are some members of the ODP and the Klan that our politicians insist we try to rehabilitate, likely due to the fact many of them were Democrats once. We will seek out the least radical and rabid among them and bring them back into the fold. In exchange, they will help us hunt down remaining Klan members. This may be unpopular with our Black citizens, yet it is necessary to restore order."

USA_local_control:0 "Local Industrialism"
USA_local_control_desc:0 "Many of our Social Democrats who are sympathetic to Syndicalist views have argued that we should implement a system of "Local Industrialism".

USA_traditional_machines:0 "Traditional Machines"
USA_traditional_machines_desc:0 "The Democratic Party has dominated the South for decades. In most of the region, the Republican Party doesn't even have any infrastructure.

USA_salute_the_patriots_desc:0 "MacArthur and his men have preserved the constitution, and have shown great restraint in doing so.

USA_civil_liberties:0 "Loyalty to America"
USA_civil_liberties_desc:0 "The early 1930s was the era of loyalty to men over ideals. Haywood, Long, and even Macarthur accrued a sort of clique of allies that saw their leaders as above the law. Several Congressmen have come out to apologize for their statements made during the war."

These ideas will be put before Congress and voted on, to show former AFP supporters that we hear them."
USA_political_traditionalism:0 "Political Traditionalism"
USA_political_traditionalism_desc:0 "The Democratic and Republican parties have served this country for decades.

### Post Civil War - Macarthur ###
USA_american_caeser:0 "The American Caesar"
USA_american_caeser_desc:0 "President MacArthur has proclaimed he would not concede victory to the very partisans who caused the civil war.

Elimination of unnecessary politicians and appointment of more competent officials will bridge the gap between people and politics."
USA_army_education:0 "Army Education"
USA_army_education_desc:0 "Parent Organizations have come out to claim we willingly let children into the military underage. Our solution is to divert prospective youth into military education while keeping them in public school.

USA_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "National Youth of America"

USA_americanism:0 "Loyal to the Flag"
USA_americanism_desc:0 "Unlike the tyrants and despots that are common in the Americas, MacArthur desires not to be a Great Man, but to be a respected and mortal leader of Americans. Loyalty to the unchanging ideal of America must be put above himself, so long as MacArthur's popularity holds out."
USA_martial_law_:0 "Martial Law"
USA_martial_law_desc:0 "With Congressional Approval, habeas corpus is suspended in accordance with the constitution. As the threat of invasion from syndicalist and populist forces still looms over part of the land, it is clear that we must act to ensure a secure transition to the post-Civil War era. The writ of habeas corpus and free speech is still suspended for political expediency, and we shall institute martial law to help find any remaining rebels."
USA_restore_democracy:0 "American Junta"
USA_restore_democracy_desc:0 "When the Roman Republic was in crisis, powerful generals rose up to save the country from itself. MacArthur's deal with Eisenhower and Bradley has been partly made public, though neither the American people nor the rest of the committee will know the nature of their relationship. We must now decide who else shall serve alongside these three men in the new Junta."
USA_defending_the_republic:0 "Fate of the Civilian Government"
USA_defending_the_republic_desc:0 "The events of the last few years have shown the military that politicians cannot be trusted to keep the peace. MacArthur is confident they can run the country better than the three branches ever did. Still, these men will retain their places in our government, a relic of older times if nothing else, while the Junta holds true power. The ruling "Committee" shall make important decisions in the country now."
USA_american_legion:0 "Utilize the Legion"
USA_american_legion_desc:0 "Smedley Butler's American Legion is now under our control, and it shall have an important place in our new regime. The Legion will keep the peace and hopefully snuff out any rebellions in their infancy, while also helping our law enforcement forces to make sure laws are followed. We will never have lawlessness in our nation again!"
USA_the_committee:0 "The Committee"
USA_the_committee_desc:0 "Our new ruling committee is made up of various military officials who will collectively govern the country in the name of the American people. This is the only way we can ensure that the country survives, and the military will now have the resources it so crucially lacked before the Civil War. Though MacArthur had to give up complete power, he is still the face of the regime, and holds significant power compared to his counterparts."
USA_navy_support:0 "Navy Support"
USA_navy_support_desc:0 "One faction of the military that we have yet to court is the Navy. The U.S. Navy, like the rest of the military, was torn apart by the Civil War, yet they also played a crucial part in our victory. Their popularity means our government will not be seen as fully legitimate until we bring them in the fold and offer them a place in the new ruling committee. For now, they cannot match the power of the Army, but we should watch them to make sure that this remains the case."
USA_air_power:0 "Air Power"
USA_air_power_desc:0 "Another important factor in the war was the airplane. Our airmen bravely battled in the air, over the sea, and over battlefields during the entire duration of the conflict, and now, they deserve investment. Lessons learned in the war can help us make our air force the best in the world; new technologies have been developed and new doctrines envisioned by our air commanders."`
USA_court_generals:0 "Court Dissenting Generals"
USA_court_generals_desc:0 "Some generals did not agree with our decision to establish a military junta over the country, instead wishing for a restoration of democracy. Others are bitter that they were excluded from the Committee and demand a say in the new government. We should bring these dissenters into the fold by offering them bribes, honors, or positions outside the Committee, so that we do not have to sleep with one eye open."
USA_backroom_deals:0 "Backroom Deals"
USA_backroom_deals_desc:0 "The relationship between MacArthur, Eisenhower, and Bradley has remained a closely kept secret, and for good reason. If other members of the Committee were made aware of the triumvirate that was developing between the three, perhaps they would be able to stop it. Soon though, the combined influence of the three men will be so great that they rule the country openly, as they already do in all but name."
USA_congress_courted:0 "The Question of Statehood"
USA_congress_courted_desc:0 "Unlike the First Civil War, we must deal with the majority of the country that decided to rebel. With the national government established, we should decide what to do with rebellious states. We could follow the lesson of that war and split the regions into various military districts until reconstruction is complete, or we could keep the states as they are. However, many states split during the war, and this could be difficult. Either way, we must decide carefully, for the sake of our regime."
USA_civilianization:0 "Civilianization"
USA_civilianization_desc:0 "To better adapt our people to the new regime, the members of the committee must decide how to govern. Should we don civilian clothing and resemble politicians, or shall we keep our military garb to intimidate would-be foes? There are various other ways we can come off as more friendly to our people as well, and we should decide how we want to appraoch the delicate matter of a military government."
USA_patriot_party:0 "A Patriot Party?"
USA_patriot_party_desc:0 "With the regime now more stable, perhaps we should adopt an institution that characterized American democracy for centuries, even if it has made Washington roll in his grave. Creating a new "Patriot Party" to represent the regime could help us gain legitimacy. However, others argue that we should distance ourselves from parties, as they are what brought the country to ruin to begin with. What shall we do?"
USA_congress_freed:0 "Congress Released"
USA_congress_freed_desc:0 "It is no longer neccessary for Congress to be protected by and to answer to the American military. Special elections in our core states have decided who will guide Congress during Reconstruction, and the people may once again expect to vote for their national leaders on a regular basis. Congress is free of the shackles imposed on it during the war, finally ready to help restore the country."
USA_fbi_cointelpro:0 "Second American Protective League"
USA_fbi_cointelpro_desc:0 "As the largest part of the Continuous United States has been pacified, it is essential that American citizens remain vigilant. The reformation of the League as a free information system to report potential populist or syndicalist spies to the Federal Government and to discourage public protest is absolutely needed."
USA_control_congress:0 "Control Congress"
USA_control_congress_desc:0 "Many former Democrats and Republicans have folded into MacArthur's new regime, while holdouts have fled. Fortunately, we were able to fill their vacancies with qualified, trustworthy individuals. These new Congressmen are not politicians per se, they are instead public servants for the American people."
USA_office_of_war_information:0 "Signals Intelligence Service"
USA_office_of_war_information_desc:0 "Cryptographic machines designed to interact with its sender to create an encryption that cannot be easily broken are the newest toy in our arsenal. The Signals Intelligence Service, which required the installation of underground cables to ensure secrecy, has finally been implemented."
USA_allien_sedition_acts:0 "Executive Order 7250-A"
USA_allien_sedition_acts_desc:0 "An Executive Order signed by President MacArthur hopes to bring an end the threat of foreign infiltration. This order restores some parts of the Alien and Sedition Act. State legislatures are already appealing cases to the Supreme Court. It is firmly believed, however, that MacArthur's new judges will side in his favor."
USA_empower_the_army:0 "Empower the Army"
USA_empower_the_army_desc:0 "A crisis has already risen in our new military administration. The Army and Navy are constantly at each other's throats over funding and political kickbacks. We need to relegate the Navy to a secondary governmental position and grant the Army full power."
USA_loyal_officers:0 "Old Soldiers Never Die"
USA_loyal_officers_desc:0 "The new regime recognizes the long struggle of the officers that left their homes to protect their nation, and to the many that didn't return home. Thanks to an Executive Order, Officers may now pursue a technical education in universities or go into law. This will ensure loyalty long after we fade away."
USA_loyalty_to_macarthur:0 "The Commander-in-Chief"
USA_loyalty_to_macarthur_desc:0 "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington. Washington set the precedent of retiring from active duty upon taking office, which MacArthur promises he will do once the national emergency is ended. Like Washington, MacArthur will remain ready to respond to threats to the nation."
USA_national_rehabilition:0 "National Rehabilitation"
USA_national_rehabilition_desc:0 "The creeds of Long and Haywood were wrong: it was not the industrialists and businessmen that caused civil strife, but the greedy career politician that gave them posts and took their money. We shall rehabilitate the capitalists to their proper position in American society."
USA_root_out_traitors:0 "Down With the Traitors"
USA_root_out_traitors_desc:0 "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America. They are the disloyal Prohibitionists, Grangers, Holy Rollers and foreigners that enabled the AFP and SPA to grow. These organizations have been rightfully banned for their implicit betrayal."
USA_loyalty_to_america:0 "Up With the Stars"
USA_loyalty_to_america_desc:0 "Nationalism has the goal of strengthening loyalty to the idea of America more than any American as a person. President MacArthur has chosen to refocus attention from himself to the nation as an object of admiration. No longer will a politicians ego exceed their stature, as the nation is mightier than they."
USA_american_stratocracy:0 "American Stratocracy"
USA_american_stratocracy_desc:0 "MacArthur has finally restored nationalist fervour and functional Democracy as he sees it. While some complain that career politicians have been replaced by officers, few will argue that the bureaucracy hasn't improved. The American people can now trust their politicians to use legal means to achieve their goals."
USA_defend_the_republic:0 "Defenders of the Republic"
USA_defend_the_republic_desc:0 "The militaries job is to defend American democracy at all costs, but only directly intervening to prevent the collapse of the Republic and only for as long as neccessary. This is the message we must spread throughout the ranks and in our public propaganda, both so that the American people accept MacArthur's time as leader and so the military remembers what their legitimacy is based on."
USA_the_junta:0 "American Junta"
USA_the_junta_desc:0 "MacArthur understands that he cannot rule the nation alone, and that the old democratic system is similary insufficient. Instead, he believes a council of high-ranking military officials will be able to work together to stabilize the nation. This would appease the loyal officials in the W.C.C. and would also remove the problem of establishing a successor, for now..."
USA_civil_autonomy:0 "Civil Autonomy"
USA_civil_autonomy_desc:0 "While the American junta wants as much control as possible, they understand that they cannot be everywhere at once. We will retain some of the old American practices, such as giving states and businesses some autonomy with regards to economic policy. This will make things more efficient, and lead to the creation of greater infrastructure in many of our devastated states."
USA_military_purchases:0 "Military Purchases"
USA_military_purchases_desc:0 "Never again will the United States be weak or unprepared for war. We will encourage the creation of whole industries in certain states, so that different regions of our country can specialize in different areas. The national government will then purchase from these factories, boosting the local economies in those communities as well as helping our military."
USA_limited_elections:0 "Safer Elections"
USA_limited_elections_desc:0 "Recent years have shown us the dangers of unregulated democracy. Instead, our people will choose their representatives from a list of military officials. Doing so will ensure that they are under the tight control of the ruling junta, and that a more consistent ideology can be advocated. No longer will the changes made by one man be undone as soon as his successor comes to power. This will stabilize our system."  
USA_protect_capitalism:0 "Capital Security Acts"
USA_protect_capitalism_desc:0 "The recent Second Civil War was the greatest threat to American capitalism in history. The junta will make a concentrated effort to preserve pre-war capitalism with new "Capital Security Acts". These will ensure that corporate money is guarded and will not be stolen or destroyed by anarchists. The injection of confidence into the business community will boost our economy."
USA_the_triumverant:0 "American Triumvirate"
USA_the_triumverant_desc:0 "Two men have come to prominence alongside MacArthur in the American junta. Dwight Eisenhower, a loyal man and a hard worker with a certain charisma about him, has risen to the top. Omar Bradley, a humble but mature man, has also emerged as a leading figure within the junta. Together, these three men will rule America as they see fit. All opposition will be crushed."

USA_all_american_legion_desc:0 "We will have an American Protection Legion, which will replace the old American Protective League.

USA_mandatory_service:0 "Total Patriotism"
USA_mandatory_service_desc:0 "Building on the amendment he drafted, MacArthur has now decided to implement mandatory service for a wider age group, to cement his position at the top of America.

USA_little_troopers:0 "Little Troopers"
USA_little_troopers_desc:0 "The Boy Scouts are a nice organization, but we need to raise young men who are ready for war. To this end, we will create the "Little Troopers" program, which will train young kids for real military service when they have come of age. This will give us desperately needed manpower to replace our losses in the Civil War, and make our population more patriotic." 
USA_baracks_capitalism:0 "Barracks Capitalism"
USA_baracks_capitalism_desc:0 "As of late, the phrases "Military-Industrial Complex" and "Barracks Capitalism" have been used more frequently to describe the new form of capitalism that MacArthur has pushed.

USA_salute_the_chief_desc:0 "Hail to the Chief! All Americans will salute the man who has saved our country from extremists and foreign rule.

USA_constitutional_amending:0 "Improve the Constitution"
USA_constitutional_amending_desc:0 "MacArthur's source of power is the military. However, he has expressed concern to some of his close advisors that the end of Civil War will see the U.S. return to having a weak military. To combat this, MacArthur has advocated an amendment to the constitution that would help create a permanent war machine, beginning with mandating that men of a certain age serve in the armed forces."

USA_rebuild_railroads_desc:0 "The Railroad networks that cross America are in shambles, and war-era constructions are jury-rigged to older tracks.

USA_business_subsidies:0 "Business Subsidies"
USA_business_subsidies_desc:0 "Small businesses in America have struggled to expand their employment opportunities, which is contributing to unemployment.

USA_rebuild_americas_industry_desc:0 "America's exports have fallen during the depression despite taking a laissez-faire position on trade laws.

USA_economic_investments:0 "Economic Investments"

USA_trial_of_american_companies_desc:0 "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of the rebellious companies.

The police are barely able to handle the clashes between the ODP and SPA members, but with the AFP also in the mix and massively upset with the loss of Long, things have spun out of control.

These actions came to hurt the mainstream Democrat Party in the same way the 1912 election destroyed their rivals. While this would not have been a problem normally, the expansion of the Old Democrat Party to areas outside of the Solid South has been a worrying development. Worse, we have seen Klan activity spread further outside of the Solid South in much larger numbers than we have ever seen before. The time has come to investigate both the ODP and the Ku Klux Klan."

However, with Hoover's first term, he calmed tensions with the SPA. When the SPA began to evolve into the CSA and participate as a major part of it, this coalition of trade unions across the Midwest began to use political violence for their own ends. Such violence increasingly occurred between members of the CSA and the Klan and Old Democratic Party. The Failure of the SPA in 1932 lead to election violence across the Midwest between members of the SPA and various other political parties from Old Democrat Party members all the way to members of the Progressive Party. With the SPA's second defeat, now in the 1936 election, we have seen massive riots across the Midwest and various Strikes occurring.

### Events - Pre Election ###

ustates.1.t:0 "The United States in 1936"
ustates.1.d:0 "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. Relieved it had managed to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, Woodrow Wilson was the first US president to run and win a third-term as the “Man Who Kept the Peace” alongside his new running mate, former Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer. This political victory was short-lived however as Wilson suffered a stroke shortly after his election, setting off a constitutional crises and struggle for power in the cabinet until Wilson died in late 1923. Until then Wilson, Palmer and the cabinet reacted to the French and British Revolutions and growth of American syndicalism with increasingly extreme crackdowns on union organizing and eventually a slew of organizations suspected to have connections to the radical left. As workers became increasingly radicalized and anarchist bombers made several attempts on Palmer’s life the political situation deteriorated alongside the economy due to a combination of strikes, political instability and a loss of trading partners. \n\nPalmer’s own controversial presidency ended with the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928 who attempted to calm the situation with a “Return to Normalcy”, re-legalizing non-violent syndicalist outlets. This ultimately did little to help as a cumulation of speculative investing sent the United States spiraling into the 1929 Great Panic and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed to reverse the decline of the American economy and the Great Panic has created one of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This has fueled the rise of radical politics in America such as the far-left Socialist Party of America, the populist Share the Wealth Society under Huey Long and his national America First Party, and the far-right Old Democratic Party, which places the blame of syndicalist and civil rights uprisings at the feet of immigrants, Republican cosmopolitism and liberal toleration of the left. Hoover's contentious re-election through the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."

ustates.1200.d:0 "The United States Secretary of Commerce Roy D. Chapin has died today due to a severe heart attack. A close ally of Herbert Hoover within the Republican Party, Chapin has desperately attempted to work with businesses, especially those in the motor industry, to undo the severeness of the Great Depression. With Vice President Charles Curtis only having survived his own heart attack earlier this month due to it occuring in the White House with medical staff on stand-by, many see this as both a symbolic and literal example of the old political class passing away in favor of new movements although the Republican Party has protested such claims."

ustates.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits America"
ustates.2.d:0 "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Great Panic of 1929. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Haywood, William H. Murray and Long finally seem to agree on something as they have all railed against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."
ustates.2.a:0 "This is just not our year."

ustates.3.t:0 "National Unity Agreement"
ustates.3.d:0 "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America, the America First Party, or the Old Democrats would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed by the Republican Party, in which they will nominate a member of both the conservative and progressive wings of their party to their ticket to guarantee a moderate platform. As part of the agreement the Republicans will not run candidates in the “Solid South” to give traditional democrats a better chance and likewise will not run party-endorsed candidates in Progressive heavy areas. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength. Most importantly, all parties agree that whichever party between the three of them wins a plurality of the vote for President will be endorsed by the other two parties for President in the House of Representatives. Despite his lack of public popularity President Hoover is still head of the Republican Party his support would be invaluable to gaining support for the plan from more Senators."

Representing the parties moderate conservatives is Charles Curtis, vice-President of the United States who is well-renowned for his negotiating abilities amongst politicians, giving him a moderate's appeal that crosses party lines. However, representing the more liberal wing of the party is famed businessman and Kansas Governor Alf Landon whom favors more direct economic intervention in the economy and could win over progressive Republicans whom recently defected to the left-leaning Progressive Party. While the loser will be the others vice-presidential candidate to show party solidarity Hoover using his little remaining political capital to back a candidate could make or break them."

Although they are quite conservative they are facing stiff competition from their right and primary challenges from the Old Democrats as well as challenges to their power by populist America First party supporters. Although the Republican Party and the Southern Democrats have long been mortal enemies many liberals nonetheless consider them a neccessary bulwark for a coalition in favor of liberal democracy when the election comes about. With many conservative Democrats already becoming Old Democrats in all but name should we stop the bleeding by giving electoral boosts by signing off on some of their pork belly requests, despite them being our historical opposition?"

Garner is a well-known anti-radical who won the nomination on the back of two promises: to preserve the economic progress made by Wilson and to preserve liberty at all costs. As Wilson remains controversial even within the party this raised a fair amount of debate and angered members of the party who felt Garner was too conservative and out-of-touch to be president. Nonetheless, he has much more support than not within what remains of a Democratic Party that is increasingly being absorbed by either the Old Democrats on its right-wing or the AFP and Progressives on its left. Garner's promise to preserve democracy without giving into any form of radicalism and denouncing those who would give extreme compromises to them is appealing to many fearful of America's increasing political unstability."

Saying the problems in the American political system was a symptom of unfair economic policies and lack of opportunity, Norris endorsed a massive project to reinvest in poor communities and work with union leaders to not only stabilize the country but "make it truly fair".

Originally a faction formed as a reaction to the growth of syndicalism and a reinvigorated civil rights movement, it also gained strength as a result of Woodrow Wilson and A. Mitchell Palmer's encouraging of increasingly radical forms of anti-socialism during the First Red Scare. Republican tariffs during the Great Depression that have harmed agriculture have led to greater support for the movement. Today, they declared their nominee for president to be their longtime de-facto leader and Governor of Oklahoma, William H. Murray, who said that he's running a campaign against "Communists, Corporations and Miscegenation".

Those under the radical banner in their political enclaves have received some social welfare with Share Our Wealth donations from the AFP, International Red Aid from the SPA and the machine handouts and White League protections from the Old Democrats.

Patrolling the party strongholds and party rallies, these well-armed and equipped paramilitary units have already engaged in scattered, though extremely violent conflicts.

Joe DiMaggio, who returned to form almost immediately after the conclusion of the war, has had a breakout year, hitting safely in an unprecedented 56 consecutive games- a record unlikely to ever be broken. Even as the Dodgers are coming into this series the clear underdog, many Brooklyn fans are believing they can pull it off.

Much of their success was due to recent acquisition Joe Medwick from St. Louis, who out-hit DiMaggio throughout the entire series. A close call occurred in game four, when Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen nearly made an error that cost them the game but the Dodgers recovered one play later, ending the game and securing momentum for the eventual Los Angeles victory.

While many are expecting the so-called "Mainstream Parties" to back one another the Old Democrats are attempting to court conservatives while the SPA demands progressives back them or be held responsible for a 'reactionary' victory.

While we could attempt to forestall this coup it's fairly obvious that MacArthur's wing of the military is preparing to accept the offer and may have instigated the entire arrangement.

Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression in order to discredit syndicalism and the worker needs further empowerment Haywood has moved to nationalize the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. This includes stopping banks from foreclosing on bankrupt homeowners. A filibuster by Senator Bricker has forced Haywood to resort to an Executive Order, appealing to the public good and claiming the control capital has over Congress is too great to overcome otherwise.

To most of Haywood's cabinet, it was clear that private mining companies would be entirely unable to balance the needs of the public with their greed and that they would favor the imperialist powers in the coming wars, and therefor have moved to kill two birds with one stone by nationalizing the drilling and mining companies, included Standard Oil.

As such the Revolutionary Committee is unsure about what to do with him, with the more hardline radicals like William Z.

In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Long has pledged to defend the interest of the people and to put the interest of the regular American above anyone else.

This will reverse the price slump that is driving farmers into poverty. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict that is going on in America, Long passed the executive order bypassing Congress entirely.

However, attempting to appoint everyone from 'moderate' Socialists to conservative Democrats to his cabinet has proved a problem as some are flatly refusing to join, with some leftists being especially upset at the idea of Herbert Hoover being appointed Secretary of Commerce and rightists disliking Smedley Butler being appointed Secretary of War. Of course Charles Coughlin presses us to just double down on AFP appointees and only appoint other parties who will accept this.

Unsurprisingly however, one after another has turned down his offer, with Rockefeller calling him a 'fool'. While some relatively 'small-time' millionares seem open to the plan it is clear the giants are not, causing (or perhaps just allowing) Long to go on the offensive, decrying their lack of patriotism."

This combination has led to outcries in Congress of authoritarianism, while Long attempts to deal with this by calling congressmen who oppose him tools of big business. His popularity among the common people has fanatically increased as a result but Washington obviously remains opposed, calling it unconstitutional and a wild overreach of his powers, while the more radical of his opponents promise to use their paramilitaries to defend themselves from Long."

Naturally Congress is in an uproar and has denounced the action as the latest in a series of self-serving AFP acts, though the unaffiliated populace appear to be with Long.

As the debate drags on Long is increasingly being accused of attempting to shove through the policy on his own terms and of wanting a centralized, tyrannical government, with AFP opponents believing that to hand the AFP control of banking would be handing them the nation despite Long's insistence that the bank directors will be democratically elected. Thankfully however it seems many Americans, especially those in AFP territory, are supportive of the plan and view it as a vindication of the AFP's presentation of Long as a man of the people."

Long has lumped in Standard Oil with these major financial forces, and has stated that he will have any congressmen involved in corrupt dealings with John D.

As such we are combining the Minutemen with the national guard to take back the cities but the military is upset that Long shoved through his program without consulting him and the ODP is using the opportunity to take pot shots at the SPA and build themselves up without allying Long, seemingly hoping the two will wear each other down."

Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the both the Deep South and parts of the North controlled by the Klan. It has quickly noticed that the government has no remaining authority within parts of the South and Mid-East."

ustates.63.d:0 "Long's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today to restore order, having declared Long to be a tyrant and attempted to arrest him at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, Long was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to New Orleans. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."

### President Murray ###

ustates.6300.t:0 "Murray's Inaugural Address"
ustates.6300.d:0 "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and William H. Murray is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with John E. Rankin being sworn in as the Vice President with the support of Conservative Democrats and the right-wing "fringe" of the Republican Party giving him just enough support to take Congress. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Murray has pledged to defend the interest of the American people and to destroy those who would threaten them. Naturally this has outraged the SPA and the ODP's slim coalition in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the senate where an assortment of Democratic, Republican, Progressive and of course SPA senators have promised to filibuster any law they see as detrimental to America."
ustates.6300.a:0 "God Bless America."

ustates.6301.t:0 "Haywood and Long reinforce militias!"
ustates.6301.d:0 "In response to Murray's inauguration both Bill Haywood and Huey Long have doubled down on reinforcing their respective militias, seemingly dropping any pretense of not offically being their leaders. Condemning Murray as a threat to democracy, Long demands he stay clear of AFP territory while Haywood all but promises future conflict."
ustates.6301.a:0 "Traitors!"

ustates.6302.t:0 "Bankers Resist!"
ustates.6302.d:0 "As the establishment class resists our bill to break up banks and have those in ODP territory controlled by the states, it becomes clear we can not pass our desired legislation through Congress and executive orders will have to suffice. On the plus side, Murray's anti-bank activities has increased his popularity with the common people."
ustates.6302.a:0 "Fools"

ustates.6303.t:0 "Penalizing the corrupt"
ustates.6303.d:0 "It is obvious that the bankers and lobbyists have to much influence in DC, often working for the good of their own pockets than the people. As such Murray has announced he shall dig through every corrupter working against the ODP to find the crimes they have committed and prosecute them whenever possible. Of course, this announcement has set off a firestorm of hatred among the other parties but will weaken the corrupt establishment."
ustates.6303.a:0 "Good!"

ustates.6304.t:0 "Rockefeller Investigated!"
ustates.6304.d:0 "The Oil Tycoon John D. Rockefeller has aligned himself with Republican politics and greed for too long, and now he is paying the price of putting profit among national brotherhood. Employees of Rankin and Ford have found evidence of price-fixing and undercutting competitors. Despite the outcries of his agents is time to announce we intend to put him on trial, and every congressman who has connections to him."
ustates.6304.a:0 "Good!"

ustates.6306.t:0 "Smith Act Blocked!"
ustates.6306.d:0 "The Smith Act would simultaneously end non-white and non-protestant immigration to the United States while reintroducing forms of segregation to the North, including banning Whites from marrying Jews and those with more a quarter of black blood. However the act has virtually no chance of passing Congress as basically only ODP congressmen and a handful of breakaways from other parties are willing to vote for it. As such an executive order will need to be enacted."
ustates.6306.a:0 "They forced our hand!"

ustates.6307.t:0 "Congress Protests!"
ustates.6307.d:0 "Congress is openly protesting our most recent executive accusing Murray of being an extremist demagogue. Already the AFP and SPA are mobilizing against us and the Establishment appears to be making negotiations with the military to restrain Murray. It appears as though we are being literally forced from office in short time although our executive acts has made us even more popular among those who leaned towards us."
ustates.6307.a:0 "Traitors!"

ustates.6308.t:0 "MacArthur forces out Murray"
ustates.6308.d:0 "William H. Murray's time is up as he has fled for the ODP controlled Georgia after hearing of MacArthur's clique planning to coup him. MacArthur has announced that Murray and all other radicals threatening America will have to stand down and allow a return to ordinary democratic politics, basically demanding that all militias disband and accept the constitution."
ustates.6308.a:0 "This is the only way"

ustates.6309.t:0 "Hitting Long"
ustates.6309.d:0 "Huey Long's Minutemen have come under increasing attack in recent days, and the ODP is loudly denouncing the congressmen aligned with them. With our attempts to occupy the Midwest incuring the wrath of the AFP and resulting in guerilla attacks on ODP militants in turn, we have been more succesful in weeding out Share Our Wealth socieities in the deep South. The SPA have fought our attempts to bring troops into the Steel Belt to attack the AFP however out of paranoia that they are actually there to fight the Red Guard, or at least will be once we're done with Long. Long himself has left Congress for Louisiana and already Congress is upset as they view Murray as using federal forces to empower the ODP by stomping on his enemies, fully expecting him to come for them next."
ustates.6309.a:0 "That ought to teach him a lesson."

ustates.6310.t:0 "Hitting Haywood"
ustates.6310.d:0 "Our strikes on the Red Guard in the Steel Belt has been met with enthusiastic applause among the ODP, mixed reactions among the Democrats and of course total aversion by the SPA whom believe that we will soon be coming after them as well which is basically correct as we hold them to account for their attacks on America. While the SPA has taken a beating in the Steel Belt they are striking back as Red Guards resort to Guerilla warfare although we have eradicated the holdouts in the Southeast who were giving the ODP trouble. Most establishment members of Congress however view this as basically irresponsible and dangerous, with a widespread conspiracy theory amongst them that Murray is just using their forces against Haywood to cement the ODP's power before likely turning on them."
ustates.6310.a:0 "We'll break Haywood in short order"

ustates.6311.t:0 "The General Strike Spreads"
ustates.6311.d:0 "With the Red Guard slowly building strength against us and our insaction, the SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. Meanwhile Long's AFP has likewise been coordinating against us. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces, Old Democrats or even with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention. Soon war will be coming."
ustates.6311.a:0 "A disaster!"

### President Curtis/Landon ###

ustates.64.t:0 "Presidential Inauguration"
ustates.64.dc:0 "After his election, Curtis addressed the nation. Curtis called for patience and civility in these difficult times. Curtis was quoted as saying 'A nation cannot be preserved which does not preserve its citizens. Industry is reducing wages, lowering the standard of living, destroying buying power, this cannot be the way we solve our economic problems.' Reinvigorated with his unlikely victory, Curtis boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary. Whether the rest of the nation would listen to the message was another story."
ustates.64.dl:0 "Alf Landon was sworn in as the 31st president of the United States of America today. At his inaugural address Landon spoke of the challenges facing the nation in preserving a liberal democacy. Landon was quoted as saying 'Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization. And I think I will awaken America to that.' Landon concluded with a promise to solve the Depression with entrepreneurship. Creating a new generation of millionaires that will bring pride back to the nation. Whether anyone will listen is another matter."
ustates.64.dz:0 "Herbert Hoover was sworn in again as the president of the United States of America today. President Hoover Inauguration speech called for calm in these times of difficulty and how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Hoover is quoted as saying "America is a great social and economic experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose.""
ustates.64.a:0 "America is One Nation Indivisible!"

ustates.65.t:0 "Republicans Announce Negotiations"
ustates.65.dc:0 "President Curtis has announced that his first priority as president is to end the most recent strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Bill Haywood in Chicago to negotiate. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers. Our negotiators believe that Curtis's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA, but President Curtis is determined."

ustates.65.a:0 "This is the only way"

ustates.66.t:0 "Haywood Accepts Invitation"
ustates.66.d:0 "Bill Haywood has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. An FBI intelligence file on Haywood indicates that he and other SPA leaders were worried that their right-wing would defect if he outright turned it down meaning he is less than thrilled to be present but must make at least a show of quasi-good will. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of the President's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavour. They say he is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
ustates.66.a:0 "I survived a heart attack, I can handle this"
ustates.66.b:0 "Good, the Republic may survive after all"

ustates.67.t:0 "Negotiations Begin"
ustates.67.dc:0 "Curtis gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'With these negotiations we continue the great American tradition of achieving peace through compromise, progress through understanding and democracy through mutual agreement. May our efforts today fulfill the spirit of the Constitution and preserve the liberty of all Americans.' President Curtis and Bill Haywood have sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago. Though mid-starting the negotiations word arrived that both Huey Long and (upon hearing of Long's request) William H. Murray have demanded to be at the negotiations despite our diplomats already telling them they would be seen after Haywood. Their presence will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing could incite the AFP and ODP to such a degree as to make success in Chicago worthless. Even Haywood himself seems to want them to be present if only to be certain that Curtis will tell them all the same thing without giving the others too much."
ustates.67.dl:0 "Landon gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'Many are concerned that talking to ones adversies is a form of weakness.

ustates.68.t:0 "Desire for Autonomy"
ustates.68.d:0 "Haywood, Long and Murray have made it clear they believe the working man is being stiffed but have wildly different ways of achieving their goals. However, the Home Rule plans to allow each to implment their ideas in their respective regions. Haywood demands that we make a show of goodwill by ending all attempts to end the general strike, essentially pulling much of our forces out of the region. The AFP and ODP have stated that if we are to follow through on such a thing we will have to do the same for them and order MacArthur's military forces to stand down. Of course Haywood nearly blew up the negotations by stating that pulling forces away from ODP strongholds would simply make it easier for the Red Guard to eventually overrun them but it was a threat Murray simply chuckled at and invited him to try his best. After Long and the President reminded both men that the US Army remained the issue at hand they thankfully stopped their fighting for the moment."
ustates.68.a:0 "Very Well"
ustates.68.b:0 "Haywood needs to make a better offer"

ustates.69.t:0 "D.C. Denounced"
ustates.69.d:0 "With their rejection from the meeting, William H. Murray and Huey Long have both denounced President [USA.GETLeader] for meeting with an "anarchist" before them. Both are riling their supporters, with the AFP demanding for Long to be allowed into the meeting room and the ODP already declaring D.C. a corrupt establishment beyond salvation, caving into radicalism. Governors and Congressman from their respective factions are already nodding in agreement with these sentiments and are reportedly outright meeting with their respective militia leaders. Haywood, upon hearing this, has decided to return to the Steel Belt to organize the SPA, demanding that President [USA.GETLeader] put down both the ODP and AFP in the meantime if Curtis wants him to return. It's unlikely that such a thing is possible without Civil War, however."
ustates.69.a:0 "We have failed"

ustates.6900.t:0 "Haywood calls [USA.GETLeader] Corrupt"
ustates.6900.d.c:0 "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepreneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. Now that he has attempted to close ranks with big business Haywood and the SPA view this as the smoking gun that Landon is a traitor to people. Though to many these accusations have rang hollow citing Landon as a man with the business connections attempting to improve the economy, the radicals seem convinced."

While he supported negotiations as a step in the right direction he also recently spoke about how President [USA.GETLeader] only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of [USA.GETLeader]'s fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. The President, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish baboon - much to the AFP's outrage."

ustates.70.t:0 "Funding Demanded"
ustates.70.d:0 "As the meeting in Chicago began in earnest, it quickly became clear that all of the men present had only one factor in common: to bring back something of benefit to their constituents. They have demanded that each of their parties be given a lump cash subsidy by the government for fighting the depression. While this will be a show of goodwill and they will all walkout if refused, it threatens to empower radicals should the negotations fail. And, of course, none of them will be happy to see the others getting funding, meaning we will have to concede more in the negotiations."
ustates.70.a:0 "Agree"
ustates.70.b:0 "Disagree"

ustates.71.t:0 "Murray's Demands"
ustates.71.d:0 "Despite having a reputation of being a 'fighter' known for making outrageous and offensive statements in public, Old Democrat leader William H. Murray is very clearly more shrewd in private. He has unsurprisingly fought tooth and nail to keep Long and Haywood from getting more power in their home regions but before they gave up on him he finally has an offer for everyone at the table. If the Socialists and AFP "pull out" from the Old Democrats regions and instead invite their most prominent supporters to live in their own regions, he will vote for increased autonomy. However, with this autonomy he wants Federal investigations into the White Leagues within the Mason-Dixie line reduced, calling this a 'local matter', and a public promise for the President to respect states rights. Finally, on top of all this, he wants a substantial investment into the rural South... by giving yet another large grant for Murray and the ODP to do with as they see fit. This would effectively ensure the Old Democrats rule from Indiana to Florida for the foreseeable future but it is the only hope for the Home Plan to work."
ustates.71.a:0 "Agree"
ustates.71.b:0 "Never!"

ustates.7100.t:0 "Radicals Upset!"
ustates.7100.d:0 "Haywood and his entourage are upset that we have agreed to Murray's demands to give the Old Democrats greater control of his region, viewing it as a betrayal of the workers whom have supported him in the region. Long on the other hand seems willing to agree so long as there is a 'ceasefire' between the two, meaning that Long will not work to expand his influence among the Old Democrats but will keep those party machines which already exist and will 'suggest' (as he 'officially' has no control over them) the Minutemen cease aggressive acts between them. AFL leader Samuel Gompers has been called into a meeting between the President and Haywood to delegate between the two and he came up with his own compromise. While the SPA will cease to encourage growth in the south they will be given even greater control of the North, a large grant to do what they wish with, protectionism shall stay the norm with the Entente and the federal Government will make no attempt to cease the so-called 'Combined Syndicates' from aiding the syndicalist movement in other parts of the world. Haywood has reluctantly agreed believing it will aid more workers in the long-run and, of course, it is likely he believes the Syndicalist Movement can liberate the American South once he can help it become the unipolar ideology of the world. The only question now is if the Republicans will agree. Of course Long has seen an opening to also demand that the AFP be compensated for going along with this deal with a larger grant which they can spend on their rural and unemployed supporters."

ustates.72.t:0 "Issue of the Militias"

It is unlikely that peace, democracy or respect for the Federal Government can last if these militias continue to grow. The Republican cabinet has requested that each faction cease funding militia recruitment outside their territory and that militias register with state governments and are therefor legally accountable and regulated. Others in Congress want them disarmed at once however, stating that it's the only way to ensure peace. While the faction leaders have agreed to the former so long as the others yank out of 'their' regions it is unlikely they would go with the latter, though MacArthur has suggested that if we blindsided them and disarmed the militias at once they would have to go with it. Few others are confident this plan would work."

ustates.73.t:0 "Compromise Achieved"
ustates.73.d:0 "The Home Rule Act of 1937 has passed with the federal government agreeing to give far more autonomy to AFP, ODP and SPA states in terms of their economic and social policies in return for turning down their militia recruitment, ceasing their current strikes, rioting, party recruitment in other areas of the states and aggressive action against both us and each other amongst our other demands. The Socialists now currently transitioning Chicago and Detroit to semi-syndicalist systems where workers are universally unionized and own shares of production, the AFP have begun implementing a smaller and local variant of Share the Wealth and the ODP have implemented a combination of more "nativist" laws and anti-corporate policies in the American Southeast. While many within the cabinet do not like giving them control even to this degree this level of decentralization has defused each while allowing us to focus on the West and East where the federal government is still most influential while disarming them of being an outright threat on the national level while giving each major constituency what they want."

While government officials attempted to urge calm, Murray's words have struck a chord across the nation, especially the South, firing up ODP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them.

Of course this has only confirmed to the various radicals and populists that the US government was beyond saving, although MacArthur's soldiers seem prepared to fight.

Haywood has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. 'What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed," Haywood declared in a Minneapolis speech. 'What they get instead is a government that acts at the behast of their capitalist overlords.

ustates.84.a:0 "What next?"

ustates.85.t:0 "March on Detriot"
ustates.85.d:0 "The Old Democrats, America First Party, Socialist Party of America and National Guard have once again come into conflict in Michigan when Old Democrats sought to take the Socialists to task for causing yet another strike that is exasperrating the economy. Old Democrat leaders blamed the weakness of the government in not finishing off "revolutionary leftists" and opposing the efforts of the Old Democrats to complete the goals of Woodrow Wilson and Arnold Palmer in finishing off the radicals and that the distant Federal Government bureaucrats was instead sympathetic to them and the AFP's "false egalitarianism". The official Old Democrat newsletter went on to blame the AFP and  for encouraging political corruption and the growth of the bureaucratic state while denouncing minorities in the government and which both the AFP and Socialist Party collaborate with. They ended by saying that they were organizing a march on Detroit to protest socialist behavior."
ustates.85.a:0 "That's not good"

ustates.86.t:0 "Counter Protest Organized!"
ustates.86.d:0 "In response to nearby Old Democrats such as Claire Hoffman helping organize the 'March on Detriot' Bill Haywood announced that a counter-protest of Red Militants will be present to protect strikers, workers and socialists from "reactionary extremists, racists and chauvinists" and warned the Old Democrats to stay away, claiming that "The forces of reaction will be sorry if they appear on the doorstep of the revolution". In response Huey Long, whom no doubt did not care for Murray's insults against him and Haywood being in the spotlight, announced that Minutemen would be present to show Americans that true Americanism is still present in these dark times and to protect American citizens from the Old Democrats and Socialists. While all sides have been criticized for their behavior and possible motives there is little doubt this will end badly."
ustates.86.a:0 "We will do what we can"

ustates.87.t:0 "Detroit Bloodbath"
ustates.87.d:0 "The March ended nearly as quickly as it began and, as expected, was a disaster. The SPA and Old Democrats are blaming one another for firing the first shot and it is uncertain which of the two started the outright fighting but regardless the Federal Government, Minutemen, Socialists and Old Democrats began fighting amongst each other once the rioting broke out between them and few could tell one another from each other. Eventually however it became clear that the SPA had too many supporters in the area and the other factions had to retreat. The country is quickly breaking down as the body count is well over 200 and the Federal Governments weakness has been utterly exposed and no side can rely on them to keep order against the others. On top of this the National Guard is being blamed in the papers for civilian deaths alongside the other factions, depending on which parties newsletter is doing the printing."
ustates.87.a:0 "Now what?"

ustates.88.t:0 "Compromise Fails!"
ustates.88.d:0 "It appears we were too cocky. While our first few raids on militia headquarters went off without a hitch we failed when attempting to arrest a group of Minutemen in Southern Missouri, resulting in a shootout that kill 34 men, 12 national guardmen and 22 minutemen. The ODP and SPA militants became even more paranoid we were planning to actually wipe them all out and have likewise fired back at our boys. Willam H. Murray, Bill Haywood and Huey Long can now finally agree on one thing; that we are not to be trusted. They have fled home to doubtlessly prepare a counter-attack before habeus corpus is likely suspended."

### Garner Path ###

ustates.91.t:0 "John N. Garner's Inauguration"
ustates.91.d:0 "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Garner was quoted as saying 'We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.' On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893. Garner enters the White House surrounded by hostile AFP and SPA Senators as well as wary Republicans, though he has assured the public that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
ustates.91.a:0 "God Save America"

ustates.9100.t:0 "President Announces Hard Line"
ustates.9100.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destabilize America. He has ordered all rioters in the Steel Belt to return home and likewise for all AFP minutemen and ODP militants to stand down before military action is taken. All SPA, AFP and ODP Senators walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
ustates.9100.a:0 "We will win"

ustates.9101.t:0 "J. Edgar Hoover's Proposal"
ustates.9101.d:0 "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [USA.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP, SPA, and ODP can become more organized. A prosecution of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it is centered around his personality. A prosecution of Bill Haywood, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. Putting William Murray in prison would certainly create doubt among his supporters, and perhaps end the ODP threat entirely. There are also reasons to pursue D.C. Stephenson or Earl Browder, less powerful members of their respective factions, but still important figures we could find something on. This would de-legitimize the faction we decide to go after, but it may not be enough to end the crisis. Still, if the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."

ustates.9103.t:0 "Military Action Prepared!"
ustates.9103.d:0 "Our military is prepared to defend the Republic from the radicals! The only question now is where to use it? Anti-radicals have suggested using the bulk of the military to occupy the syndicalist occupied territory that is still striking while the cabinet would like to spread out the forces more and occupy all three radical factions. George Marshall however would like to split the difference, placing most of our military in the Steel Belt while using counter-espionage in other territories to prevent an immediate revolt, though he warns this will only buy time as they are likely already announcing a revolt against the President's hardline and out of fear that Garner will come after them once the SPA is finished."

ustates.9105.t:0 "Dealing with the Steel Belt"
ustates.9105.d:0 "The SPA's attacks have slowed with our increase of troops damaging their efforts and leading to counter attacks on their militia headquarters under MacArthur and Eisenhower. However while the Red Militias have weakened and the government has gained legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens of the Steel Belt the workers have not yet been won over to our side, with many still refusing to work even if they are not outright SPA members. Hardliners such as Alvin M. Owlsey and Harry F. Byrd have been encouraged by our recent success and are pushing for us to finish the job by cracking down on the rest of the strikers and unions so that industry may hire new workers or they learn not to engage in such behavior. However Vice President Al Smith and other cabinet members are pushing for us to cut a deal with industry leaders to raise wages in return for protection from the militias noting that most of these workers are not natural militants if they were treated fairly and SPA support can be undercut in the process."

With entire platoons of National Guardsmen being overrun, guerilla attacks, larger riots and barriers being set up by the Red Militia in the streets of Chicago and Detroit we are forced to fallback to Washington DC. MacArthur is furious at the situation feeling victory could have been attained if the government hadn't fumbled the situation and the radicals will soon be on our doorstep due to Garner and his adivsors.

While it is unclear why Hoover kept this information to himself, he may have been hedging his bets to use this information as a bargaining chip.

ustates.9108.a:0 "Arrest Stephenson"

ustates.92.t:0 "The Austerity Bill"
ustates.92.d:0 "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards non-army based military spending and federal spending on construction projects. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression and attempted to boost market confidence by stating that the cut was partially due to the belief of his cabinet that the Depression was already coming to an end, and it was met with mostly skepticism and jeers from radical Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country by reinvigorating private investor confidence in the nation."
ustates.92.a:0 "Believe in America"

ustates.93.t:0 "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
ustates.93.d:0 "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a Louisiana speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist and reactionary rhetoric. Long said he would be directing the AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."

ustates.94.t:0 "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
ustates.94.d:0 "A demonstration in Washington D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Bill Haywood condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."
ustates.94.a:0 "Fanatical Scum!"

ustates.95.t:0 "General Strike Spreads"
ustates.95.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with rival militias. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
ustates.95.a:0 "Damned Fools!"

ustates.96.t:0 "Austerity Bill Voting Commences"
ustates.96.d:0 "Voting on the Emergency Austerity Measures bill began in Congress today, though early indications were not good. While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and while there are enough Republican and ODP Senators remaining on the fence, passage may prove unlikely without intervention. It is possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans and hope that enough Old Democrats break party line to vote for the bill. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"
ustates.96.a:0 "Appeal to other parties"

ustates.97.t:0 "Violence in Atlanta"
ustates.97.d:0 "Our counter-espionage and generally lightly-equipped forces in the South can no longer hold the region, despite many ODP members being initially satisifed with our occupation of the Steel Belt. With our agents being increasingly rooted out in NDWL organizations, they have finally retaliated by assassinating several FBI agents at their supposed "Safehouse" in Atanta, with White Leaguers opening fire from outside with shotguns. The NDWL is openly organizing against us, aware that we are coming for them and that our forces are still stuck in the Steel Belt."
ustates.97.a:0 "Traitors!"

ustates.98.t:0 "Austerity Bill Fails"

ustates.98.a:0 "Congress isn't worth piss anyways"

ustates.99.t:0 "Steel Belt Pacified!"
ustates.99.d:0 "With businesses in the Steel Belt agreeing to pay workers more and the army continuing to push back the Red Militias an increasing number of workers are viewing the Federal government as a more stable source of protection and income than the SPA. With it becoming clear that outright revolt will not succeed many SPA congressional leaders are listening to their more moderate wing and calling for calmness and an end to hostilities saying that better conditions can still be negotiated for through Congress."

ustates.100.t:0 "Third Parties Stumble"
ustates.100.d:0 "With the Democratic Party reabsorbing much of their old constiuencies among the Old Democrats, Southern AFP and even part of the Steel Belt that is becoming connected to the Democratic-party based unions and political machines the third parties that once challanged the Democrats and Republicans at the national level have become state-level parties instead, with Long's AFP being the most succesful but becoming relegated to running Louisiana and some assorted populist districts, his influence in Congress remaining only due to his willingness to work with progressives. However, the Progressives are increasingly being reabsorbed by the Republicans with George Norris, Hiram Johnson, and others returning to the Republican fold. Meanwhile the Old Democrats and White Leagues are still present in the American Southeast but most are more or less either rejoining the Democrats or becoming relegated to the fringe elsewhere. SPA no longer commands the power it once did with its revolutionary tendencies being discredited and it's unlikely they will hold any seat higher than the House of Representatives for long. It seems the stability of the two-party system has been preserved at the national level and the radicals have been displaced."

Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. Garner's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent. Garner himself is forced to choose between fleeing the nation or accepting his new role as a President-in-name only."

Garner was fortunate that with the sudden downfall of D.C. Stephenson the ODP's party discipline has weakened to the point that ODP congressmen such as Philip H. Stoll were willing to cross the aisle to make overtures to more traditional democrats and distance themselves somewhat from more militant White Leaguers."

ustates.107.t:0 "Norris Proposes Intervention"
ustates.107.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Norris has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a comission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. The Progressives believe this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared support for the bill despite believing it does not go far enough and believing it may be too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. The ODP meanwhile claim this is just another way for federal liberals to empower wealthy cosmopolitans and progressives in D.C. at the expense of Americans, calling for banks to be broken up and handed to native citizens on the state level. We may have to modify the bill to get more of the AFP and SPA on board, of which Quentin Roosevelt has proposed to retroactively investigate those who may have commited fraud and charge them to show we are the not the same people as the corrupt elements of the business community who caused this crash as well as our committment to justice."

Haywood on the other hand had more radical demands, demanding support for workers coops, urban spending, the release of a laundry list of SPA activists who were arrested for various relatively petty crimes and government protection of unions. He went on to state the SPA should be given greater leniancy over the region, at which point Long demanded the same for the AFP and that he would like to be involved in passing the relief bill."

They are currently stalling as much as possible in Congress and the National Democratic White League under Joseph Simmons has printed newsletters decrying us.

Both Simmons and Evans will likely stand trial soon. Meanwhile NDWL numbers are collapsing since the Stephenson scandal, with this recent action only accelerating its collapse.

### Victory in the civil war

ustates.116.t:0 "MacArthur's Power"
ustates.116.d:0 "With our victory in the civil war, a question must be decided upon. Should Douglas MacArthur resign as President and ensure a peaceful transition of power or should he remain in control to protect America? Hard liners within MacArthur's clique insist that the US will fall back into civil war without him, while Republicans and some Democrats claim MacArthur would be a tyrant to stay."

ustates.118.t:0 "Malice or Charity"
ustates.118.d:0 "The question of what to do with those that fought against the government has to be decided. Shall we offer clemency to those that fought against the government and try and rehabilitate them back into society or shall they be punished for their actions against America?"
ustates.118.a:0 "Charity."
ustates.118.b:0 "Malice."

ustates.119.t:0 "The fate of the Electoral College"
ustates.119.d:0 "As we work to strengthen democracy following the civil war, the question of the Electoral College has been brought up. Many are calling for the end to first-past-the-post voting for state electors. This would be replaced by a more simple national popular voting system. A majority of Congress believes that we should keep FPTP around as a safeguard against radicalism in the future. What should we do?"
ustates.119.a:0 "We shall adopt Popular Vote."
ustates.119.b:0 "The Electoral College Stays!"

ustates.120.t:0 "National Rehabilitation"
ustates.120.d:0 "While we root out those that continue to still fight on for their treasonous cause, the question has come before MacArthur about what to do to those that have laid down their arms. Some of his advisers are suggesting clemency others suggest they must be imprisoned for their actions. What shall the commander in chief choose?"
ustates.120.a:0 "Down with the Traitors."
ustates.120.b:0 "We have spilt enough blood."

ustates.121.t:0 "Reconcile with Washington?"
ustates.121.d:0 "The Tyrant MacArthur has done the unthinkable and has stepped down from power. Thus a debate has arisen about if we should reunite and make America whole. Many believe that even though MacArthur has stepped down from power, he still has control and that he won't hesitate to re-assume power should politics don't go his way."
ustates.121.a:0 "Let us reunite with Washington(Game Over)"
ustates.121.b:0 "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

ustates.122.t:0 "America is reunited!"
ustates.122.d:0 "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
ustates.122.a:0 "From Sea to shining Sea!"

ustates.123.t:0 "No Reconciliation"
ustates.123.d:0 "Since MacArthur stepped down many wondered if the country would be whole again. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they denounced Congress as just being a pawn of MacArthur who they still regard as a tyrant despite the fact he saved the country."
ustates.123.a:0 "America one day shall be reunited."

ustates.124.t:0 "America is Reunited"
ustates.124.d:0 "At long last America has been reunited. We stretch once again from sea to shining sea. The traitors to the country have been destroyed and the stars and stripes now fly proudly from coast to coast knowing that liberty is secured for all."
ustates.124.a:0 "A more perfect union."

ustates.125.t:0 "The National Labor Relations Board"
ustates.125.d:0 "With the civil war over and reconstruction now under way, the question of trade unions have been brought up. Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a national labor relations board. This board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang. Others however, regard all trade unions as traitors to the country and should be outlawed toggether. Congress has decided to...?"
ustates.125.a:0 "Accept the AFL and KoL into the NLRB."
ustates.125.b:0 "Outlaw all Unions regardless of loyalty."

ustates.126.t:0 "Army is slow to desegregate"
ustates.126.d:0 "After the President signed a law to desegregate the Armed Forces, it seems that it is taking more time then expected to fully desegregate. There are still black only and white only regiments and several officers are determined to keep things separate. Despite the slowness, things are improving as more and more units are desegregating. Still, Progress is slow."
ustates.126.a:0 "Desegregation shall still happen."

ustates.127.t:0 "The Red Scare"
ustates.127.d.macarthur:0 "Since MacArthur has taken power he has begun a campaign against socialism, anarchism, and syndicalism. They are after all the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must know the role that they played in the conflict and as such as the so-called 'red scare' begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
ustates.127.d.elected:0 "Since the election of [USA.GetLeader], the government of the United States has begun a campaign against socialist of all stripes. They were one of the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must understand their role. Moreover socialists and syndicalists must not allow their subversion to survive and as such as the so-called 'red scare' begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
ustates.127.a:0 "Better Dead than Red."

ustates.128.t:0 "Lavender Scare"
ustates.128.d:0 "With the so-called Red Scare under way, [USA.GetLeader] has passed Executive Order 10450 that broadened the definition of a national security risk to include 'Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion.'. This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocracy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, has long been rumoured to be in the closet with his secretary Clyde Tolson. As Director of the most important intelligence agency, Hoover is of course beyond investigation. Even if we were to, J. Edgar probably has much more dirt on us than we have on him."
ustates.128.a:0 "Let's not investigate J. Edgar Hoover."

ustates.1280.t:0 "Angered Congressmen"
ustates.1280.d:0 "Some Congressmen have become upset by our decision not to return power to them, notably Matthew M. Neely whom has long led the faction anywhere from ambigious to mildly hostile on the question of MacArthur, though they still allowed him to take charge. We could undermine his faction by bribing their members or, perhaps, simply arresting and questioning them?"

ustates.1280.c:0 "Both"
ustates.1280.e:0 "Neither, we're fine"

ustates.1281.t:0 "Navy Demands!"
ustates.1281.d:0 "The Navy is already demanding additional funding, autonomy, and staffing in return for their loyalty to MacArthur. The rivalry between the army and navy has long been known and has only grown since MacArthur took power. William D. Leahy is in particular disgusted by the decision of MacArthur to keep power, and on top of the existing demands wants for MacArthur to keep out of Congressional elections. Meanwhile, Ernest King is reported to be filled with rage at MacArthur's constant attempts to exercise more control (and general army superiority) over the Navy. While army insiders hate the demands Leahy has made, we may have to accept for the moment to keep these wings of the admirality in-line."
ustates.1281.a:0 "Agree... for now"
ustates.1281.b:0 "NO"

ustates.1282.t:0 "Ernest J. King's offer"
ustates.1282.d:0 "Admiral Ernest J. King, while loyal enough to MacArthur thus far, clearly has his own vision for how the country should be run. Worse, he tires of the relentless orders coming from MacArthur's office, seeing him as no better than himself, and believing the army has no right to control the navy. Though King's criticisms are not the same as Leahy's, it seems that both men are threats that will need to be dealt with if we are to have a stable regime and ultimately win the war. Taking note of Leahy's antagonism towards MacArthur, King has come to MacArthur with an offer to take the whole of the navy in a bid to make it run more efficiently, while also guaranteeing some sort of stability in this branch. However, other admirals warn that King is an even less trustworthy advisor than Leahy, and that he seeks his own gain. J. Edgar Hoover has offered to be the one to find a way to get rid of Admiral King if need be, but given his talent, we cannot indulge this offer. We must decide: will we accept King's offer or risk the fallout of denying him?"
ustates.1282.a:0 "Back King"
ustates.1282.b:0 "Ask Congress to help bring these admirals to heel!"
ustates.1282.c:0 "No, we're fine as is"

ustates.1283.t:0 "Legion members win elections"
ustates.1283.d:0 "Increasingly members of the American Legion running for Congress are winning seats with an impressively large percent of the vote when running against critics of MacArthur. Of course, this has lead to criticisms that the American Legion is fixing elections on the current regimes behalf and that the Legion members whom stand outside election boxes are acting against democracy. Naturally, the American Legion is asking for our support by having us undermine these newspapers through fines and jailing for their lies."
ustates.1283.a:0 "Yes, Protect the Legion"
ustates.1283.b:0 "We'll Stay out of this one"

ustates.1284.t:0 "War Propaganda League Requests Radio America!"
ustates.1284.d:0 "A new subdivision of the War Department, the War Propaganda League, is requesting funding to create Radio America, a program that will allow them to reach out to citizens in a more personal manner in support of the USA, especially in regards to the threats the anarchists, Longists and Old Democrats show. They have taken notice of a young actor who has been particularly vocal in his support of the Federalist cause named Ronald Reagan, whom has been selected to host the program if it is approved given the story of him moving East in support of us is in-and-of-itself making the rounds. With our shortage of support among much of the public outside of D.C. itself, it would certainly help."
ustates.1284.a:0 "Back the project"
ustates.1284.b:0 "Seems like a waste of money"

ustates.1285.t:0 "Report on the Combined Syndicates"
ustates.1285.d:0 "Listen citizens, there is a new report from the Combined Syndicates and let me warn you, it's not good. Apparently the anarchists and communists and other red fanatics have already undergone the process of claiming the property of the Americans unlucky enough to live in their territory. Reed, Foster, Browder and the other high priests of the syndicalist cause believe that by robbing their citizens of freedom they are paving the way for a glorious new future, as we've seen in the case of the equally tyrannical Commune of France and Union of Britain, which have both exiled their own citizens and do no allow a word spoken against their regimes. Now, I hope I don't have to tell you how lucky we are to live in such a territory with the protection of the Red, White and Blue but just in case, we are lucky indeed. So next time you go to your home, or your job, remember what could happen if the Combined Syndicalists win, and what you can do to prevent that! That's Radio America from Ronald Reagan, signing out."
ustates.1285.a:0 "A Fine Message"

ustates.1286.t:0 "Report on the Old Democrats"
ustates.1286.d:0 "Hello citizens, I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news for you. It appears that the Old Democrats in the deep south are terrorizing their own citizens, as per usual, and have empowered the terroristic Black Legion to commit crimes against everyday citizens, black and white. Apparently, raids on Black Territory in the South by the KKK are commonplace, where they commit all manner of unholy behavior. Thankfully with the might of the Congress and the General on our side we can not only not suffer as they are, but liberate them as well. Remember that everytime you aid MacArthur, you aid America. Thank you."

ustates.1287.t:0 "Pennsylvania is ours!"
ustates.1287.d:0 "Good news my fellow Americans! We have taken the former territories of the Combined Syndicates which is properly known as the state of Pennsylvania. Average Americans whom fretted about being attacked by the Red Guard or wondered if they would ever see their belongings or property again, have been restored. Militants who carried out their crazed 'vigilante justice' have been captured so they can face property justice. And their leaders are running scared. Soon America will be properly one."

ustates.1288.t:0 "Huey Long falls!"
ustates.1288.d:0 "The great charlatan known as Huey Long has finally lost! Is it any shock that such a character could fail to properly govern a citizenry as naturally honest and freedom-loving as the American People? His so-called Minutemen are soon to be relics of the past, where they belong so the true Minutemen of 1776 can be properly remembered and continue to live on in the American Spirit. Likewise, his socialism dressed up as something else will soon likewise be forgotten. While it may not seem it, his fall is yet another step towards a total victory for America."
ustates.1288.a:0 "God Bless Radio America"

ustates.1289.t:0 "Congress hails MacArthur!"
ustates.1289.d:0 "With his declaration of America being safe from the radicals, General MacArthur has said that he is formally stepping down from his place of executive power alongside other members of the military. Congress burst into applause and he has been praised as the 'American Cinncinatus' whom saved the United States from the various extremists who would've destroyed it. Already he is being considered for the rank of Six Star General, an honor not bestowed since Washington himself."

ustates.1292.t:0 "Leahy Leads Democratic Forces to Coup the Government"
ustates.1292.d:0 "Though Admiral William D. Leahy initially gave his implicit support to the MacArthur regime, it quickly became apparent that the two would have disagreements over MacArthur's treatment of Congress and the rest of Washington. Leahy, believing that the military should largely stay out of politics, has protested MacArthur's restrictions on Congress, arguing that they endanger the very principles the country was founded on. Recently, in what appears to have been a watershed moment, MacArthur announced that the military would take a role in congressional elections as well, causing Leahy to lead disgruntled politicians, admirals, and even some army men to coup the government. \n\nDouglas MacArthur was arrested during the coup, and with the coup being almost bloodless, it seems like an excellent outcome for what was certainly an extremely risky maneuver. However, Leahy must now contend with the rest of the United States; Bradley and Eisenhower in the WCC, perhaps sympathizing with Leahy's cause but unlikely to approve of a navy dominant over the army, the pretender regime on the West Coast, and the various extremist factions that threaten to tear this nation apart. Regardless, Leahy has the support of much of Washington, and it seems that even Ernest King has agreed to fall in line behind Leahy's leadership, viewing him as one of the only men he would ever follow. What will happen next is yet to be seen..."

ustates.1293.t:0 "King Takes Control in Washington!"
ustates.1293.d:0 "When Douglas MacArthur took over the government, Admiral Ernest King was one of the original supporters of the decision, viewing it as a necessity to save the country from certain destruction. Since then though, King has chafed under the command of MacArthur, viewing his constant dismissals of the navy as disrespectful and a danger to the war effort. Though MacArthur ultimately relented and gave King control over the navy recently, it seems the move was only an attempt by King to gain more power, and it was ultimately successful. King, with the support of Leahy and several disgruntled generals, led a coup in Washington today, arresting Douglas MacArthur and taking the entirety of the government within a few short hours. \n\nNow, King must face the war MacArthur started, and though little time has passed, it already seems that King will face significant roadblocks to a victory in the Civil War. The WCC, led by Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, is unlikely to give much support to King, viewing him as merely another iteration of MacArthur, and since he wears a navy uniform rather than an army one, they are even less likely to be supportive. Meanwhile, the Pacific is sure to see this coup as merely another justification for the existence of their own regime, arguing that true stability exists in the West. Beyond these groups, the various extremists that run roughshot over our rightful territory must also be dealt with. The future is unclear..."

ustates.1294.d:0 "Though we were successful in detaining Douglas MacArthur, many of his close lieutenants eluded us on the day of the coup, and now they have fled west to the Western Command Center. Admiral King has denounced these men, arguing that their loyalty was to a man and not the country, and that perhaps they are of better use in the West. What no side has mentioned is that this is only the latest development in the seemingly growing rivalry between the army and navy, now taking place in the form of the Western Command Center against the United States government. Dwight Eisenhower has been said to take a personal disliking to King, viewing his arrogance and aggression as unbecoming of an American admiral. For his part, Omar Bradley has largely remained quiet on King, but it seems that neither Eisenhower nor Bradley has a favorable opinion of the man in Washington. Never before in U.S. history has the divide between army and navy been so apparent, and it is sure to be a cause for tension for years after the war unless we act quickly..."

The bill, as proposed by a minority coalition of Social Democrats within the Republicans and Democrats has very little chance of succeeding. It is claimed by the supporters that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again.

Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist public relations campaign.

ustates.190.d.progs:0 "It has been almost four years since George Norris took office, and though he began his term residing over a collapsing nation, he was able to act quickly and prevent a Civil War from breaking out. While the Norris-Roosevelt ticket is wildly popular among the Progressive base, his re-election is not guaranteed. Four years ago, after tense negotiations, Huey Long and Jack Reed endorsed the Progressive Party, and they may hold the key to it's re-election chances. Securing their support will be vital. Meanwhile, it appears that ideological struggles will characterize this year's Democratic and Republican primaries. Those who agree with many of Norris's reforms argue that embracing some of them is the only way to beat the Progressives in November, while those who vehemently oppose the Square Deal argue that making their own policy arguments is the only way to win. Even if the parties haven't decided how to run against Norris, it is clear he has made an enemy in the media. Whatever Norris does, it seems that the newspapers cover it unfavorably, and this may pose a problem for him in the election. Regardless though, both Norris and Roosevelt have signaled their enthusiasm for continuing their work in office, and hope to usher the U.S. into a new age of prosperity."
ustates.190.d.landon:0 "In just a few years, President Alf Landon has reversed the dismal fortunes of the Republican Party handed to him by Herbert Hoover. The Landon Plan has differed from Hoover's approach mainly in that Landon blames tariffs for America's economic woes, and hence has pursued a more free-trade approach. While this plan, in addition to domestic stimulus programs, has largely helped Americans recover, there is no guarantee the Republicans will be re-elected in November. It is a rare thing in American politics to see one party be elected four consecutive times, and the country has certainly changed from the days of Hoover's first term. The insurgent third parties that ran in 1936 have largely dissipated, yet their leaders are still influential, and they have focused their critiques on the impact of Landon's trade policies. Long and Reed have lambasted Landon for policies they insist have hurt farmers and workers at the benefit of corporations, while Murray has argued that Landon's policies only benefit the cosmopolitan elite class. Meanwhile, while the Progressives have largely echoed the critiques of Reed and Long, the Democrats have crafted their own message, painting Landon as an out-of-touch Easern elitist who couldn't hope to understand the plight of the everyday American. The results of such criticisms are yet to be seen, but it is clear that Landon may have a tough season ahead of him."
ustates.190.d.curtis:0 "President Charles Curtis has successfully administered the country's recovery during his challenging term in office, and now he looks to re-election. Curtis's "Work Sharing Plan", along with his stimulus programs, have been just what America's economy has needed to get back on track. His success has made him popular, but Curtis faces hurdles in the way of his re-election. For one thing, the insurgent parties from the last election have largely disappeared, but their leaders have not. Reed and Long have criticized Curtis's programs for being pro-worker on  the surface only, and representing business interests in truth. Meanwhile, Murray has characterized Curtis's reforms as a capitulation to syndicalists. The mainstream Democrats, after years of failure on the national level, are experincing a struggle for the soul of the party, with reform-minded liberals hoping to take control of the party and the still-mighty conservatives hoping to retain power. Regardless of their faction though, nearly all Democrats have criticized Curtis's programs as tyrannical and violating the rights of states and the terms agreed on in the "Home Rule Negotiations". Curtis has a difficult election ahead of him, but with any luck, he will lead the party to victory once again."
ustates.190.d.garner:0 "John Nance Garner has beaten every political enemy he has faced in his first term in office, but new ones have risen to challenge his power. Largely seen as a humble and unassuming man, Garner is a political intriguer in reality, often making backroom deals to achieve his goals. His program of "Austerity through the Storm" as well as the political strategy of repressing the leftist radicals of the North and Midwest has been successful, and order has finally been restored to a battered nation. However, the battle is not yet over for Garner. If he wants to win re-election, he will have to deal with leaders of the now-defunct ODP party, who still hold sway over millions of voters and who are bitter at their treatment in recent years. At the same time, many ODP voters have switched over to the Democratic Party, where they have traditionally been, and even much of the ODP leadership has complimented Garner's emphasis on rooting out syndicalism in the country. Still, there is much ground to be covered before official reunification of the two Democratic factions is achieved. In the meantime, while Reed and Long have been silenced, the Republican Party is as strong as ever, marshaling the outrage of northerners and coastal elites against what they see as a dirty, simple, and crass man who is unfit to be president. It is this hatred by northeastern elites in particular that may trouble Garner in his re-election, and the Catholics who voted for him in the last election may be less excited for his second term after his adoption of some ODP anti-Catholic rhetoric. Further, the party machines in that region of the country, dissatisfied by Garner's lack of civility and his sheer conservatism, will surely drag their feet in mobilizing urban Democrats. Many of these elites look down on Garner, and already predict a Republican victory in November. For his part, Garner is determined to show the world just how wrong they are, and he is confident the party can achieve victory. Time will tell whether he is correct, however..."

George Norris and Quentin Roosevelt were decided on as a compromise ticket, a move that most congressmen saw as magnanimous, as they actually despised Norris's platform. The decision was only made in an effort to appease Longists, Syndicalists, and Progressives themselves, whose combined vote tally surpassed that of the Republicans and Democrats. However, the decision to make him president was not received well by the nation's right-wing, particularly the ODP and the South as a whole. The Democratic Party, after years of losses and ineffectiveness, has lost most of its old base, who have flocked to the ODP instead. Even worse, William Murray has convinced millions nationwide to join him in forming a new "National People's Party". With its new support, the party poses a true threat to Norris's re-election chances.

In his first term, Garner has been able to successfully defuse the national tension before armed conflict broke out, and also save the economy from ruin. However, he has not been as successful on the political front. The House's decision to select another president was most bitterly denounced by Huey Long and Jack Reed. The two have begun their own party in the time since the election, calling it the Populist Party in a nod to the old party of the same name.

Both Reed and Long have put forward their preferences for who the first speaker should be, but the decision has still not been made, and a last minute pick will have to suffice. It would be best to have the first be a good orator  but not a firebrand so as to not take the wind out of the sails of those to follow, and two options have been pushed from each side. \n\nReed originally pushed for Eugene Dennis to give the first speech, but this was met with firm resistance from the anti-socialists within the Longist camp. His next offer was William Green, the more moderate union leader, who would be also be a more satisfying choice for the Long camp, though Green's rival John L. Lewis was seen to leave the convention in a fury after the name was suggested. \n\nFrom the Longist camp, the first suggestion was Robert LaFollette Jr., brother of Wisconsin Governor Philip LaFollette. Off the back of a number of disputes with his brother, and his appointment as the administrator of  "Share our Wealth" in the Great Lakes region, "Young Bob" has stepped out of Philip’s shadow to become the champion of a distinctly Mid-Western brand of Longism. Given these credentials, few were surprised when Reed strongly opposed giving the floor to LaFollette Jr. What did come as a shock was his suggestion that perhaps Philip LaFollette should speak instead. While Governor LaFollette is no friend of Reed, he was also once considered a rival for Long in dominating the hearts and minds of much of Middle America, and as such, he is likely to be tepid in his support of the Longist wing of the party. \n\nAs the crowd continues to grow wilder, the moment has now come to decide which of these four men will open the convention."

It would be best to have the first be a good orator, but not a firebrand, so as to not take the wind out of the sails of those to follow, and two options have been pushed from each side. \n\nLindbergh originally pushed for his ally, famous industrialist Henry Ford, to give the first speech, but this was met with strong opposition from the populists in Murray’s camp. His next offer was William Randolph Hearst Jr., largely due to his father’s contributions in bringing the NPP to the attention of the American public. \n\nFrom Murray’s camp, the initial nomination was Gerald L. K. Smith, the radical Christian and populist. Though once aligned with Long’s AFP, Smith broke with them after their left-ward turn towards Norris, preferring to focus more firmly on campaigning for Christian and anti-Semitic positions. Smith has thus come to be aligned with the NPP, even if he has not fully been accepted by them. To no one’s surprise, Lindbergh and Hearst both voiced their firm opposition to giving the pulpit to a man who once coordinated Share Our Wealth efforts. Murray’s compromise suggestion was something of a surprise, as he nominated Samuel Green, Georgia native and one of the most prominent leaders of the much diminished Ku Klux Klan. Though the KKK remains mired in controversy, Green is a middle-class professional with a reputation for rejecting some of the flamboyancy of previous Klan leaders, a fact that has gained his embattled organization some support within respectable society.\n\nAs the crowd continues to grow wilder, the moment has now come to decide which of these four men will open the convention."

Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell. At the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."

ustates.303.t:0 "Winchester Project"
ustates.303.d:0 "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
ustates.303.a:0 "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy."

ustates.304.t:0 "The War and Peace Studies"
ustates.304.d:0 "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
ustates.304.a:0 "Constrained by diplomats no more."

ustates.305.t:0 "The White House and Xanadu"
ustates.305.d:0 "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."

ustates.306.t:0 "The New Normal in America"
ustates.306.d:0 "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."

The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."

ustates.308.d:0 "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."

ustates.309.d:0 "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
ustates.309.a:0 "Good boy Goddard."

ustates.310.t:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
ustates.310.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
ustates.310.a:0 "The breath goes now."

ustates.311.t:0 "Reich's Failed Explosion"
ustates.311.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
ustates.311.a:0 "Not our proudest moment."

ustates.312.t:0 "The Patriot Party?"
ustates.312.d:0 "With MacArthur holding onto power many allies such as Rockefeller, Kennan, Sutherland and the American Legion leadership is advising us to organize our supporters under a unified political party, rather than simply having known supporters of the military government. While it would take some getting used to, The Patriot Party would greatly aid in our efforts."

ustates.3120.t:0 "Courting Dissenting Generals"
ustates.3120.d:0 "Though most of our generals either agree with or have ignored our new junta system, but there are a few voices who have spoke up. Edwin F. Harding and Lloyd Fredendall, both of them men who were close to the traitor George Marshall, are the most prominent dissenters, and we should try to address their concerns. This could be done by a transfer of money or positions, or by giving them positions outside the Committee. What shall we do?"
ustates.3120.a:0 "Offer them bribes."
ustates.3120.b:0 "Grant them minor positions."

ustates.3121.t:0 "Bring King into the Committee?"
ustates.3121.d:0 "Ernest J. King is one of MacArthur's most loyal military officials, and his grip over the U.S. Navy should not be underestimated. Partly to reward his loyalty and partly to get the support of the navy, some of our advisors recommend that we allow King a spot in the Committee alongside the various generals that have seats. However, others argue for army purity within the Committee, and this could have benefits as well. Should we bring King into the fold?"
ustates.3121.a:0 "Give him a spot."

ustates.3122.t:0 "Republican Party Convention"
ustates.3122.d:0 "In the wake of MacArthur's near-dictatorship, Congress wants a candidate they can control in the White House. The best way they can see this being done is by choosing someone from among their own, who has considerable experience and will not rock the boat. An older, more malleable candidate would be preferred, if possible. For the Republicans, the party is looking to two men in particular. Bertrand Snell is fairly conservative for a Republican, and dislikes the policies of Hoover and Curtis, even though he agrees with their lissez-faire principles. John Taber has served as a New York representative for over ten years, and is fairly unexciting, which is exactly what congressional Republicans are looking for.

Carter Glass is an experienced senator from Virginia whose old age perhaps makes him unlikely for a two-term candidate, but a perfect one for a congressional restoration and return of security, especially given his conservatism. Sam Rayburn, who is a protege of former Democratic nominee John Nance Garner, has a long history in Congress, and has proven his loyalty to the party time and again.

The first nominee up for consideration is Malin Craig. Craig's high ranking status in the military and his loyal to the United States make him a popular choice with both MacArthur and the WCC generals. Further, his stated neutrality in the earlier tensions between the USA and WCC means both sides can see him as a potential ally within the committee.

In any case, they will surely be wary of working with a major party, and will demand concessions before any agreement is made. This will likely take the shape of a watered-down "Share the Wealth" program.

If we can solidify this constituency, we will have a certain advantage in the electoral college for years to come, given that the Red Belt states have high electoral college vote counts. Before we can be sure of their loyalty though, we should speak to some of their leaders.

While the voters themselves supported us as the best progressive option last election, the leadership has been reluctant to support us.

Instead, in their desire for victory they embraced many on the right of the AFP and the moderates drawn from what was once William Murray’s Old Democratic Party. The remaining stragglers have formed the Union Party, centered around Gerald L. K. Smith, Charles Coughlin and Francis Townsend. The party attempts to unite the hard right elements of Long’s AFP and Murray’s ODP with the goal of opposing both socialist and capitalist socio-economics with a bizarre agenda that combines radical nationalism and Christian social policy. The party has been constantly riven with infighting between leaders since its inception and as a result, many view the venture as being doomed to failure.\n\nNow, the Democrats and Republicans seem to have recognized that the victory of the 3rd Party Populists would have left them to weak to compete on their own electorally and joined forces.  Calling themselves the Democratic-Republicans in reference to the parties of both Jefferson and Tyler, the new party support state’s rights, a balanced budget, a return to the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine and are generally opposed to trade protectionism. While they cannot change the fact that the Populist Party were almost victorious in the election, they now have the resources and support to make sure they will have a good chance of maintaing their success in subsequent elections, and the old two-party arrangement seems to be forming once again."

ustates.3164.d.NPP:0 "The United States is generally accepted to have gone through four different party systems during its existence, in which one party or another was dominant. While some consider a fifth party system to have already started, it is undeniable that a new one is forming in the aftermath of the last election. In the wake of [USA.GETLeader]'s victory in the election and the negotiations that followed, the newly formed National People’s Party failed to take power. Now, as the Progressives take power, the political situation is one like never before. \n\nWith their right wing in shambles, the Democrat Party attempted to embrace its populist offshoots in the AFP, but its recent struggles left the  national organization so splintered and weakened that most of the Democrat Machines broke off piecemeal, promoting a mass desertion by the other elements of the party. With little choice left, the remaining members of the Democratic Party at last united with their old rivals in the GOP. Meanwhile, the hard-liners on the Left have re-grouped under the banner of a more radical SPA, now consisting of Totalist and Anarchist factions in a deeply uneasy alliance. The party has been constantly riven with infighting over leadership and ideology since its last political re-orientation and as a result, it is doubtful that the SPA will return to national prominence in the near future.\n\nShortly after the Democrats and Republicans reunited under one banner, the party was riven by its own internal conflict between the party’s left wing and a camp composed of Hooverites and ex-Democrats. The left-wing called for a move to re-embrace the GOP’s populistic roots, and following irreconcilable differences split from the party and united with the Progressives. The remainder of the party, still under the leadership of Hoover, has now rebranded itself as the party of small business and classical liberal principles. While they may bear the name GOP, the party is only a shadow of its former self, and seems destined to exist as a perennial third party going forward. \n\nFollowing a union with the leftist remnants of the Democrats and the Farmer-Labor party, the newly-dubbed Progressive Farmer-Labor party stands as a rejuvenated vehicle for progressive and populist ideals which promises to continue to fight for Norris’ vision for America. With the help of its new constituents and their political machines, the former Progressive party now represents a serious, if big tent, national opposition to the National People’s Party. While they cannot change the fact that the NPP were almost victorious in the election, they now have the resources and support to make sure they will have a good chance of maintaing their success in subsequent elections, and the old two-party arrangement seems to be forming once again."

In fact, far from helping him, they have done nothing but hamper him, denying funds for the navy and generally being a thorn in King's side. It was long past time that we dealt with these corrupt 'lawmakers' who have stayed past their welcome. After all, the preponderance of people whose real interest is in their own welfare as individuals, something inherent to democraies, as well as the belief of the common congressman that he knows it all, greatly inhibits our war effort. This ignorance, greed, and arrogance cannot be allowed to continue any further, and as such, it is time to decide our next move.

With the advent of the American Civil War and prepartions for a global conflict on both sides of the Atlantic, it is more important than ever that shipping lines be kept as safe as possible to guarantee the continuation of trade. Such protection, of course, cannot come without real strength in the sea, and this is strength that King is more than willing to offer to nations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, for a price. Some of our advisors are crying that this is no better than piracy, but King insists that we are merely making use of our resources to win the war. We could move forward with this plan and risk angering our neighbors, or we could reconsider. What shall we do?"

Despite these claims, their ships often end up in the other ends of the Atlantic Ocean, and now they are demanding that we pay them in resources or other means in exchange for what they call 'protection'. By protection, it seems that they are talking about themselves, and the barely concealed fact that these sailors are raiding the Ocean is one that that will go unchallenged so long as they choose to target weaker nations. However, perhaps we could stand up to this arrogant nation. Doing so would incur a cost, but perhaps it would be worthwhile to save face..."

Such a 'blank check' would give King permission to do whatever is necessary to extract the resources he argues are absolutely essential, though this largely concerns the construction of factories and dockyards. Given the tough position of the United States in the Civil War, it is less a question of whether Congress will accept and more a question of which proposal would be more likely to pass. Should we argue that dockyards are the most essential pieces of this war effort, or will we pursue a general industrial buildup?"

Alternatively, we could do away with the risk of Marshall’s siren song potentially not working, and instead directly offer the Pacifician Head of State, President [CAL.GetLeader] the highest position in the White House.

Likewise, with only a few Supreme Court justices still remaining both alive and credible, this would effectively hand the Supreme Court to the victor, and allow for appointees to occupied areas to be decided via an informal proportional representation depending on the results of the referendum.

The two main sides of this debate have boiled down to either allowing Congress to make the decision, or leaving it up to the American people to decide.

ustates.500.d:0 "With assurances made by President Hoover that, unlike in 1932, this time he will not veto the bill, Democratic Senator Robert Wagner and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner have re-introduced their unemployment relief legislation package. Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."
ustates.500.a:0 "We shall see"

ustates.501.t:0 "Long and Haywood Demand Changes"
ustates.501.d:0 "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Bill Haywood and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."
ustates.501.a:0 "Interesting"

ustates.502.t:0 "Senators Break Ranks"
ustates.502.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations, a number of establishment Senators have broken ranks over the coming vote on the Garner-Wagner Bill - most notably Robert Wagner, one of the bill's proposers, who says he will not vote for the bill unless protections for federal unemployment insurance are re-added. Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible. President Hoover will need to intervene in order to save the bill."

ustates.503.t:0 "Long and Haywood Furious"
ustates.503.d:0 "Both Huey Long's AFP and Bill Haywood's SPA have reacted with fury at President Hoover's endorsement of establishment Senators. They have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner Bill, claiming that the public is being deceived by a 'corrupt government which refuses to recognize the reality of America'. While the parties have both gained a considerable boost in support from their base, Democratic and Republican fortunes have improved somewhat, and there is a feeling that both have a better chance going into the next election... provided the bill actually passes."
ustates.503.a:0 "Let's hope it does!"

ustates.504.t:0 "Compromise with the AFP"
ustates.504.d:0 "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the America First Party, with numerous extra provisions included for farm relief and unemployment protection - though nowhere near as far as the AFP originally demanded. Even so, Huey Long has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Bill Haywood's SPA and a large number of Republican Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."

ustates.508.t:0 "The Garner-Wagner Bill Fails!"
ustates.508.d:0 "After an incredibly close vote in Congress, the Garner-Wagner bill failed to pass. While several groups are declaring personal victory, protests have broken out in various parts of the country. There will be no relief for the American worker, and many have declared the government to be corrupt and dysfunctional.

ustates.511.d:0 "There is growing concern that America is descending into a possible civil war, and that - despite all our efforts to maintain security - supporters of the AFP and the SPA simply have too much influence in some parts of the country. General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas. Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the AFP and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."
ustates.511.a:0 "New York City is of vital importance"

ustates.512.t:0 "The Hawking Plan"
ustates.512.d:0 "Junior Democratic Senator Thomas Hawking has introduced a bill which will see the relief efforts largely funded by taxing American corporations - in exchange for hefty tax considerations down the line, once the economy has recovered. This has caused considerably controversy in some corners, especially among AFP and SPA supporters. Others say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolils or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are AFP and SPA strongholds."

ustates.513.t:0 "The New Industrial Act"
ustates.513.d:0 "As an offshoot of the Hawking Plan, relief efforts will see new industrial growth in several vital areas - primarily in the military sector. Several of these new companies are planned for Denver, Colorado. At least one other area can be promoted, and the cabinet believes that putting them in depressed areas which are currently strongholds of the AFP or SPA may see their influence in those areas drastically weakened."

Both would mean a large number of jobs for the area, and would be a boon for our control over the region. The problem is that word of the contract has gotten out, and whichever city we *don't* choose will likely be enraged, giving strength to the AFP or the SPA in the region."

ustates.515.t:0 "America Demands War Debts"
ustates.515.d:0 "It came as a surprise to the Canadian government, but the ambassador from [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded that the Canadian government immediately begin repaying the war debts incurred by the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has, to an extent, avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the debt... not all at once, at least. Though the old United Kingdom was on its way to repayment, there was a tacit agreement after the British Revolution that the debts wouldn't continue to be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."
ustates.515.a:0 "Whatever the reason, we cannot do as they demand"

ustates.516.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
ustates.516.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to the demand with a flat refusal. The debt, they say, was never meant to be repaid until the Home Islands were retaken - as most was incurred by the United Kingdom, a government which is now in exile. Even so, their refusal has done its job and fired up the isolationist elements of the American government. President Hoover's government has the support it needs, at the cost of relations with the Canadians."
ustates.516.a:0 "So be it"

ustates.517.t:0 "Compromise with America?"
ustates.517.d:0 "There has been a break in the chilly relations with the American government since their demand for debt repayment. They have approached us with an offer: economic assistance now, and an agreement to increase trade with the Entente, in exchange for the rest of the debt being delayed until the Home Isles are retaken... which was, aides point out, the original deal to begin with. It might be a way to restore goodwill with our southern neighbors, and even help them, though some are suggesting that there's no point in shoveling our limited funds into a bottomless pit. America is lost, they say, and we should look to our own first."
ustates.517.a:0 "We agree to the compromise"
ustates.517.b:0 "They are on their own"

ustates.518.t:0 "Canada Agrees to Compromise"
ustates.518.d:0 "The Canadian government has reluctantly agreed to the compromise, giving us what repayment they can now and accepting the deferment until the Home Isles have been retaken. In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all. The main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the AFP and the SPA, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."
ustates.518.a:0 "We'll take what we can get"

ustates.519.t:0 "Canada Refuses the Compromise"
ustates.519.d:0 "The Canadian government has refused our offer of compromise, leading to economic sanctions applied by both sides. The chance of this escalating to war is slight, but the damage is done. We'll have to be satisfied with the gains we've made, and the increased revenue from the tarriffs."
ustates.519.a:0 "It was worth a try"

ustates.520.t:0 "Long Bans the SPA from Congress"
ustates.520.d:0 "In a fiery speech, President Long declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the SPA and its insidious influence over America. The ongoing New Year's Strike is its doing, and it is America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the SPA from Congress, and named the Minutemen as acting with emergency invested authority as executors of the president's will. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the SPA, many more are alarmed by President Long's use of executive power."
ustates.520.a:0 "So must it be"

ustates.521.t:0 "Haywood Bans America First from Congress"
ustates.521.d:0 "In a fiery speech, President Haywood declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the America First Party and its insidious influence over America. So long as the Minutemen milita run rampant, attacking strikers and innocent Americans alike, it will be America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the AFP from Congress, and called on the SPA milita to act as emergency reinforcement to government forces. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the Minutemen, many more are alarmed by President Haywood's use of executive power."

ustates.522.d:0 "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Minutemen and the America First Party, Bill Haywood has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organization which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Haywood has drawn a direct comparison between the Minutemen and the terrorist attacks that occurred on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The Minutemen are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
ustates.522.a:0 "Excellent!"

ustates.523.d:0 "Huey Long publicly denounced Haywood's executive order as being unconstitutional and an act meant to suppress opposition to his rule and pave the way for syndialist reforms in America. Long has organized large rallies and protests with the Minutemen there to keep the protesters safe from aggression. These highly reported-on protests have seen union strikers beaten by Minutemen without interference from the police, which calls into question Haywood's ability to protect Americans."
ustates.523.a:0 "Rely on the police to keep control"

ustates.524.t:0 "Police Forces Defy Haywood"
ustates.524.d:0 "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, and other cities scattered throughout the American South, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the AFP. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declare that they would not follow the Laws of 'Haywood the Tyrant'. Thus Haywood has called in the US Army to enforce his laws."

ustates.525.t:0 "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
ustates.525.d:0 "When government foces, bolstered by SPA milita, arrived in the American South to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by Minutemen and supporters of the AFP. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Americna South.

MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, Haywood was able to stay ahead of the general and has escaped to Chicago.

The ceasefire has held, after all - so do they desire peace? Our question has been answered with the arrival of an envoy from the Federal government. They wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Haywood, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"

It could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us. To repay him this way seems almost unthinkable."

Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin.

ustates.600.d:0 "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with no tanks at all and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."

A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. New carriers have been commissioned, but they are nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm on the horizon."

However, air development during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, spark conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganize as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield. With the High Command being undecided on the issue, the final decision has been sent to the War Department, where it has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense to decide on the matter."

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."

While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation. While the relations between MacArthur and navy have been bad for years, this is yet another sad example of how the inter-service rivalry has done nothing but grow in the last few years."

The manual consists of seven chapters – the first titled “General” followed by six chapters describing employment of antitank units in various scenarios (during the advance, halts, the development of the battle, defensive maneuvers, retrograde movements, and offensive operations). The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterized by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilized front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armored attacks. While officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."

In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the 'Armored Force Tentative Table of Organization' where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organization that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armored division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defense, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organization system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."

Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favorable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."

The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organizations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organizations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval.

From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books.

Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cementery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropiate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accomodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

Though separatist holdouts and radicals still harass the outskirts and underbelly of our newly purified and vindicated society and despite much of our policy and new edicts still being adjusted to by our citizens, the gaze of our keen-eyed and opportunistic advisors has once again begun to drift towards new avenues for prosperity and profit. \n\nAcross the stormy Atlantic lies a land still cloaked in an air of mystery and rife with opportunity unlike any other on Earth: Africa. From the serene and arid Mediterranen Coast, across the blistering Sahara, and down through the lands of the Congo to the tip of the Cape of Good Hope, every mile of the ‘Dark Continent’ is a veritable treasure trove of untapped and underutilized potential. The key culprit of this underutilization has been the absent-minded and short-sighted European imperial powers, who have long squandered the amazing bounty they lay claim to. \n\nHowever, we are fortunate enough that two independent African nations not only lie in our reach, but have previous ties with the former American government that stood before our righteous victory: South Africa, and our former colony Liberia. Our administration, given its newly restored stability and confidence, has sought to send a ‘diplomatic and economic overture’ to these free-standing African nations to stand as the new foothold of American interests within Africa. As always though, the masterminds behind this plan within our cabinet can not agree on how to best go about the situation, with three main proposals standing as plausible options. We can either send a generous, and cut-throat, trade delegation to their capitals, opening the door for American business to operate within Liberian and South African markets. Alternatively, many within our administration seek to take these trade talks one step further and offer them a seat within our newly established military alliance, paving the way for American military dominance on the Dark Continent. Finally, the warhawks within our group seek to skip the pleasantries entirely and demand that these weak and exposed governments fully subserviate themselves to our whim, for despite the wounds of our recent civil war, these nations pale in comparison to the might of the American warmachine.

To achieve this, he has sent an invitation to Bill Haywood to sit down in Chicago and negotiate a deal. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers.

Midway through the negotiations, word arrived that both Huey Long and (upon hearing of Long's request) William H. Murray have demanded to be present at the negotiations, despite our diplomats already telling them they would be seen after Haywood. Their presence will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing could incite the AFP and ODP to such a degree as to make success in Chicago worthless.

The AFP and ODP have stated that if we are to follow through on such an effort, we will have to do the same for them, and order MacArthur's military forces to stand down. Of course, Haywood nearly blew up the negotations by stating that pulling forces away from ODP strongholds would simply make it easier for the Red Guard to eventually overrun them, but is was a threat Murray simply chuckled at and invited him to try his best.

They must also cease their current strikes, riots, party recruitment in other areas of the country, and most of all, any overtly aggressive action against us. The Socialists are now currently transitioning Chicago and Detroit to semi-syndicalist systems where workers are universally unionized and own shares of production. While many within the cabinet do not like giving them control even to this degree, this level of decentralization has defused the radicals while allowing us to focus on the West and East, regions where the federal government is still most influential.

The members of the Socialist Party and radicals of the AFP, meanwhile, called the Bill too moderate. As such, it failed to pass through Congress in 1935. However with the shift in American politics, Senator Wagner has seen another chance to attempt ot pass this act, and along with this bill, he has brought forward what he is calling the House Act. This would allow subsidies to be paid from the US government to local public housing agencies to improve living conditions for the impoverished of this great nation.

McNary and the Progressive Caucus are calling for Hoover to listen to them and once more continue economic interventionism. Meanwhile, the liberals of the Republican and Democrat Party are advocating a similar stance to the progressives, but to a far lesser degree, along with attempting to maintain the balanced budget. Establishment Republicans like Charles Curtis are advising Hoover to embrace their idea of a 'Work Sharing Plan', which would compensate Americans for their hours lost via partial unemployment subsidy, and the last option on Hoover's Desk is performing austerity measures that the conservative Democrats and Republicans have pushed for.

With Hoover's decision to attempt to hold the Republican Party in the center of American politics, not leaning further Right or Left, the Progressive and Democratic Parties have filled those niches for the Party.

Next there is Samuel Green, representing the interests of the Ku Klux Klan and traditional nativist movements. Finally, there is Lothrop Stoddard, representing the new Scientific Racialist current that has been embraced by the elites of the East Coast. Each of these men has accrued considerable support for their agenda, and it looks like they and their supporters will all hold firm in maintaining the current deadlock if no outside force intervenes. \n\nFor this reason, the initiative is now on the [USA.GETLeader] administration to intervene by favoring one of the camps, giving their proposal the support needed to become official policy.

Japan is the only Great Power on the continent and has long wished to be seen as equal to its White counterparts compromising the rest of the Great Powers. For these and other reason, the policy of the United State for many years was to not explicitly restrict the inflow of Japanese immigrants, and instead to formulate a Gentleman's Agreement with the Empire, where they preserved their honor and in return they stopped Japanese from ever boarding ships to America. \n\nThis policy has failed. While the Japanese claim to be doing their best to prevent their citizens from immigrating to America, the population of Japanese in America has continued to grow precipitously with no sign of abating, especially with the grow of a significant population of 2nd generation Japanese-Americans. For this reason, there has long been a call to take additional action to prevent this growth,\"lest the West Coast be overrun\". At the same time, Japan's power is only growing, and consequently, there are many in our government who argue it would be better to accept the presence of the Japanese as a fait accompli, rather than run the risks of upsetting their homeland.

As a result, a significant section of the party will remain ironclad in their opposition to amending or remove Prohibition, regardless of what else we might say about liberty and personal freedom. \n\nWhile we may still be able to push through a repeal of Prohibition anyway, success might well prove to be a poisoned chalice thereafter.

An apology will not mean taking back those already sent to Liberia, where the state has pledged to deal with them. \n\nThis consideration is doubly useful, as the incident has now made it into the press, and become a political issue. Some of our more zealous supporters are outraged by this perceived insult and demand a flat rejection of the Liberian demands.

And with a broad base of support for the plan in America, it seems repatriation has never been more likely. \n\nNevertheless, we have encountered firm opposition from traditional Dixiecrats and other so-called moderate Segregationists. Citing the important role of Blacks in the Southern economy, and determined to preserve the present social order, they have proved a source of stiff opposition.

What we did not expect was the sheer extent to which the Southern Democrats would be linked to lynchings, voter suppression and any number of other crimes. For all their protestations of innocence or of circumstantial evidence, we knew the truth and we acted. \n\nNow, all that remains is to determine our course going forward.

Edgar Hoover's FBI risks become a state within a state, unbeholden to the political leadership of the nation. And while the work of the bureau in repressing the activities of the KKK must be acknowledged, it is a deeply worrying fact that this work began with an investigation that the Bureau's Chief had never obtained permission to undertake. \n\nFortuitously, we have recently come into information that has greatly strengthened our position. It was revealed to us via photographic evidence that the Director himself secretly engages in the most debauched and degenerate homophile behavior and has done so for some years. Recognizing the use of this information, we were able to obtain Hoover's resignation in return for handing over the compromising photos. With the ex-Director out of the way, we can now appoint a more loyal individual to his place, to spearhead our effort to once again subordinate the FBI to the federal government.

While their duty charges them with safeguarding the principles of the constitution from legislative encroachment without heed to political agenda or affiliation, the reality is much different. The court has long been a thoroughly partisan institution with a broadly anti-reformist agenda. Never has this been more true than now, as the justices have now made common cause with the rump opposition to delay, damage and dismantle our policy in any way possible. \n\nWith all other options and appeals exhausted, we will now have to take radical measures. If they want to play dirty, we'll be more than their match in that field. Two proposals have been made to this end. The first calls for the enlargment of the court to ensure a comfortable majority of supporters to rubber-stamp our legislation. The second calls for the same, and impressing on the existing justices the \"censure\" that will be imposed on wrong verdicts going forward. Which shall we choose?"

ustates.6010.desc:0 "The Electoral College was designed in a much different time in American history, as one of a number of mechanisms for balancing the interests of the founding states. However, the evolution of our nation and advances, both in urbanization and technology have made the college not only archaic, but actively counterproductive. Small states with smaller populations wield disproportionate electoral power, while the urban masses' votes are discounted in worth. In addition, the lack of punishment for faithless electors means that even when comparatively disenfranchised voters succeed in making their voice heard, their electors can ignore their wishes and accord their votes to another candidate, without fear of censure. \n\nAs a result, it has become abundantly clear that Electoral College reform is sorely needed. The only question left is whether we should take a moderate or more aggressive approach. The first would involve penalizing faithless electors nation-wide, with punishments up to and including imprisonment, while still retaining the college as a concession to smaller states. The second would involve the outright abolition of the college, even if angers those in the rural states, for the general furtherance of democracy in the nation. What is our decision?"

His death has shaken the nation's left to its core. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn spoke at the funeral saying 'History has a long-range perspective. It ultimately passes stern judgment on tyrants and vindicates those who fought, suffered, were imprisoned, and died for human freedom, against political oppression and economic slavery.'\n\nMany other leaders within various Union organizations also spoke at his funeral as well as leaders within the Socialist Party of America. The most noteworthy speech, though, was given by Jack Reed, who ended his speech with some of Haywood's quotes. He reminded the audience that 'If the workers are organized, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped. A strike is an incipient revolution. Many large revolutions have grown out of a small strike. Remember that you are fighting more than your own fight. You are fighting for the entire working class and you must stand together'.\n\nWith Haywood's sudden death, the Socialist Party and its many allies across the political spectrum have been taken aback, and the leadership of the SPA, CSA, IWW and ALF-CIO have called for a joint Congress, in hopes of finding a man to fill Haywood's incredibly large shoes. This Congress comes on the face of increasing calls of a turn to reform instead of revolution, due to the passing of the political crisis that marked the dawn of 1937."
nimatron.3.a:0 "The end of an era, or the beginning of one?"

nimatron.4.t:0 "Emergency Congress of the Socialist Party of America"
nimatron.4.d:0 "Today marks the end of the Emergency Party Congress called by the leadership of America's far-left following the death of their long time leader, William Haywood. The Congress itself was a simple enough affair, with delegates from across the nation, and even representatives from the both the Union of Britain and the Commune of France in attendance. As with most party congresses, the revelation of factional differences came all too early, although unlike most congresses, these factions were broadly split into two camps.\n\nThe first and largest of these factions, mostly belonging to the ranks of the AFL-CIO and the few progressives in attendance, called for a drastic change in policy. Instead of advocating and working directly for Revolution, these delegates fought for change to reformism, working within the system to reform capitalism. This faction agured the point by stating the obvious, the situation in America was much different then in 1936. By and large, the people, save for the most ardent revolutionaries, had calmed, and a sense of national brotherhood and normality had been restored. If the Party truly wished to see socialism, they must work with this new era, and drop the most overt calls for revolution. The second and smaller faction, made up of the CSA, Fosterites and the remnants of the CPUSA, rejected the call for reformism outright, naming those who supported it counter-revolutionaries. The faction simply called for the maintenance of the status quo, with some of the more radical members calling for a sudden uprising against the Old Order.\n\nAs the congress went on, it was clear that the reformists had it in the bag. Thus, the SPA's party program was officially changed, with all usage of revolutionary language being dropped in favor of a more reformist tone. As for the new chairman, John 'Jack' Reed was elected, seemingly as a compromise candidate. John Reed has long something of a pariah within the American Left. Be it his constant flip flopping between supporting Leninist communism or Communard-style Syndicalism, or his failed career as a journalist, it seems the only reason Reed was elected was due to his long time association with the revolutionary faction within the SPA's coalition. Regardless of the reason, the American Left has a new face, and a new program to boot."

USA_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
USA_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."

However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."

Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps in case of 'internal instability'. Regardless, he is widely considered one of the best planners of the United States Army and is widely respected within the General Staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
USA_HENRY_H_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."

In 1900, he changed his mind and decided to sign up to the Military Academy, where he graduated from West Point in 1904 as a second lieutenant. He was assigned as platoon leader of the 12th Battery of Mountain Artillery in Fort Douglas, but he would request a transfer to the Ordnance Department shortly after. Thanks to his studies in Minnesota, he managed to be appointed to the overseeing boards which developed new weapons for firearm companies, managing to reach the rank of First Lieutenant in 1909. He continued gaining relevance in the army thanks to his great leadership skills and technical expertise, reaching the rank of Captain in 1914 and taking part both in the Veracruz Expedition and the Pancho Villa Expedition with the 4th Field Artillery Regiment. He reached the rank of Major in 1917 and continued to take part in overseeing boards, experimenting with different types of artillery pieces as the Army began to prepare for possible involvement in the Weltkrieg that never came.\nHe was later assigned to the Army's Hawaiian department where he helped test new methods in coastal defence as well as spearheading the review of War Plan Orange, in the case of a Japanese attack of Hawaii. However, his involvement in what came to be known as the 'McNair Board' ended up drawing controversy from the Air Service Branch of the Army, which would later result in McNair presenting testimony against Billy Mitchell during a 1925 trial. He reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 1928 and entered the War College, graduating two years later and serving as a teacher in the U.S. Army Field Artillery School and as commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934. He reached the rank of Colonel in 1935 and became Executive Officer for the Army's Chief of Field Artillery. He finally reached the rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 by Major General Upton Birnie Jr.'s own recommendation to MacArthur."
USA_LLOYD_FREDENDALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 28, 1883, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lloyd Ralston Fredendall entered the United States Military Academy in 1905 thanks to his father's army connections and the nomination of Wyoming Senator Francis E. Warren. However, he did poorly and was dismissed from the academy in just one semester. His mother managed to convince the Senator to appoint him again the next year, but he dropped out, and while the Senator tried to appoint him for a third time the following year, he was rejected by the academy itself. Instead, Fredendall attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and undeterred by his experience in West Point, he took the officer's qualifying exam in 1906, achieving the highest grade of all the applicants. On February 13, 1907, he was finally commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant. Lloyd would then spend the rest of the decade working in several of the army's overseas schools, where he built a reputation of being an excellent teacher, trainer and administrator of troops. Like many other officers, he filled a series of staff and garrison duties in the United States during the twenties. He became both an instructor and student at the U.S. Army Infantry School, graduating in 1923 with distinction from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School and graduating from the U.S. Army War College. During the early thirties, he was posted at the Statistics Branch of Washington, as the Inspector General's Department and later as Executive officer of the Office of the Chief of Infantry. During these staff duties, he met and has held close relations with both George Marshall and Leslie McNair, both of which nominated Fredendall for the rank of Brigadier General, a request that was granted by MacArthur in late 1935. Since then, Fredendall has strengthened his relations with both McNair, Marshall and Marshall's protege, Dwight Eisenhower."

He enlisted in the United States Army in 1898 to fight the Spanish-American War with the 2nd United States Volunteer Infantry Regiment, reaching the rank of sergeant during the campaign. He re-enlisted for the Philippine-American War and joined the 12th Infantry Regiment, where he fought under the command of General Arthur MacArthur against the Insurrecto rebels. In 1901, he was finally commissioned as a second lieutenant and posted with the 30th Infantry Regiment in Marinduque until it was transferred back to the United States in 1903. While his unit did mostly garrison duties, Krueger attended the Infantry-Cavalry School and the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1904 and 1907 respectively. After a second tour in the Philippines, he was assigned to the Department of Languages until 1914, and with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, Krueger was offered a post as an observer with the German Army, but refused and was posted with the 10th Regiment of the National Guard. He was mobilized towards Mexico, where he took part in Pershing's Punitive Expedition. In late 1918, Krueger accepted to be an observer in Germany, where he was able to come into contact with the top-of-the-line German tactics, which Krueger would carry home when he returned to America in 1920. He was then posted to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he began teaching the basics of German Squad tactics to the eager staff, being promoted to major for his work. He'd continue perfecting his abilities, assisting the Army War College and graduating in 1922, and then leaving once more Germany, where he tried to foster good relations between the two countries' general staffs, but failing due to the hostile political climate of Germany towards the US. Krueger would then be assigned to the War Plans Division of the War Department General Staff, being one of the main engineers of the War Plan Blue, a hypothetical plan in case of another civil within the US. He was promoted to colonel in 1932, and later to Brigadier General for his new involvement in the War Plans Division."

In 1924 he was assigned as Executive Officer to the Chief of Cavalry, and in 1929 he graduated from the Army War College as a lieutenant colonel. In 1930 Van Voorhis was appointed to command the Army's first experimental mechanized force, receiving the promotion to brigadier general. With the experience he got from his experiment, he developed an organization system and new tactics for mechanized combat that has placed the United States along with other developed military powers like Germany. Since his appointment to the mechanized 7th Cavalry Brigade, Daniel has been working closely with Adna R.

For his outstanding performance, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant for the corps of engineers. After serving in several garrison posts, Lee was promoted to first lieutenant in 1912 and became an instructor for the Ohio National Guard. He'd choose to be sent to the Mexican border in late 1912 due to concerns that the Mexican Revolution might spill into American Borders. He conducted a series of topographical surveys in the American Pacific possessions, specifically Guam and Luzon in the Philippines, for which he was promoted to Captain in 1916. He was promoted to Major in 1920 and became Assistant Chief of Staff of the new Chicago-based VI Corps Area. He was posted as the District Engineer of Vicksburg, Mississippi when the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 happened, with Lee directing relief work and evacuations of towns and districts. After the passing of the Flood Control Act of 1928, Lee supervised works on the Red River, Ouachita River and Yazoo River and personally directed the construction of a new HQ and of the Waterways Experiment Station. After that, Lee attended the Army War College from September 1931 to June 1932 and became Assistant Commandant of the Army Industrial College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1934. Since then he has been the District Engineer of the Washington District and with the recent promotions, Lee earned his rank of Brigadier General, where his engineering skills may become vital for the staff."

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant for his higher education and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo after basic training. He didn't manage to see combat, as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899. He was then transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh for trying to rescue a fellow marine and earning a brevet promotion to captain. Afterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana wars, first to Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and to Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya and the capture of Coyotepe Hill.

He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension of the Hoover administration despite Butler’s criticism of Hoover. He remains however as one of the most influential and decorated officers of the United States Marine Corps, and his influence should not be taken lightly."

In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton has vocally opposed his colleague constantly. While his friend Eisenhower tends to mediate between the two, Patton has been forced by the general staff to remain as a lieutenant colonel despite having all the traits and qualifications of a brigadier general.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong racist views in public."

His first tour of duty was with the 15th Cavalry as part of the Army of Cuban Pacification, where he proved to be an extremelly competent horseman (which shortly earned him the nickname 'The Army's Finest Horseman'). He was next assigned to the Mounted Services School at Fort Riley, Kansas between 1907 and 1911, where he commanded the mounted detachment serving the students and staff of the Army War College. He was then sent to France to attend the French Cavalry School at Saumur in 1913, as tensions began rising in Europe. In 1914 he returned to America to teach in Fort Riley for a short time, but was redeployed to the 7th Cavalry Regiment in the Philippines. He was reassigned in 1915 to the Staff and Faculty at West Point as the Senior Cavalry Instructor in the Tactical Department, where he remained until 1919, when he became an instructor at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth.

After returning to the US, he was assigned to the Artillery Batteries near the Mexican Border, where he was promoted to Major and assigned to the Inspector General's office in Washington D.C.. He remained in his post for the next few years, where his ability in French allowed him to translate many of the French reports on the battles of the Weltkrieg, earning him a promotion to Colonel in 1918 and later Brigadier General in 1920, and allowing him to meet the up-and-coming George C. Marshall in the War Department. He was then transferred to Fort Meade, where he was introduced to George S. Patton, quickly becoming friends and through which he was introduced to Eisenhower, both of which quickly became friends and seeming pupils of Conner. This would lead him to choose Eisenhower to follow him to Panama after being assigned to its garrison, and despite their disagreements on motorized divisions and the usage of tanks in modern war. He was promoted to Major General in 1925 and was proposed by Pershing for Chief of Staff in 1930, although he was ultimately passed on in favour of Douglas MacArthur. He has since then being assigned to the First Army, and he is known to maintain regular correspondence with Marshall, Patton and Eisenhower still.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Soon to retire from the Army."

USA_support_business:0 "Support Businesses"

USA_america_business_is_business:0 "America's Business is Business"
USA_america_business_is_business_desc:0 "American industry was the backbone of our country. While the ravages of the Civil War have destroyed much of our once-prosperous commercial sector, with the proper amount of government action it can be brought back into prominence."
USA_immigration_act:0 "Immigration Act"
USA_immigration_act_desc:0 "While some may say immigration is the backbone of our country, we have more pressing concerns then letting more people into our destroyed country. Rebuilding our once-great country should take precedence."
USA_hays_code:0 "Hay's Code"
USA_hays_code_desc:0 "While everyone enjoys a good film now and then, the unchecked moral excesses of Hollywood need to be clamped down on. A strict code of conduct for actors and producers is required to avoid the spread of syndicalist messaging in films."
USA_american_laisze_faire:0 "Laissez Faire Economics"

USA_moral_education:0 "Moral Education"
USA_moral_education_desc:0 "Higher education has long been a bastion of the elite, and it should be kept that way. The prestigious halls of the Ivy Leagues are no place for those not prepared.

USA_new_american_century_desc:0 "In the time since our election, we have created a foundation to restore America to greatness. Rebuilding from the Civil War will take time, but we now out to the world, ready for a new century of greatness."
USA_states_autonomy:0 "Strengthen State Autonomy"
USA_states_autonomy_desc:0 "The federal government can not be expected to administrate everything.

USA_patriotic_shorts:0 "Patriotic Shorts"
USA_patriotic_shorts_desc:0 "With the population notably short on both entertainment and patriotism in these trying times we should use the recent growth of cinema to promote patriotism.

USA_family_law:0 "Family Law"
USA_family_law_desc:0 "The strong society requires a strong society but sadly too many socially irresponsible citizens ignore this.

USA_expand_national_guard:0 "Expand the National Guard"
USA_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "A strong military is more important than ever if we are to survive in our present situation.

USA_entente_support:0 "Entente Support"
USA_entente_support_desc:0 "There are few entities left that are loyal to both tradition and democracy but one of them is the anti-Syndicalist Entente.

We must request support in these trying times."
USA_self_regulation:0 "Self Regulation"
USA_self_regulation_desc:0 "New trade groups are seeking to court our favor by showing interest in upholding social values via industrial self-regulation, in which their respective industries ensure minimal quality of life for workers and respect for patriotism, starting with a new attempt by universities to stomp out radical thought. We should promote any such industries who follow this model and provide them with small tax breaks."
USA_hays_code:0 "Hays Code"
USA_hays_code_desc:0 "Following our promotion of self-regulation, several Hollywood leaders under the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America have sought to be more in-line with the current trend by assembling a code of ethics to be followed by the film industry aimed at promoting social conservatism. We should help coordinate with them to write the guidelines and promote such films."
USA_stop_desecration:0 "Protect American Symbols"
USA_stop_desecration_desc:0 "The radicals would destroy every symbol of Americanism due to their maddening totality of belief in class conflict. Enough! The government shall promote the heavier use of patriotic symbols via contact with industrial trade groups, use more American symbols on government property and ban flag desecration under penalty of a small fine."
USA_welfare_reform:0 "Tighten Welfare Requirements"
USA_welfare_reform_desc:0 "Local and state welfare had been expanding since the late 20th century but their resources are famously short as of now.

USA_levering_act:0 "Levering Act"
USA_levering_act_desc:0 "New Hampshire Senator Styles Bridges has, with assistance from New Jersey Representative J.

USA_market_liberals_in_power_desc:0 "The Republican Party, champions of free trade, deregulation, and the financial sector, have won the [GetYear] elections. Citizens can expect to see lower taxes, better prices, and a return of the can-do individualist spirit of American capitalism."
USA_settelment_movement:0 "Settlement Movement"
USA_settelment_movement_desc:0 "The Settlement Movement was popular in pre-Weltkrieg England and America, and focused on bringing the rich and poor together in 'settlement houses' to better understand each other. We should encourage a revival of this movement in these difficult social times."

USA_incentivize_charity:0 "Incentivize Charity"
USA_incentivize_charity_desc:0 "Currently there is a large swath of the population that needs our aid but, as usual, direct government intervention would be inefficient compared to private intervention.

USA_local_budgeting:0 "Local Budgeting"
USA_local_budgeting_desc:0 "Decentralization of the economy makes up much of the backbone of our beliefs and so it should go with the national budget, with local governments being given greater flexibility to set budgets and being recognized by our political leaders for saving money where they can."
USA_naval_expansion:0 "Naval Expansion"

USA_infastructure_investment:0 "Infrastructure Investment"

Instead, we should endeavor to increase our cooperation and trade with our Southern neighbors for the mutual benefit of all involved."
USA_reduce_subsidies:0 "Reduce Subsidies"
USA_reduce_subsidies_desc:0 "Subsidies are an example of government overreach. It is difficult to know how much is enough in a subsidy, or if it will benefit either party at all. More often than not, it is merely wasted money. We should reduce government subsidies as much as possible and let the invisible hand of the market guide our business world."
USA_education_campaign:0 "Education Campaign"
USA_education_campaign_desc:0 "Farm children are often kept out of school, with the excuse that they are needed as hands on the farm. This will no longer be the case.

USA_tolerance_campaign:0 "Tolerance Campaign"
USA_tolerance_campaign_desc:0 "What someone drinks or consumes in their time is not the business of the government. So long as it does not interfere with their work life, we should encourage tolerance of such practices.

### Social Liberals ###
USA_progressive_taxation:0 "Liberal Taxation"

USA_social_liberals_in_power_desc:0 "The Liberal Republicans have won the [GetYear] election! Their agenda is a continuation of the pre-Civil War progressive wing of the Republican party, prioritizing liberal free trade, progressive social policies, and a moderate welfare state."
USA_country_life_movement:0 "Country Life Movement"
USA_country_life_movement_desc:0 "The Country Life movement emphasizes a return to a rural lifestyle, and has grown popular among those disillusioned with city life following the turmoil of recent years.

USA_efficiency_movement:0 "Efficiency Movement"
USA_efficiency_movement_desc:0 "30 years ago in the height of the Progressive Era, the Efficiency Movement tried to eliminate superfluous waste from the household and the workplace.

USA_chautauqua:0 "Chautauqua"

USA_four_freedoms:0 "Four Freedoms"
USA_four_freedoms_desc:0 "Americans enjoy four key freedoms that most of the world lack. The freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want, and most importantly, the freedom from fear. With our Civil War now concluded, we must make sure all our citizens, no matter their skin color or religion, can enjoy these freedoms."
USA_liberal_unions:0 "Support Liberal Unions"
USA_liberal_unions_desc:0 "Not all unions are nests of syndicalism. Some actually stand for the betterment of the working class, rather than just advancing the selfish goals of their leaders. We should support these unions, both to protect our workers and undercut syndicalists still hiding in the country."
USA_mathematical_tables_project:0 "Mathematical Tables Project"
USA_mathematical_tables_project_desc:0 "There is a misconception that the unemployed masses of America are uneducated and lazy. We will prove that this is not true. To do this, we have found some of the most talented and intelligent individuals in the country who, despite their intellect, find themselves out of luck. These individuals will tabluate higher mathematical functions among other things."
USA_new_progressive_era:0 "New Progressive Era"

These measures will go a long way in curbing corporate mistreatment of workers while also bolstering the economy."
USA_federal_one:0 "Federal One Project"
USA_federal_one_desc:0 "Industrial workers aren't the only people who have to eat. The government will employ thousands of artists, musicians, actors, writers, and other cultural figures.

USA_agricultural_adjustment:"Agricultural Adjustment Act"
USA_agricultural_adjustment_desc:"There are many ideas for how to help our farmers in this crisis.

USA_new_nationalism:0 "New Nationalism"
USA_new_nationalism_desc:0 "This New Nationalism regards the executive power as the steward of the public welfare.

USA_labor_relations_act:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
USA_labor_relations_act_desc:0 "Poor relations between the owners and working classes was a major spark for the Civil War. We need to enact legislation that will ensure workers are protected from exploitation."

USA_removing_money_from_politics_desc:0 "Money is a cancer that has infected our political system for decades. For too long, politicians have been at the whim of their donors in the oil and steel industries, while simultaneously ignoring their loyal supporters. This will no longer be the case. Legislation banning all forms of dark money in politics will be passed while the amount of legal money that should be allowed in donations is still being debated."
USA_national_electricity:0 "National Electricity"
USA_national_electricity_desc:0 "The American people need affordable electricity and they need it now.

USA_power_of_the_ballot:0 "Power of the Ballot"
USA_power_of_the_ballot_desc:0 "We can no longer allow for the American people to be left out of decisions concerning a government that affects them all.

USA_wealth_taxation:0 "Wealth Taxation"
USA_wealth_taxation_desc:0 "We cannot allow America to become a new aristocracy that eliminates divine right of monarchy but replaces it with wealth.

USA_new_public_works:0 "Public Works"
USA_new_public_works_desc:0 "We need to knock out two for the price of one and combat both the unemployment and under-development that poses a national security risk.

It may be expensive, but the hope it offers America is priceless."
USA_encourage_temperance:0 "Encourage Temperance"
USA_encourage_temperance_desc:0 "Overconsumption of liquor is little more than a gateway to poverty, madness, and sloth, and it remains one of the great social ills of our times.

USA_citizen_education:0 "Citizen Education"

USA_national_railroads:0 "National Railroads"
USA_national_railroads_desc:0 "Our country is sadly lacking in providing a public means of national production while the Railroad Brotherhood desires greater protection from their bosses.

USA_credit_unions:0 "Support Credit Unions"
USA_credit_unions_desc:0 "It is time to shake off the influence banks have over the lives of workers, farmers and the free-laborer.

USA_national_health_insurance:0 "National Health Insurance"
USA_national_health_insurance_desc:0 "When our citizens fall ill they are expected to pay for the right to live.

USA_fair_house_trade:0 "Fair House Standard Trade"
USA_fair_house_trade_desc:0 "While trade has its place, especially for our farmers whom must export their goods, our workers can not be expected to compete with every nation on earth. It also undermines our cause to accept cheap goods from nations that do not accept similar working conditions. Goods that will lower the wages of our workers will pay a higher tariff."
USA_protect_strikers:0 "Protect Strikers"
USA_protect_strikers_desc:0 "Strikers are little more than workers asserting their rights in the face of abysmal working conditions and yet governors, bosses, and judges believe they have the right to make Marxists look vindicated by cracking down on these patriotic Americans. Striking will be recognized as a national right and the army will protect those whom are attacked by industrial goons."
USA_quota_act:0 "Quota Act"
USA_quota_act_desc:0 "With all the pressure already laid on American culture and worker wages that last thing we need is large amounts of untrained, cheap laborers pouring over the border.

USA_food_stamps:0 "Food Stamps"
USA_food_stamps_desc:0 "Henry Wallace had a revelation when he saw surpluses of agricultural goods on one hill and starving citizens on another. If the market won't achieve equilibrium on its own, we will give it the encouragement it needs with a food stamp program that will make it easier for poor citizens to afford farm goods."
USA_farm_credit_act:0 "Farm Bankruptcy Act"
USA_farm_credit_act_desc:0 "The madness of allowing our farms to close, especially in a time of depression, is utterly intolerable! A co-operative Farm Credit System will be created to provide farmers cheap loans and to prevent the avoidable foreclosure of the nations providers, for their welfare and our own."
USA_support_long:0 "Rescue the Kingfish"
USA_support_long_desc:0 "Is Huey Long a man without issue? Of course not; he runs a political machine and has a head the size of Mount Rushmore. However, he is an ally of the progressives in his region and his territory is a stalwart against the authoritarians while his economic policies promise to help break radicalism. We shall do for him what he is attempting to do for America and save him from the loons and cowards whom surround him."

USA_return_to_true_americanism_desc:0 "The National People’s Party have won the 1940 election! Their agenda is a hybrid of Dixiecrat, Fordist and Nativist ideology, reflecting the big-tent nature of the party. They call for a return to small government, the dismantlement of the welfare state built by Norris and the formulation of a national policy to \"maintain America’s White Anglo-Saxon Protestant character\" at all costs."
USA_end_federal_largesse:0 "End Federal Largesse"
USA_end_federal_largesse_desc:0 "While the Progressives may claim that the system they created will lead a \"just and square America for all to enjoy\", we know better. What they have created is nothing more than a system of near Gracchian largesse, which will do nothing other than to make all Americans the clients of the Progressives and their friends in Washington. To ensure that all citizens continue to remain free men rather than slaves, we must therefore dismantle the so-called \"Fair Deal\" established by Norris. To wean the people off the poisoned chalice they have been offered will be difficult, but its rewards will be all the sweeter in the end."
USA_corporatism_not_councilism:0 "Corporatism Not Councilism"

With this in mind, we will begin by removing the unnecessary regulations and oversights imposed on the market, which threatened to strangle business in its entirety. In America, business fulfill its social function through the positive relationship of the capitalist and his worker, not through the demands of the bureaucrat and the union boss. \n\nWe will remind all of this fact by putting the emphasis on Fordism rather than Crypto-Syndicalist political oversight as the recipe for our social model, and let the private sector stand free once again."

They claimed that they would bring about a new era of stability and prosperity, bringing about Jefferson’s agrarian idyll. In actuality, the government programs targeting farmers have made them less independent and more beholden to the rich and powerful than ever. \n\nTheir dependence on government assistance to escape the horrors of the depression have tied to aid programs which are now held above their heads to justify lowering prices, growing certain varieties of crops and more. It is our imperative duty to break apart these arrangements and return power and control to the farmers, lest farming become the sole prerogative of the state. They may complain now, but they will thank us later."

The Norris presidency marked the apogee of this tendency, as federal power was used as a battering ram ahead of the implementation of their un-American agenda. Now that we have taken power, we will pursue a policy of restoring autonomy to the states, and re-assuring regions like the South of our commitment to letting them once again govern themselves."

No amount of raids, prison sentences and executions can dissuade them, with some even being emboldened by the action taken against them.

This troublesome behavior can clearly only be met with a more permanent solution. \n\nConsequently, we will begin to send these agitators and their followers to the shores of those states to whom they profess loyalty.

Even the Department of Justice has been known to call on these brave men when conventional law enforcement can no longer cope with the circumstances at hand. \n\nIn recognition of these facts, and in view of the circumstances we now face, we will once again call on the Pinkertons for help.

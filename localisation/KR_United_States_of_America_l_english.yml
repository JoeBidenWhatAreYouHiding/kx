### Ideas ###
USA_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
USA_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis, the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

USA_black_monday:0 "The Great Depression"
USA_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

USA_black_monday2:0 "The Great Depression"
USA_black_monday2_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

USA_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
USA_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea_desc:0 "While we may have won the Civil War, our country is in ruins. Most people are forced to barter; electrity, running water, and other basic services barely function; and millions are starving or ill, especially the thousands and thousands of orphans."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea2:0 "Slight Recovery from the Civil War"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea2_desc:0 "While we may have stopped the cholera epidemics and famines, most of the country is still on fire. The only place one can find any modicum of stability is the heavily guarded military depots containing newly-delivered famine relief aid and medicine."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea3:0 "Partial Recovery from the Civil War"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea3_desc:0 "The cities have returned to some level of stability, and currency is starting to come back into use as bartering fades. The mass graves are now covered in saplings and flowers as the nation slowly claws itself back from collapse."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea4:0 "Advancing Recovery from the Civil War"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5:0 "Nearly-Full Recovery from the Civil War"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country. Factories have re-opened, and trains, busses, and other forms of public transportation have started running with some regularity. America has nearly returned to its pre-war standard of living."

### Events - Pre Election ###

ustates.1.t:0 "The United States in 1936"
ustates.1.d:0 "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. Although able to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, which allowed its prosperity to continue well into the 1920s, German victory in the Weltkrieg, followed by the French and British Revolutions, led to the Wall Street crash of 1925. This sent the United States spiralling into the Great Depression and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed entirely to reverse the decline of the American economy, and by 1936 the country had spent over a decade in the midst of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This fuelled the rise of radical parties in America from the far-left Socialist Party of America, to the far-right America First Party. Hoover's contentious re-election by means of the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."
ustates.1.a:0 "God Save America."

ustates.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits America"
ustates.2.d:0 "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Wall Street Crash of 1925. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Both Reed and Long have railed hard against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."
ustates.2.a:0 "This is just not our year."

ustates.3.t:0 "The Coalition Ticket?"
ustates.3.d:0 "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America or the America First Party would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed within the halls of power to form a coalition ticket between the Republican and Democratic Parties with Vice President Charles Curtis as the presidential candidate. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength."
ustates.3.a:0 "A Coalition, if you can keep it."
ustates.3.b:0 "A Coalition would debase the democratic system."

ustates.4.t:0 "Southern Democrats Complain"
ustates.4.d:0 "Although the coalition is showing signs of success, there is already some dissent from the various factions. The loudest voices belong to those of the Southern Democrats, many of whom are much more conservative and are facing stiff competition from the America First Party candidates. The coalition has been largely dominated by northern Democrats and Republicans, with the Progressives being the third wing of the coalition. We could try and force a compromise by promising to appoint southern Democrats to the cabinet and other positions of power if we win. Of course, we could also ignore their protest and focus on winning the election instead."

ustates.4.b:0 "Promise to appoint them to the cabinet."

ustates.5.t:0 "Disunity within the coalition"
ustates.5.d:0 "The Democratic and Republican parties have long been at odds since they came to national prominence. As we try to keep our coalition party together, a number of Democrats and Republicans have been getting into verbal shouting matches in Congress. While they are just minor members, the conflict could destabilize the whole coalition if it is allowed to spread. We can either come down hard on one side, or try to force some kind of compromise by pressuring rabble rousers to keep still until after the election – either way, it should end public dissent for now."
ustates.5.a:0 "Side with the Democrats."
ustates.5.b:0 "Force a compromise."
ustates.5.c:0 "Side with the Republicans."

ustates.6.t:0 "Curtis's Nomination"

This massive rally has been surprisingly well received by the press and those attending it. Hopefully, it can translate to election results."
ustates.6.a:0 "Let us pray that this helps us."

ustates.7.t:0 "Disunity within the coalition"
ustates.7.d:0 "In Iowa, a number of Progressives have gotten into a conflict with the Republicans. The Republicans are accusing the Progressives of alienating people needed to win the election while the Progressives are accusing the Republicans of not pushing for the policies needed to end the Depression. This fighting is driving a wedge in the coalition."

ustates.8.d:0 "Since the nomination of Vice-President Curtis as the presidential candidate, the politically minded have discussed with great interest the likely vice-presidential candidate. Finally putting the rumours to rest, Quentin Roosevelt was announced as the VP for the coalition ticket yesterday in New York City. In his announcement, he emphasized wanting to help bring major reforms to the country through a plan called the Fair Deal. Though this plan was denounced by the SPA and AFP as being nowhere near enough to help the average American, economists believe that it may be enough to end the Depression."

ustates.9.t:0 "Indian Citizenship Act"
ustates.9.d:0 "In order to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that the Indian Citizenship Bill be passed, effectively elevating all indigenous peoples of the United States from second-class citizens to full citizenship. Northeastern and Western politicians in both the major parties support this, while some Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans have deemed it frivolous."
ustates.9.a:0 "Pass the Act, hopefully, this will gain us some sympathy!"
ustates.9.b:0 "Veto the Bill, this is no time for populism."

ustates.10.t:0 "The Coalition falls apart!"
ustates.10.d:0 "The conflicts within the Coalition party have spiralled out of control and today it seems that the coalition party cannot stand together in Congress. The Republicans, Democrats and Progressives have all gone their separate ways back to their old rhetoric. The ever-present Capitol rumour mill has it that General Douglas MacArthur could save America, should either Reed or Long take over."
ustates.10.a:0 "God save America, for nobody else can…"

ustates.11.t:0 "Increasing Radicalisation"
ustates.11.d:0 "With the Democrats and Republicans fighting among themselves, as usual, more and more Americans are feeling alienated from the traditional big two and are flocking to the radical AFP and SPA throughout the country. In these dark times, the distinction between genuine social reform and graft is hard to distinguish. Those under the radical banner in their political enclaves have received some social welfare. Share Our Wealth donations from the AFP, and International Red Aid from the SPA. The party machine of these radicals utilizes mass media to a much stronger degree than either the Republicans or Democrats. It is looking more and more like the 1936 election will come down to Reed or Long."
ustates.11.a:0 "This is really bad."

ustates.12.t:0 "Progressives flock to the SPA"
ustates.12.d:0 "Minnesota, which has long been a bastion of the Progressive Senator Floyd Olson, has finally flipped. Many people are turning away from Senator Olson on the direction of the IWW and SPA. Various unions have held rallies for the SPA, and attendance far outstrips our ability to out-shout them."
ustates.12.a:0 "Is it something in the water?"

ustates.13.t:0 "Southern Democrat voters align with the AFP"
ustates.13.d:0 "The South has long been considered the heartland of the Democratic Party, but this may not be the case for much longer, as polls show a massive spike in voter registration for the AFP.

ustates.14.t:0 "MacArthur speaks to Hoover"
ustates.14.d:0 "MacArthur has spoken to President Hoover privately about a contingency plan called War Plan White, a military plan for dealing with a possible armed uprising of US citizens. The plan would call on MacArthur to take emergency action to protect the country, and re-erect old barricades in Washington D.C. This plan can be engaged even from outside Washington D.C, at the Washington Arsenal.

While they were posing, a group of forty men from the Ford's Service Department, approached them from behind and began to beat them with their batons. The group then continued their attack on some of the beret-wearing women present to pass out leaflets."

He is a raving anti-Semite, who claims that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fomented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so that his hateful message cannot reach the public."

'Oh,' he said, 'considerable. They're both good but they're different,' he said.\n\n'That High Popalorum is made from the bark off the tree that we take from the top down. And that Low Popahirum is made from the bark that we take from the root up.'\n\nAnd the only difference that I have found between the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership was that one of 'em was skinning you from the ankle up and the other from the ear down — when I got to Congress."

Elizabeth Gurley Flynn spoke at the funeral saying 'History has a long-range perspective. It ultimately passes stern judgement on tyrants and vindicates those who fought, suffered, were imprisoned, and died for human freedom, against political oppression and economic slavery.'\n\nMany other leaders within various Union organizations including his rivals in the AFL also spoke at his funeral as well as leaders within the Socialist Party of America. Jack Reed also spoke at the funeral ending his speech with some of Haywood's quotes, 'If the workers are organized, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped. A strike is an incipient revolution. Many large revolutions have grown out of a small strike. Remember that you are fighting more than your own fight. You are fighting for the entire working class and you must stand together.'"

ustates.21.d:0 "For some time the violence has been mostly between the supporters of the radical parties, however recently the violence is now reaching the candidates and politicians themselves. Failed attempts on the lives of both Huey Long and Jack Reed have occurred in the past few months. Both gunmen shooting from a crowd, both failed, and both resulted in higher security.

Generally, things are peaceful, though there have been confrontations with the police. However this time things are more violent than normal. Clashes between the Socialists and the local police backed up by the AFP have occurred around the country. The question is who is at fault? The Socialists declare that things were peaceful till the police and the AFP goons arrived on the scene. The AFP is saying that the Socialists began by assaulting ununionized workers, and have blurry photos they claim are guns the SPA were brandishing."

The rivers and their tributaries had already overflowed their banks and were soon threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On March 17, 1936, the waters reached the flood stage of twenty-five feet. Then, overnight, heavy rain caused the water to rise even higher, and on March 18, the water peaked at about forty-six feet, twenty-one feet above the flood stage.\n\nThis is the worst such disaster in the city's history, and local authorities have already requested federal aid."

The AFP have called their group 'the Minutemen', while the SPA's 'the Red Guard'. Seen patrolling their strongholds and party rallies, these well-armed and equipped paramilitary units have already engaged in scattered, though extremely violent conflicts. We believe the paramilitaries are modifying civilian firearms, and the FBI's attempts to seize weapon stockpiles are too slow to stop gun runners. This could turn very bad, very fast."

Now, in July, the heat has reached all-time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures have reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures have reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934.\n\nThis comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, and Socialist and Syndicalist forces gathering strength in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to skyrocket, and this heat wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."

In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Reed has pledged to defend the interests of the workers and work to help revolutionize society for the good of all Americans. However, the SPA's slim majority in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the Senate, where the AFP has promised to filibuster any law it sees as detrimental to America."

Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict between AFP and SPA paramilitaries, Reed passed an executive order that forced state and federal governments to recognize a union's right to exist and engage in collective bargaining, without exception, thus forbidding Yellow Dog contracts.

Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression, Reed has moved to nationalize the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. This includes stopping banks from foreclosing on bankrupt homeowners. A filibuster by Senator Roosevelt has forced Reed to resort to an Executive Order, appealing yet again to national security. While popular with the lower classes, many in the upper classes claim Reed is drunk on his power and well on his way to declare himself a dictator."

To most of Reed's cabinet, it was clear that private mining companies would be entirely unable to balance the needs of the public with their greed, and moved to nationalize the drilling and mining companies, included Standard Oil, whose case against Executive Order 7089 was still pending. This has been seen by many as an attack against a political rival, and further confirmation that Reed wishes to turn America into a syndicalist state like the Commune of France or the Union of Britain."

ustates.48.d:0 "Although Reed has shown no sign of concern over Standard Oil vs. Paul Mattick in public, his administration is concerned that the conservative-leaning Supreme Court could rule 7-2 in favour of the capitalists, and revert whatever reforms had already been put in place. Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Reed has asked Senate Majority Leader Meyer London to remove the filibuster for judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that he intends to appoint 6 pro-socialist justices to the bench, which will ensure his Executive Orders will remain constitutional. This has provoked a firestorm of protest, even from the left-leaning Farmer-Labor and Progressive parties, which had up until now remained neutral or supportive of Reed."

MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by SPA informants in MacArthur's command staff, Reed was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to Chicago. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Reed from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."

The order enforces price controls on farm products, provides credit to the farmers and provide tariffs on grains and other cereals. This will reverse the price slump that is driving farmers into poverty. Unwilling to wait to overcome the Senate filibuster, and citing the violent conflict that is going on in America, Long passed the executive order bypassing Congress entirely.

Also included with the executive order is a wide array of tax increases on the wealthiest Americans. While incredibly popular with the AFP's base, and hardly unexpected considering Long's 'Share the Wealth' slogan, many Americans are protesting what appears to be a massive overstep of the executive power of the president. The constitutionality of increasing taxes by fiat, and how this new agency would even manage to operate, are questions that has thrown the government into immediate chaos and confusion. Long has already begun campaigning hard, using press releases to rail against the 'corporate order' which would see America fall to syndicalist rhetoric."
ustates.56.a:0 "Sharing our wealth is our only defence!"

ustates.57.t:0 "Executive Order 7048 declared Unconstitutional"
ustates.57.d:0 "In a highly publicized court case, Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes has declared that executive order 7048 is unconstitutional. This was a narrow court case and was split 5-4 against the president. When news reached the White House, Long fumed at the news that the court would block the necessary reforms needed to ensure the safety of America."
ustates.57.a:0 "Charles Hughes has made his decision, now let him enforce it!"

ustates.58.t:0 "Packing the Court"
ustates.58.d:0 "The decision by the Supreme Court to declare his executive order unconstitutional has made Long take an extra-legal solution. Citing Lincoln's court-packing during the Civil War as precedent, Long has asked the Senate Majority Leader to remove the filibuster for Judicial appointees, and has increased the size of the Supreme Court to 15. It is clear that Long intends to appoint 6 pro-AFP justices to the branch that shall ensure that his executive orders will be constitutional. This has provoked a firestorm of protest throughout the country, even from the members of Congress that have so far remained neutral or supportive of Long."
ustates.58.a:0 "I shall defend the interests of the nation"

ustates.59.t:0 "Executive Order 7050: Declare SPA Terrorists"
ustates.59.d:0 "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Socialist Party of America, Huey Long has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organization which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Long has drawn a direct comparison between the SPA militias and the terrorist attacks that occurred on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The militias are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
ustates.59.a:0 "Excellent!"

ustates.60.t:0 "Reed Defies the Order"
ustates.60.d:0 "Jack Reed publicly denounced the Order as being unconstitutional and an act that would provoke the country's workers against Long. Reed has organized large rallies and protests against them with the Red Guard there to keep the workers safe from the Minutemen. These highly reported on protests have seen union scabs beaten without interference from the police, which calls into question Long's ability to protect Americans."
ustates.60.a:0 "Rely on the police to keep control"

ustates.61.t:0 "Union Workers and Police Clash"
ustates.61.d:0 "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and other cities scattered throughout the Steel Belt, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the workers. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declare that they would not follow the Laws of 'King Long'. Thus Long called in the US Army to enforce his laws."
ustates.61.a:0 "Send in the big boys"

ustates.62.t:0 "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
ustates.62.d:0 "When the Minutemen arrived in the Steel Belt to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the SPA and its supporters. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Steel Belt. It has quickly noticed that the governmnet has no remaining authority within the Steel Belt."
ustates.62.a:0 "Send in the biggest guys we've got"

ustates.63.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Long"
ustates.63.d:0 "Long's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today to restore order, having declared Long to be a tyrant and attempted to arrest him at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, Long was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to New Orleans. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."
ustates.63.a:0 "My allegiance was to the Republic, MacArthur, to democracy!"

### President Curtis ###

ustates.64.t:0 "Charles Curtis's Inauguration"
ustates.64.d:0 "After his election, Curtis addressed the nation. Curtis called for patience and civility in these difficult times. Reinvigorated by victory, the elder statesman boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary. Whether the rest of the nation would listen to the message was another story."
ustates.64.a:0 "America is One Nation Indivisible!"

ustates.65.t:0 "Curtis Announces Negotiations"
ustates.65.d:0 "President Curtis has announced that his first priority as president is to end the strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Bill Haywood in Chicago to negotiate. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers. Our negotiators believe that Curtis's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA, but President Curtis is determined."
ustates.65.a:0 "This is the only way"

ustates.66.t:0 "Reed Accepts Invitation"
ustates.66.d:0 "Jack Reed has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. An FBI intelligence file on Reed indicates that, should Reed fail in negotiation, the leaders of the AFL are likely to leave the general strike and defect from the SPA. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of Curtis's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavour. They say President Curtis is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
ustates.66.a:0 "I survived cancer, I can handle this"

ustates.67.t:0 "Negotiations Begin"
ustates.67.d:0 "Curtis gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'Today we are endeavoring to save the system we call Capitalism, by attempting to curb selfish individualism, and the avaricious profit motive. That there will be anything left of the so-called capitalistic system, is very doubtful. That there will be great change is certain.' President Curtis and Bill Haywood have sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago. though before the meeting can even begin word has arrived that Huey Long has demanded America First be involved in the negotiations. The presence of Long in the meeting will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing Long could incite his supporters in the south and make success in Chicago worthless."
ustates.67.a:0 "Allow Long to participate"
ustates.67.b:0 "Long has no business here"

ustates.68.t:0 "Reed Demands SPA take Social Security"
ustates.68.d:0 "After several days of negotiations, President Curtis and Jack Reed have come to terms. In order for Reed to call off the strike, he wants to see Congress immediately pass bills mandating a livable minimum wage, a maximum 40-hour work week, and a federally-funded welfare system directly under the SPA's administration. He fell short of demanding trade unions be required to have a percentage of seats reserved in Congress, but only reluctantly. Even so, Curtis believes the bill will be a hard sell in Capitol Hill. It is, however, likely the only way to avoid further conflict."
ustates.68.a:0 "We'll see how Congress feels about this"
ustates.68.b:0 "Reed needs to make a better offer"

ustates.69.t:0 "Long Declares Curtis a Traitor"
ustates.69.d:0 "As President Curtis took Haywood's proposal before Congress, Huey Long and the AFP declared him a traitor to the American people for selling out Social Security to the SPA. AFP Senators walked out, refusing to listen to Curtis's impassioned plea that they compromise for the sake of peace. Those who remained listened uneasily, and as debate began it quickly became clear that the coalition would not hold in the face of socialist reforms. SPA Senators abandoned Congress, with Jack Reed declaring Curtis's offer worthless and his government too corrupt and dysfunctional to ever serve the American people."
ustates.69.a:0 "We tried, Dear America"

ustates.70.t:0 "Long and Reed Argue"
ustates.70.d:0 "As the meeting in Chicago began in earnest, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed were not going to find middle ground. Both men had contradictory views, and this led to heated arguments. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. President Curtis did his best to keep things civil, but Long and Reed could agree on nothing. Long pushed back at the every measure Reed brought up, save for social security. Jack Reed has threatened to leave the negotiations if Long is not removed."
ustates.70.a:0 "Remove Long from the meeting"
ustates.70.b:0 "Try to work with both the men"

ustates.71.t:0 "Long Ejected from Negotiations"
ustates.71.d:0 "President Curtis called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, Long forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Curtis of selling out Social Security to the syndicates. In a fever pitch, Long began reciting anti-capitalist quotes Curtis had made during his tenure as Governor of Minnesota. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery."
ustates.71.a:0 "Nobody can negotiate in that state"

ustates.72.t:0 "Minutemen Attack the SPA in Chicago"
ustates.72.d:0 "After Huey Long was forcibly removed from the negotiations, Minutemen attacked members of the SPA party in the street just outside the building. An impromptu battle erupted as armed Minutemen clashed with Red Guard and Federal forces. Fearing for his safety, and more than a little suspicious this was all simply a ruse to see him assassinated and blame placed on the AFP, Jack Reed fled the building... followed shortly by President Curtis, who was taken to Washington out of security concerns. The negotiations have ended in disastrous failure."
ustates.72.a:0 "Long has ruined peace!"

ustates.73.t:0 "The Compromise: Establish the NLB"
ustates.73.d:0 "After even more long days of talks between President Curtis and Jack Reed, during which several times the entire SPA delegation almost up and left the negotiations, a further compromise has been reached - one the SPA say they will not budge further upon. They have given way on SPA administration over the welfare system, but in return want federal funding for a new organization... including a national board acting as liason between unions and the government, one which the SPA *would* be in control of. This new liason would be named the National Labor Board, or NLB for short. Negotiators feel this package could pass Congress, but not without inciting AFP rage and potentially undoing all efforts to contain them in the South. The only possible way around that, according to advisors, is to bring Long and the AFP into negotiations now and get them on board prior to going public."
ustates.73.a:0 "Present this before Congress now"
ustates.73.b:0 "Bring in Long - we need the AFP's support"

ustates.74.t:0 "NLB Bill Narrowly Approved"
ustates.74.d:0 "In an emergency session of Congress, President Curtis - with Jack Reed beside him - presented the compromise bill for the NLRB before the gathered Senators. He made an impassioned plea, saying that he did not seek a full ratification. That could come in the months ahead. What he needed was a vote indicating that the larger goals in the bill were acceptable to Congress, as a message to the strikers that the federal government intended to act in good faith. While every AFP Senator left the building in outrage, refusing to take part in what they declared a 'surrender to syndicalism', Curtis's plea that the coalition hold and consider the need for peace had its intended effet: at five minutes to midnight, the Senate narrowly passed a motion of approval. Jack Reed, greatly relieved, said the SPA would now relay the good news to strikers... then the real talks could begin."
ustates.74.a:0 "A sane, democratic change"

ustates.75.t:0 "AFP Rejects the Compromise"
ustates.75.d:0 "As expected, Huey Long has gone on a rampage the moment news of the compromise went public. He has declared Curtis to be in league with Reed, the government to have failed in its mission to guard the United States against syndicalist interests, and that America's very soul was in jeopardy. While government officials attempted to urge calm, Long's words have struck a chord across the South, firing up AFP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them."
ustates.75.a:0 "If Long wants a fight, he's got one"

ustates.76.t:0 "Negotiations Reach Impasse"
ustates.76.d:0 "Huey Long and the AFP gladly accepted the President's invitation to come to the negotiating table, though they were less than pleased once presented with the proposed reforms. After several days of debate, the effort largely seems to have been for naught. Jack Reed and Huey Long argue incessantly on key points of the compromise, and Long's default position is one of hostility towards what he felt as a united front against him. Still, there are points in common between the AFP's and SPA's position, and as the days wear on President Curtis begins to become hopeful there may be signs of Long's resistance slowly wearing down. For the sake of peace, could he be persuaded to accept the terms?"
ustates.76.a:0 "We only need a few more days..."

ustates.77.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Curtis"
ustates.77.d:0 "It appears Curtis's time has run out. With the perception outside the Chicago meeting being that it is dragging on for too long, while the AFP and SPA continue to garner power, Curtis's own cabinet has lost its confidence that any resolution would be reached. With the cabinet's apparent co-operation, General Douglas MacArthur took charge of an emergency administration intended to 'preserve the country from extremist forces, before it's too late'. Bill Haywood and Huey Long have fled the Chicago meeting, both believing they have been utterly betrayed that the federal government would act while their guard was down. While the government is attempting to reassure the American public that all is under control, most are looking on in shock. Civil war appears imminent."
ustates.77.a:0 "So it has come to this"

ustates.78.t:0 "President Announces Hard Line"
ustates.78.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destablize America. Executive Orders have been issues to curb the ability of the America First Party and the Socialist Party of America to operate, this despite protests from Senators in both parties. All SPA and AFP Senators walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
ustates.78.a:0 "We will restore order, no matter what"

ustates.79.t:0 "Reed Condemns Police Violence"
ustates.79.d:0 "As the SPA strike continues, spreading outside of the Steel Belt, clashes between strikers and the police have becomes more common. Jack Reed has urged the AFL and IWW strikers to resist without violence, but this hasn't always worked - especially when the strikers are simultaneously provoked by America First supporters. Reed has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. 'What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed,' Reed declared in a Minneapolis speech. 'What they get instead is a government that acts at the behast of their capitalist overlords.'"
ustates.79.a:0 "We're trying to keep order!"

ustates.80.t:0 "Long Declares War On Tyranny"
ustates.80.d:0 "The SPA strikers aren't the only ones feeling the heat at the hands of American police. So, too, have the Minutemen come under increased scrutiny. Several Minutemen training centers in Alabama and South Carolina were raided by police in recent days, and AFP meetings have been constantly harassed - or so Huey Long has loudly complained. 'The federal government has opted for open tyranny,' he said. 'They will do anything to keep us down, when what we seek is a government that is worthy of us!' His recent speech in Charlotte was received by cheering crowds, indicative of the AFP's growing influence."
ustates.80.a:0 "We'll see about that!"

ustates.81.t:0 "The General Strike Spreads"
ustates.81.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention."
ustates.81.a:0 "It is coming!"

ustates.82.t:0 "Tension in the Steel Belt"
ustates.82.d:0 "As National Guardsmen arrive in the north to end the SPA strike, tensions remain high. Many of the various mayors and even governors were not just supportive of the strike but actively helping it. Consequently, they strongly oppose the use of the National Guard. The strikers have begun to taunt the guards, and have even assaulted scab workers brought into the factories under National Guard escort. It is clear a single spark can set off the entire American north. President [USA.GetLeader] remains undeterred by this, and declared on the radio that the general strike must end for the good of the nation, with the unsaid implication that force will be used if it doesn't."
ustates.82.a:0 "Force is necessary now"

ustates.83.t:0 "Clashes in the South"
ustates.83.d:0 "National Guard units today fought with Minutemen militia in northern Louisiana, a raid that soon turned into a bloodbath as Minutemen opened fire. In the end, over fourty Guardsmen were killed as well as an unknown number of Minutemen. Huey Long and the AFP denied involvement with the militia, but questioned the presence of the National Guard in what should clearly have been a police matter. The militia, they claim, were merely defending themselves. Photos of the ensuing bloody scene have circulated in southern newspapers, resulting in a new wave of outrage from the public directed at the federal government."
ustates.83.a:0 "But not at the Minutemen? Not even a little?"

ustates.84.t:0 "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
ustates.84.d:0 "All it took was a single spark to start the revolution, and in Pittsburgh that spark occurred when a crowd of people stood outside one factory determined to oppose the National Guard. Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving five dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the 'Pittsburgh Massacre' and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with SPA militia throughout the Steel Belt. Newspapers across the country have 'civil war' splashed across their headlines, and public panic is at a crescendo."
ustates.84.a:0 "What next?"

ustates.85.t:0 "J. Edgar Hoover's Proposal"
ustates.85.d:0 "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [USA.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP and SPA can become more organized. An assassination of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it centered around his personality. An assassination of Jack Reed, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. There would be consequences, Hoover advises, not least of all the rightful suspicion that would fall on a democratic government for taking such an extreme act... but these are desperate times. If the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."
ustates.85.a:0 "Take out Jack Reed and the SPA"
ustates.85.b:0 "Take out Huey Long and the AFP"
ustates.85.c:0 "We will not stoop to such undemocratic measures"

ustates.87.t:0 "Huey Long Assassinated!"
ustates.87.d:0 "Just outside the Lousiana state legislature in Louisiana, Huey Long - leader of the America First Party and prominent critic of the United States federal government - was shot to death by an assailant who, in turn, was killed by Long's bodyguards. The motives of the assassination are unknown, but while many are ascribing it to the Socialist Party of America, the SPA's leader Jack Reed has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at President [USA.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards the troubled government. The former Democrats within the AFP have silently deserted the more radical elements of the party, and the FBI reports that neither William Lemke nor Charles Coughlin have been able to meet with the AFP Congressmen."
ustates.87.a:0 "That's it for the AFP, at least"
ustates.87.b:0 "Interesting"

ustates.88.t:0 "Jack Reed Assassinated!"
ustates.88.d:0 "While returning from a meeting at the Indiana state legislature, Jack Reed - leader of the Socialist Party of America and head of the ICC - was shot to death by an unknown assailant. A manhunt is currently under way for the sniper, even as workers across America mourn his loss. While many are ascribing the deed to the America First Party, the AFP's leader, Huey Long, has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at President [USA.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards an already-troubled government. The labour leaders from the AFL have declared Reed's strike to be wildcat, and therefore have ordered their unions to return to work. The IWW has responded by declaring the AFL scabs, and it appears their brief cooperation has ended."
ustates.88.a:0 "That's it for the SPA, at least"
ustates.88.b:0 "Interesting"

ustates.89.t:0 "Reed Accuses the Government of Murder"
ustates.89.d:0 "With the country still reeling from Huey Long's death, and the AFP collapsing, Jack Reed has been quick to capitalise on the growing public anger. At a recent rally in Detroit, Reed all but accused the government of murder. 'I won't say that I agreed with Huey,' he said, 'but he wanted the life of the average American to be better. He wanted a government that was better, that stood for us all. What we have now is a government that stands only for capitalist greed, a cancer growing within the heart of American democracy which will kill anything that tries to cut it out.' Demonstrations across the country have echoed Reed's words, particularly in the South where Long's supporters have begun a campaign of violence against government targets, and it seems things will quickly get worse."
ustates.89.a:0 "We must brace for impact"

ustates.90.t:0 "Long Accuses the Feds of Murder"
ustates.90.d:0 "With the country still reeling from Jack Reed's death, and the SPA caught up in in-fighting to determine his rightful successor, Huey Long has been quick to capitalise on the growing public anger. At a recent rally in Alabama, Long all but accused the government of murder. 'We have been spared a devil who would have led us down the road to tyranny,' he said, 'but we must face another kind of tyranny in our own government. American democracy is dead, and it is President [USA.GetLeader] who has killed it. We must rise up and meet steel with steel, guns with guns!' Demonstrations across the country have echoed Long's words, particularly in the Steel Belt where SPA supporters have lashed out against government targets en masse, and it seems things will quickly get worse."
ustates.90.a:0 "We must brace for impact"


### Garner Path ###

ustates.91.t:0 "John N. Garner's Inauguration"
ustates.91.d:0 "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Garner was quoted as saying 'We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.' On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893. Garner enters the White House surrounded by hostile AFP and SPA Senators as well as wary Republicans, though he has assured the public that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
ustates.91.a:0 "God Save America"

ustates.92.t:0 "The Austerity Bill"
ustates.92.d:0 "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards the social security net. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression, and it was met with mostly skepticism and jeers from non-Democratic Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country."
ustates.92.a:0 "Believe in America"

ustates.93.t:0 "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
ustates.93.d:0 "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a North Carolina speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist rhetoric. Long said he would be directing AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."
ustates.93.a:0 "We shall see"

ustates.94.t:0 "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
ustates.94.d:0 "A demonstration in Washington D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Jack Reed condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."
ustates.94.a:0 "We are trying to keep order, Reed!"

ustates.95.t:0 "General Strike Spreads"
ustates.95.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
ustates.95.a:0 "Damned Fools!"

ustates.96.t:0 "Austerity Bill Voting Commences"
ustates.96.d:0 "Voting on the Emergency Austerity Measures bill began in Congress today, though early indications were not good. While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and there are enough Republican Senators remaining on the fence, unwilling to be swayed, that passage may prove unlikely without intervention. The president's cabinet is suggesting calling for a meeting of the major party representatives in Philadelphia, to try and work out a compromise - at least enough of one to make passage easier. It is also possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"
ustates.96.a:0 "Arrange the Philadelphia meeting"
ustates.96.b:0 "Let's campaign for the Republican vote"

ustates.97.t:0 "Philadelphia Meeting Begins"
ustates.97.d:0 "The historic meeting in Philadelphia began today, with all four major political parties present and President Garner appealing to them that a compromise on the austerity bill was necessary for the sake of national peace and prosperity. As the parties talked, however, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed would both absorb most of the attention. Despite the number of Senators they represent, everyone in the room knows very well the influence they hold in the country, and both men disagreed on almost every aspect of compromise. Reed wanted workers protected from cuts to government contracts, while Long wanted to add an Open Shop claue to austerity. While there is evidence that President Garner and Huey Long see eye-to-eye on many issues, it is quickly becoming clear that compromise will be utterly impossible with both men present."
ustates.97.a:0 "Eject Long and the AFP"
ustates.97.b:0 "Eject Reed and the SPA"
ustates.97.c:0 "We will all go together"

ustates.98.t:0 "Long and the AFP Kicked Out"
ustates.98.d:0 "President Garner called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, he forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Garner of throwing out fiscal responsibility for the syndicates' sake. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery. It was only after he left that the subdued remaining Senators could continue the negotiations."
ustates.98.a:0 "That's a bully right there!"

ustates.99.t:0 "Garner and Long Make Progress"
ustates.99.d:0 "President Garner called for Jack Reed and the SPA to be ejected from the meeting, though before Reed left he made a solemn speech to those present. He accused them of bowing to tyranny, that a government which didn't understand the worker would meet its ultimate fate at the hand of that worker. After his departure, however, things went much more smoothly. Long indicated he was willing to make compromises, so long as amendments to the austerity bill supporting Long's Share Our Wealth Society indirectly through tax breaks. With this, as well as putting Huey Long himself named as the head of a new Unamerican Activities Committee, he could go to his supporters and say that progress was finally being made. There are those present at the meeting, however, who caution that this will undoubtedly infuriate the SPA and make irrelevant any measures the government has undertaken to curb their control in the North."
ustates.99.a:0 "We can finally agree"
ustates.99.b:0 "We will not be blackmailed into such measures!"

ustates.100.t:0 "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
ustates.100.d:0 "Just as the remaining members of the meeting began to make headway, and it was looking as if a compromise on the austerity bill would be reached, word arrived in Philadelphia of a battle taking place in nearby Pittsburgh. SPA strikers had been attacked by Minutemen milita members, a fight which turned bloody when federal forces arrived on the scene and attempted to intervene. Several bombs were detonated, adding to the chaos, and the Senators received reports of unidentified militia forces advancing on Philadelphia. President Garner was evacuated from the building by his security forces, over his objections, and both the meeting and the vote have crumbled to a premature end."

ustates.101.t:0 "Long and Reed Stall Meeting"
ustates.101.d:0 "While President Garner's attempt to get Huey Long and Jack Reed to come to some kind of agreement was commendable, after several days of debate it appears to have mostly come to naught. Both men are frustrated, and several times each has threatened to walk out of the meeting entirely. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. Republicans are split on the matter, and there are not enough of them who will vote for the bill if they believe the country will erupt into violence anyhow. Both Long and Reed have given a deadline until tomorrow, at which point they say there is no chance of the Philadelphia meeting continuing. The gathered Senators are looking to the president to somehow solve the impasse."
ustates.101.a:0 "What can I do?"

ustates.102.t:0 "Austerity Bill Passes"
ustates.102.d:0 "With the endorsement of the AFP, the Emergency Austerity Measures bill passed - though not before all SPA Senators up and walked out of the chamber in protest. News of the exemptions, as well as the added restrictions on industrial unions and Huey Long's presence at the head of a new committee which will likely see more crackdowns on socialist activity, has fired up SPA supporters across the Steel Belt with outrage. Jack Reed has declared the government a dead and useless body, so corrupt it could not even see Long for the snake he truly is, and says the American worker will never get a fair shake unless he fights for it. Demonstrations have erupted across the northern part of the country - as suspected, making the government's efforts to combat SPA control useless - although, in the South, Long's assurances have gone a long way towards keeping his supporters quiet."
ustates.102.a:0 "If Reed wants a fight, he's got one"

ustates.103.t:0 "Austerity Bill Fails"
ustates.103.d:0 "While President Garner campaigned long and hard into the night, at the end of the day there were simply too few Republican Senators willing to vote for a bill that they didn't have the support of the SPA and AFP, and which would likely result in violence anyhow. Garner's austerity plan is seen as a poor follow up to the Garner-Wagner bill he co-authored in 1934. The entire vote was even delayed by an actual fist-fight between a Republican and a AFP Senator. In the end, the vote failed by a slim margin... though the margin might as well have been a chasm, into which all of President Garner's hopes and aspirations could be tossed."
ustates.103.a:0 "Congress isn't worth piss anyways"

ustates.104.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Garner"
ustates.104.d:0 "It appears President Garner's time is up. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. Garner's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent."
ustates.104.a:0 "So it has come to this"

### Alf Landon Path ###

ustates.105.t:0 "Alf Landon's Inaugural Address"
ustates.105.d:0 "Alf Landon was sworn in as the 31st president of the United States of America today. At his inaugural address Landon spoke of the challenges facing the nation in preserving a liberal democacy. Landon was quoted as saying 'Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization. And I think I will awaken America to that.' Landon concluded with a promise to solve the Depression with entrepreneurship. Creating a new generation of millionaires that will bring pride back to the nation. Whether anyone will listen is another matter."
ustates.105.a:0 "I treasure our American Democracy"

# Economic Intervention route
ustates.106.t:0 "Landon Proposes Intervention"
ustates.106.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Landon has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a comission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. Landon believes this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared opposition to the bill for not going far enough, and for being too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. It will take some cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to overcome this united front of radicalism in Congress."
ustates.106.a:0 "This bill will not stop for them"

ustates.107.t:0 "Reed calls Landon Corrupt"
ustates.107.d:0 "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepeneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. To Reed and the SPA, this is the smoking gun that Landon is a class traitor, though to many these accusations have rang hollow, citing Landon as a man with the business connections to make the intervention bill stick."
ustates.107.a:0 "I started with nothing, Reed, just like you!"

ustates.108.t:0 "Huey Long calls Landon a Monopolist"
ustates.108.d:0 "Huey Long has responded, like Reed, by decrying Landon as a corrupt politician in Standard Oil's pocket. Huey Long recently spoke about how President Landon only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of Landon's fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. President Landon, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish babboon - much to the public's amusement and Long's outrage."
ustates.108.a:0 "I am not Rockefeller, you fool!"

ustates.109.t:0 "Democrats Close Ranks"
ustates.109.d:0 "While many Democratic Senators are leery of supporting a bill which has such vociferous opposition by the SPA and the AFP, especially considering their influence in America goes far beyond the number of seats they hold in Congress, they have responded poorly to the personal attacks on the president by Long and Reed. Despite internal opposition for interfering with the market, Democrats have indicated they will support the president's bill."
ustates.109.a:0 "That's the solidarity I like"

ustates.110.t:0 "The 'New Deal' Bill Passes"
ustates.110.d:0 "The Economic Intervention Bill has managed to pass through Congress, and has been signed into law by President Landon. Banks are immediately ushered into silence as they reorganzie before recieving Treasury approval. The comission has begun to draft reforms to stock trading that will hopefully restore confidence in the markets. It is hard to say right away if this will solve the problem, but Landon hopes that this can be the first steps to fix the economy which all moderates can agree upon."
ustates.110.a:0 "We are finally awake to change"

ustates.111.t:0 "General Strike Spreads"
ustates.111.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, after a call by Jack Reed to demonstrate against the recently-passed intervention bill, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
ustates.111.a:0 "This is getting out of hand"

ustates.112.t:0 "Proposed Conference with Long and Reed"
ustates.112.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, Alf Landon's Secretary of Commerce has proposed a conference with both Huey Long and Jack Reed to try to arrange some sort of compromise. The Secretary says that the measures in the bill will not work unless the strikes and the violence are brought to an end. However, some within the Republican party are saying that this plan of action will not work, and claiming a conference with Long and Reed will debase their party."
ustates.112.a:0 "Ignore Long and Reed"
ustates.112.b:0 "Arrange the conference"

ustates.113.t:0 "The Great St. Louis Riot"
ustates.113.d:0 "The SPA has been aggravating the workers in the area to expand the strike. Local businesses in St. Louis have become utterly paralyzed. Many of them turned to the America First Party to provide a solution. Within days, the streets were flooded with Minutemen. There are wild reports from the chaos ranging from Minutmen stopping petty crime in the absence of police, to them creating the crime. Soon the situation had erupted into a wide scale riot. The chaos has been splashed across every newspaper in America, and within days SPA and AFP forces have begun to mobilize. War is upon us."
ustates.113.a:0 "So it begins now, does it?"

ustates.114.t:0 "Conference Begins"
ustates.114.d:0 "The conference between President Landon and both Huey Long and Jack Reed began, but within days it was clear that it was a lost cause. Long and Reed argued constantly, on almost every issue, and the only thing that united them was their personal detestation of Landon and his intervention bill. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, not least of which is due to constant newspaper coverage of the conference citing the two men as 'obstructionist' and 'unreasonable'. Reed and Long both see the president as the corrupt tool of corporate America, and rather than compromise their demands are tantamount to rolling back the intervention bill which has already been voted on and passed through Congress! Both are nearly ready to walk out, despite the president's pleading that they compromise for the sake of peace in the country."
ustates.114.a:0 "I have to save this conference"

ustates.115.t:0 "Scandal Rocks the Conference"
ustates.115.d:0 "While President Landon's conference is finally beginning to make slow progress, American newspapers turn their attention from Reed and Long to a different target: namely the revelation of an internal memo within General Motors corporation which indicates that not only is the company's planned settlement with strikers intended to be only temporary... but that they and other companies are being bribed into settlement by the federal government. A temporary setback as they make concessions to strikers in exchange for a bailout with the understanding that changes made can be easily undone. While many are denying this memo's veracity, the sensational aspect of the news is giving new fire to AFP and SPA supporters and is threatening to quickly escalate out of control."
ustates.115.a:0 "Cut the conference short, we need to call GM"
ustates.115.b:0 "We must keep the conference going, no matter what"

ustates.1150.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Landon"
ustates.1150.d:0 "While the conference continued for several days, it rapidly became evident that the scandal was not going to end - instead it was escalating as other sources came forward with similar information, much of it pointing to an insider effort engineered by President Landon himself. Both Jack Reed and Huey Long abandoned the conference, and as Landon did his best to save face in Congress it was clear that blame was being placed squarely on him for the conference's failure. With the crisis spiralling, General Douglas MacArthur has stepped in - with the full approval of Landon's own cabinet - to install an emergency government in the White House 'to save America from extremist forces before it's too late'. While the government has tried to assure Americans that things are under control, it's quickly becoming clear that civil war is imminent."
ustates.1150.a:0 "So it has come to this"


### Victory in the civil war

ustates.116.t:0 "MacArthur's Power"
ustates.116.d:0 "With our victory in the civil war, a question must be decided upon. Should Douglas MacArthur resign as President and ensure a peaceful transition of power or should he remain in control to protect America? Hard liners within MacArthur's clique insist that the US will fall back into civil war without him, while Republicans and some Democrats claim MacArthur would be a tyrant to stay."
ustates.116.a:0 "MacArthur remains in power."
ustates.116.b:0 "MacArthur gives up power."

ustates.117.t:0 "Democracy Triumphs"

ustates.117.a:0 "God Bless America."

ustates.118.t:0 "Malice or Charity"
ustates.118.d:0 "The question of what to do with those that fought against the government has to be decided. Shall we offer clemency to those that fought against the government and try and rehabilitate them back into society or shall they be punished for their actions against America?"
ustates.118.a:0 "Charity."
ustates.118.b:0 "Malice."

ustates.119.t:0 "The fate of the Electoral College"
ustates.119.d:0 "As we work to strengthen democracy following the civil war, the question of the Electoral College has been brought up. Many are calling for the end to first-past-the-post voting for state electors. This would be replaced by a more simple national popular voting system. A majority of Congress believes that we should keep FPTP around as a safeguard against radicalism in the future. What should we do?"
ustates.119.a:0 "We shall adopt Popular Vote."
ustates.119.b:0 "The Electoral College Stays!"

ustates.120.t:0 "National Rehabilitation"
ustates.120.d:0 "While we root out those that continue to still fight on for their treasonous cause, the question has come before MacArthur about what to do to those that have laid down their arms. Some of his advisers are suggesting clemency others suggest they must be imprisoned for their actions. What shall the commander in chief choose?"
ustates.120.a:0 "Down with the Traitors."
ustates.120.b:0 "We have spilt enough blood."

ustates.121.t:0 "Reconcile with Washington?"
ustates.121.d:0 "The Tyrant MacArthur has done the unthinkable and has stepped down from power. Thus a debate has arisen about if we should reunite and make America whole. Many believe that even though MacArthur has stepped down from power, he still has control and that he won't hesitate to re-assume power should politics don't go his way."
ustates.121.a:0 "Let us reunite with Washington(Game Over)"
ustates.121.b:0 "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

ustates.122.t:0 "America is reunited!"
ustates.122.d:0 "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
ustates.122.a:0 "From Sea to shining Sea!"

ustates.123.t:0 "No Reconciliation"
ustates.123.d:0 "Since MacArthur stepped down many wondered if the country would be whole again. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they denounced Congress as just being a pawn of MacArthur who they still regard as a tyrant despite the fact he saved the country."
ustates.123.a:0 "America one day shall be reunited."

ustates.124.t:0 "America is Reunited"
ustates.124.d:0 "At long last America has been reunited. We stretch once again from sea to shining sea. The traitors to the country have been destroyed and the stars and stripes now fly proudly from coast to coast knowing that liberty is secured for all."
ustates.124.a:0 "A more perfect union."

ustates.125.t:0 "The National Labor Relations Board"
ustates.125.d:0 "With the civil war over and reconstruction now under way, the question of trade unions have been brought up. Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a national labor relations board. This board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang. Others however, regard all trade unions as traitors to the country and should be outlawed toggether. Congress has decided to...?"
ustates.125.a:0 "Accept the AFL and KoL into the NLRB."
ustates.125.b:0 "Outlaw all Unions regardless of loyalty."

ustates.126.t:0 "Army is slow to desegregate"
ustates.126.d:0 "After the President signed a law to desegregate the Armed Forces, it seems that it is taking more time then expected to fully desegregate. There are still black only and white only regiments and several officers are determined to keep things separate. Despite the slowness, things are improving as more and more units are desegregating. Still, Progress is slow."
ustates.126.a:0 "Desegregation shall still happen."

ustates.127.t:0 "The Red Scare"
ustates.127.d.macarthur:0 "Since MacArthur has taken power he has begun a campaign against socialism, anarchism, and syndicalism. They are after all the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must know the role that they played in the conflict and as such as the so-called 'red scare' begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
ustates.127.d.elected:0 "Since the election of [USA.GetLeader], the government of the United States has begun a campaign against socialist of all stripes. They were one of the main instigators of the civil war and as such all Americans must understand their role. Moreover socialists and syndicalists must not allow their subversion to survive and as such as the so-called 'red scare' begins many are being forced out of jobs and are being blacklisted."
ustates.127.a:0 "Better Dead than Red."

ustates.128.t:0 "Lavender Scare"
ustates.128.d:0 "With the so-called Red Scare under way, [USA.GetLeader] has passed Executive Order 10450 that broadened the definition of a national security risk to include 'Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion.'. This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocracy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, has long been rumoured to be in the closet with his secretary Clyde TCurtis. As Director of the most important intelligence agency, Hoover is of course beyond investigation. Even if we were to, J. Edgar probably has much more dirt on us than we have on him."
ustates.128.a:0 "Let's not investigate J. Edgar Hoover."

ustates.129.t:0 "Trial of the Weapons companies"
ustates.129.d:0 "A number of Weapons companies have fought for the various traitors and rebels against America. Thus a hearing has been brought before Congress to decide their fate. Shall we allow them to operate again, or shall they be regarded as traitors and be treated as such?"

### Civil War avoided Events ###

ustates.150.t:0 "The Twentieth Amendment"
ustates.150.d:0 "The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution has been proposed. This amendment would make it so that the President of the United States of America is elected by the direct popular suffrage of the country. The current Electoral College system was last modified in the 14th Amendment almost a century ago. The bill, as proposed by a minority coalition of Social Democrats within the Republicans and Democrats has very little chance of succeeding. It is claimed by the supporters that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again. The party leadership of both e Republicans and Democrats disagree, saying that the Electoral College was the only thing that kept the United States from totally dissolving in 1936. A long week of debating has left every avenue explored, and ultimately..... "

ustates.152.d:0 "During the 1930s, a large part of the NAACP's activities were taken up by litigation in favour of African American rights. This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defence, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist public relations campaign.

A proposed civil works program to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace. The Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land.

Many Americans still blame him for the start of the depression and the political crisis that came from it that lead to the civil war. While on one hand he was and is praised for his work in regards to a number of progressive issues, notably Women's suffrage, he was never able to get prohibition passed, something he pushed for several times in Congress to no avail. He leaves behind a divided legacy. Despite this, when the civil war began his support for the provisional government in the west coast helped give it an air of legitimacy.

ustates.161.d:0 "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins Quentin Roosevelt's Speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."

Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalization go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalized but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalization.

Those in favour of federal primacy in Fair Deal reforms have called for a caucus of liberal Democrats. The press reported on the declerations made, and have dubbed the attendants 'Liberals' This new name has come to popular usage as of late, and is the informal name of this new breakoff party.

ustates.171.d:0 "President John Nance Garner has never had much respect for the Vice Presidency. During the National Convention, Garner refused any oeuvres to take the VP slot for someone else's campaign. Garner's choice of Sam Rayburn came with the implicit understanding that Rayburn's position meant very little to the executive branch. This is why today's newspaper of Rayburn coming out to criticizes Garner for failing to appease radicals was so shocking. Garner responded in interviews that he disregards anything the VP has to say, as 'Rayburn's position isn't worth a bucket of piss.'"

MacArthur's book speaks of his wise ability to see through Long and Reed's campaign, and his willingness to do anything to protect democracy. The tense days in Washington are described in great detail, with emphasis placed on the middle class victims of Red Guard and Minutemen attacks. The book also implies, within his chain of command, there were soldiers who advocated marching on Washington to settle the capitoline debates. MacArthur wouldn't name names, but he writes that he personally discouraged the soldiers from going through with this most treasonous plan."

ustates.174.d:0 "During a meeting today in the National Mall, a shot rang out during MacArthur's speech that nearly caused a stampede of fleeing onlookers. The gun was aimed at President MacArthur by a madman who, once arrested, claimed MacArthur was building a military junta and must be stopped. The ravings of this loon most interestingly have not been traced back to any political group, and it appears to be a lone wolf attempt on the President's life. MacArthur laughed off this ridiculous accusation and has increased the Secret Service's payroll to protect against any more lone wolves."

While young Quentin Roosevelt had stayed in partisan politics, albeit Republican as opposed to Franklin's democrat. Archibald Roosevelt has left the reservation entirely. Rumours of him associating with industrialists and railing against every president since Hoover including Quentin has come to a head. Archibald and Quentin have met to officially bury the hatchet of politics and reunite their family. This meeting also helps to drive home Quentin's atmosphere of reconciliation instead of punishing dissonance."

ustates.177.t:0 "Willkie Addresses NAACP"
ustates.177.d:0 "President Willkie, despite being a lifelong Democrat, never actively endorsed the Southern Democrat line on race. An early critic of John Nance Garner for failing to appeal to black voters in 1936, Willkie made up for that with a historic speech at the NAACP Convention. Speaking in favour of integration in the military, and also getting a few jabs at Republicans and Democrats for failing to protect black voters from the SPA. His speech ended with a support for Jewish rights to democracy, and forewarned that socialists would target them next if antisemitism reached the levels of racism in America. Democrats in Congress are currently ruminating over how to respond, with most wishing to remain silent until next election season."

ustates.178.d:0 "The Fair Deal negotiations agree on the main purpose of reform, to fix economic stagnation and reduce unemployment. One provision and its implications so perturbs President Byrd, that a majority of his address to Congress was spent condemning it. That National Highway system, which President Byrd describes as a 'massive waste and an enabler of eminent domain', echoing the Conservative Democratic opposition to any Fair Deal that adds land to the Federal Trust. This position puts Byrd in an interesting cross-section, as some Republicans who see the Highway as overtly anti-dissident as well have joined in his cause."

As president, Wallace has taken his share in Hi-Bred and instructed the Department of Agriculture to disseminate information about hybrid crops, which are beginning to show improvement in water retention over normal crops. The imperative to do this is the ongoing farming disaster in Oklahoma, where dust storms have taken out millions in food. Wallace hopes to solve this issue and save America's food supply."

ustates.180.t:0 "Taylor's Radical Proposal in Congress"
ustates.180.d:0 "Out of the several strange requests President Taylor has made over the years, this has to be the hardest to handle. President Taylor has convinced several Progressive Congressmen to revive his old legislation promoting World Unity. Explained as a successor to President Wilson's peace plans he spoke of as the Weltkrieg raged on, World Unity is the preservation of human life and culture and the end of total war. This proposal in Congress was of course defeated, but the gesture has surprisingly boosted President Taylor's reputation."
ustates.180.a:0 "We All Hope For Peace."

ustates.181.t:0 "Taylor Takes the Stage Nationwide"
ustates.181.d:0 "One of the many eccentric qualities of President Taylor is his singing career. From his time singing to children on the steps of the Capitol building to now singing in front of his millions of constituents. President Taylor has leveraged what would have made him a laughing stock in politics into a genuine expression of his patriotism in art. Taylor sings to promote unity in America over politics, and cooperation instead of victory."
ustates.181.a:0 "Sing On, Jim!"

ustates.182.t:0 "Barkley Ends The Corvee System"
ustates.182.d:0 "A division appears between President Barkley and the Democratic Party on Fair Deal Infrastructure. A Congressional debate brought up the idea of allowing a smaller community works to be paid by the government, with repair being handled by the Corvée system. The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour. This stand also puts pressure on Southern Democrats in his own party that support a state-financed and cheap reconstruction plan. National attention to the Corvée system has led to most states outlawing it."
ustates.182.a:0 "Rightfully So."

ustates.183.d:0 "Richard Russell's career in Georgia prior to the White House wasn't without its controversy. As a cost-cutting measure, Russell authorized the use of penal labour to undertake constructions for the state. This free labour was compounded by poor living conditions and has eventually come back to haunt Russell. A former prisoner who had his conviction overturned has written a book entitled 'I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!'. This book describes a corrupt penal system and puts the blame on now-President Russell. Those critical of the President are having a field day with this. Rumours of Hollywood planning a movie on this book have also circulated."

Gangsters, sent by the Dutch Schultz to avenge his upcoming execution tried shooting at him through the windows. Fortunately, the Secret Service was able to hide President Dewey, and nabbed the gangsters responsible. As a result, Dewey has doubled his security and pressed for further crackdowns nationwide on crime syndicates, as this attempt may encourage copycats. Both Democrat and Republican in Congress have called J Edgar Hoover into Congress to explain how the FBI did not see this coming. Many on the fence about Dewey are now glad their President has survived such a vile plot."

This is not an alliance, per se, but rather an association of countries in North and South America under American guidance and protection. They would guarantee our independence and offer us military and economic advisers, and in return we would provide them military access and preferential treatment for our exports. It is not a bad deal, though some suggest it ties us too closely to the Americans - and, considering our neutrality would be required, also prevents us from seeking alliances elsewhere. The question is, with the Americans protecting us, do we even need them?"

ustates.301.t:0 "Full Utilization of Force"
ustates.301.d:0 "The aftermath of the Second Civil War has given us time to assess not only the holes in our military capabilities, but potential improvements as well. Our General Staff has determined that we can outpace conventional engine based aeroplanes with the new fuel and thrust tech developed by Lawrence Bell. At the same time, we have procured enough engineers and scientists for Neddermeyer's idea for a plutonium gun nuclear weapon."

ustates.303.t:0 "Winchester Project"
ustates.303.d:0 "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"
ustates.303.a:0 "We are safe from Oppenheimer's deadly toy."

ustates.304.t:0 "The War and Peace Studies"
ustates.304.d:0 "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
ustates.304.a:0 "Constrained by diplomats no more."

ustates.305.t:0 "The White House and Xanadu"
ustates.305.d:0 "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
ustates.305.a:0 "We appreciate your support."

ustates.306.t:0 "The New Normal in America"
ustates.306.d:0 "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."
ustates.306.a:0 "Endorse the new supporters."
ustates.306.b:0 "Refuse this congressional oeuvre."

ustates.307.t:0 "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
ustates.307.d:0 "While the United States has an air force, the capability to defend the skies and project power, we do not have an Air Force. The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."

ustates.307.c:0 "The Air Force Belongs to itself."

ustates.308.t:0 "Super-weapons on a budget"
ustates.308.d:0 "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."
ustates.308.a:0 "Goddard's Rocket."

ustates.308.c:0 "Reich's Bomb."

ustates.309.t:0 "Goddard's Successful Launch"
ustates.309.d:0 "At home again in Roswell, New Mexico, Goddard again goes to launch test rockets. The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."
ustates.309.a:0 "Good boy Goddard."

ustates.310.t:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
ustates.310.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
ustates.310.a:0 "The breath goes now."

ustates.311.t:0 "Reich's Failed Explosion"
ustates.311.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."

ustates.500.t:0 "Garner-Wagner Bill Re-Introduced"
ustates.500.d:0 "With assurances made by President Hoover that, unlike in 1932, this time he will not veto the bill, Democratic Senator Robert Wagner and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner have re-introduced their unemployment relief legislation package. Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."
ustates.500.a:0 "We shall see"

ustates.501.t:0 "Long and Reed Demand Changes"
ustates.501.d:0 "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Jack Reed and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."
ustates.501.a:0 "Interesting"

ustates.502.t:0 "Senators Break Ranks"
ustates.502.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations, a number of establishment Senators have broken ranks over the coming vote on the Garner-Wagner Bill - most notably Robert Wagner, one of the bill's proposers, who says he will not vote for the bill unless protections for federal unemployment insurance are re-added. Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible. President Hoover will need to intervene in order to save the bill."
ustates.502.a:0 "Pledge support to Wagner and the establishment Senators"

ustates.502.c:0 "Force the establishment to compromise with the SPA"

ustates.503.t:0 "Long and Reed Furious"
ustates.503.d:0 "Both Huey Long's AFP and Jack Reed's SPA have reacted with fury at President Hoover's endorsement of establishment Senators. They have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner Bill, claiming that the public is being deceived by a 'corrupt government which refuses to recognize the reality of America'. While the parties have both gained a considerable boost in support from their base, Democratic and Republican fortunes have improved somewhat, and there is a feeling that both have a better chance going into the next election... provided the bill actually passes."
ustates.503.a:0 "Let's hope it does!"

ustates.504.t:0 "Compromise with the AFP"
ustates.504.d:0 "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the America First Party, with numerous extra provisions included for farm relief and unemployment protection - though nowhere near as far as the AFP originally demanded. Even so, Huey Long has declared this as a victory and is riding high in recent polls. Both Jack Reed's SPA and a large number of Republican Senators have declared this a betrayal of the American public, however, and have vowed to sink the Garner-Wagner bill when the vote comes."
ustates.504.a:0 "We've done what we can..."

ustates.505.t:0 "Compromise with the SPA"
ustates.505.d:0 "Recent days have resulted in a compromise between many establishment Senators and the Socialist Party of America, with numerous extra provisions included for worker protections and unemployment relief - though nowhere near as far as the SPA originally demanded.

ustates.507.t:0 "The Garner-Wagner Bill Passes!"
ustates.507.d:0 "Though the vote was incredibly close, the Garner-Wagner bill has passed Congress. People throughout the United States are celebrating this welcome relief to the country's disastrous economic situation, though many within the government are wondering: how will the bill now be paid for?"
ustates.507.a:0 "A victory for us all!"

ustates.508.t:0 "The Garner-Wagner Bill Fails!"
ustates.508.d:0 "After an incredibly close vote in Congress, the Garner-Wagner bill failed to pass. While several groups are declaring personal victory, protests have broken out in various parts of the country. There will be no relief for the American worker, and many have declared the government to be corrupt and dysfunctional. There will be considerable time for blame, but for the moment the Hoover government's concerns must turn to the growing violence throughout American cities - violence which is expected to only worsen in the months leading up to the election."
ustates.508.a:0 "All that for nothing..."

ustates.509.t:0 "War Plan White"
ustates.509.d:0 "The time has come to dust off one of the American military's colour-coded war plans, this one meant for dealing with domestic disturbances and insurgencies. It cannot come a moment too soon, as violence is escalating in areas where the AFP and the SPA have been contending with local authorities for dominance. Minnesota and North Carolina are the two states where the violence is at its height, and - at the moment - we can only focus our efforts in one place."

More focus needs to be put on strengthening the units we know are loyal. We also need to decide where to focus their deployment, for the time being."

General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas. Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the AFP and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."

ustates.512.t:0 "The Hawking Plan"
ustates.512.d:0 "Junior Democratic Senator Thomas Hawking has introduced a bill which will see the relief efforts largely funded by taxing American corporations - in exchange for hefty tax considerations down the line, once the economy has recovered. This has caused considerably controversy in some corners, especially among AFP and SPA supporters. Others say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolils or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are AFP and SPA strongholds."

ustates.513.d:0 "As an offshoot of the Hawking Plan, relief efforts will see new industrial growth in several vital areas - primarily in the military sector. Several of these new companies are planned for Denver, Colorado. At least one other area can be promoted, and the cabinet believes that putting them in depressed areas which are currently strongholds of the AFP or SPA may see their influence in those areas drastically weakened."

Both would mean a large number of jobs for the area, and would be a boon for our control over the region. The problem is that word of the contract has gotten out, and whichever city we *don't* choose will likely be enraged, giving strength to the AFP or the SPA in the region."

ustates.515.d:0 "It came as a surprise to the Canadian government, but the ambassador from [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded that the Canadian government immediately begin repaying the war debts incurred by the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has, to an extent, avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the debt... not all at once, at least. Though the old United Kingdom was on its way to repayment, there was a tacit agreement after the British Revolution that the debts wouldn't continue to be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."
ustates.515.a:0 "Whatever the reason, we cannot do as they demand"

ustates.516.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
ustates.516.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to the demand with a flat refusal. The debt, they say, was never meant to be repaid until the Home Islands were retaken - as most was incurred by the United Kingdom, a government which is now in exile. Even so, their refusal has done its job and fired up the isolationist elements of the American government. President Hoover's government has the support it needs, at the cost of relations with the Canadians."
ustates.516.a:0 "So be it"

ustates.517.t:0 "Compromise with America?"
ustates.517.d:0 "There has been a break in the chilly relations with the American government since their demand for debt repayment. They have approached us with an offer: economic assistance now, and an agreement to increase trade with the Entente, in exchange for the rest of the debt being delayed until the Home Isles are retaken... which was, aides point out, the original deal to begin with. It might be a way to restore goodwill with our southern neighbors, and even help them, though some are suggesting that there's no point in shoveling our limited funds into a bottomless pit. America is lost, they say, and we should look to our own first."
ustates.517.a:0 "We agree to the compromise"
ustates.517.b:0 "They are on their own"

ustates.518.t:0 "Canada Agrees to Compromise"
ustates.518.d:0 "The Canadian government has reluctantly agreed to the compromise, giving us what repayment they can now and accepting the deferment until the Home Isles have been retaken. In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all. The main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the AFP and the SPA, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."
ustates.518.a:0 "We'll take what we can get"

ustates.519.t:0 "Canada Refuses the Compromise"
ustates.519.d:0 "The Canadian government has refused our offer of compromise, leading to economic sanctions applied by both sides.

ustates.520.d:0 "In a fiery speech, President Long declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the SPA and its insidious influence over America. The ongoing New Year's Strike is its doing, and it is America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the SPA from Congress, and named the Minutemen as acting with emergency invested authority as executors of the president's will. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the SPA, many more are alarmed by President Long's use of executive power."

ustates.521.d:0 "In a fiery speech, President Reed declared that his intended reforms would have to wait - of far more pressing importance was the America First Party and its insidious influence over America. So long as the Minutemen milita run rampant, attacking strikers and innocent Americans alike, it will be America's number one public enemy. An executive order banned the AFP from Congress, and called on the SPA milita to act as emergency reinforcement to government forces. While some in the halls of power are relieved to see action being taken against the Minutemen, many more are alarmed by President Reed's use of executive power."

ustates.522.d:0 "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Minutemen and the America First Party, Jack Reed has passed an executive order that has declared them an illegal organization which seeks to overthrow the country, and as such all force shall be used to oppose them. Reed has drawn a direct comparison between the Minutemen and the terrorist attacks that occurred on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The Minutemen are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."
ustates.522.a:0 "Excellent!"

ustates.523.t:0 "Long Defies the Order"
ustates.523.d:0 "Huey Long publicly denounced Reed's executive order as being unconstitutional and an act meant to suppress opposition to his rule and pave the way for syndialist reforms in America. Long has organized large rallies and protests with the Minutemen there to keep the protesters safe from aggression. These highly reported-on protests have seen union strikers beaten by Minutemen without interference from the police, which calls into question Reed's ability to protect Americans."
ustates.523.a:0 "Rely on the police to keep control"

ustates.524.t:0 "Police Forces Defy Reed"
ustates.524.d:0 "In an unexpected move, the police have refused to enforce the various executive orders. Within Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, and other cities scattered throughout the American South, they have declared a Police Strike in solidarity with the AFP. While they worked to keep order, Police union leaders publicly declare that they would not follow the Laws of 'Reed the Tyrant'. Thus Reed has called in the US Army to enforce his laws."

ustates.525.t:0 "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
ustates.525.d:0 "When government foces, bolstered by SPA milita, arrived in the American South to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by Minutemen and supporters of the AFP. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Americna South. It has quickly noticed that the governmnet has no remaining authority there."

ustates.530.t:0 "An Envoy from the East"
ustates.530.d:0 "Ever since word arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] regarding General MacArthur willingly stepping down from power out east, we have wondered if we would hear from the new government. The ceasefire has held, after all - so do they desire peace? Our question has been answered with the arrival of an envoy from the Federal government. They wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Reed, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"

According to [From.GetNameDef], he is as much responsible for the death and destruction of the civil war as Reed and Long, and so long as he is not held to the same example as those men they cannot trust that our return to democracy is real. It could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us. To repay him this way seems almost unthinkable."

ustates.536.d.arrest:0 "With the restoration of democracy in the United States, the breakaway faction in the west evidently had no reason to continue the civil war. After several meetings between the two governments, the only condition imposed by Pacific States was that General Douglas MacArthur be arrested and tried for treason. According to American officials, the West considered MacArthur just as much a traitor as Huey Long and Jack Reed, and just as responsible for the death and destruction that ensued. Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin. It will likely take years for MacArthur's case to go to trial, and without a doubt will be a sensation, but for now the American Civil War is truly over."

ustates.600.t:0 "Status of the US Army"
ustates.600.d:0 "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with no tanks at all and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."
ustates.600.a:0 "They'll have to suffice"

ustates.601.t:0 "Status of the US Navy"
ustates.601.d:0 "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defence establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. New carriers have been commissioned, but they are nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm n the horizon."

Now not only is a reform plan to deal with the imminent crisis necessary, but also urgent as the rebellious states threaten the unity of America. Luckily for us, several staff members had already been advocating for reform plans since the early 1920s, and they have been summoned by High Command to a meeting for them to lay out their plans. After a session full of army formalities, 4-Star General Malin Craig presented a restructuring and mobilization plan which would focus on trying to arm as many men as possible while improving and enhancing the High Command to have an edge in planning over our enemies. While many conservative members applauded his traditionalist stance, Major General Adna R. Chaffee criticized his stance, quoting several instances in which planning and mass mobilization didn't earn the victory to the French in the Weltkrieg, and instead advocating for the adoption of the 'Thunderbolt': Fast moving armies supporting themselves on motorized and mechanized elements to quickly exploit enemy weak spots. While both sides got gridlocked into a discussion for radically different plans, Major General Leslie McNair offered an alternative solution: The American strength lies with its industry, and it is clear that in order to win, that strength should be exploited to its fullest. For that he proposes the restoration of the late 1920s and early 1930s artillery examination boards and the development of anti air and anti tank batteries to counter-act any enemy developments on this front.

However, air development during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, spark conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganize as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield. With the High Command being undecided on the issue, the final decision has been sent to the War Department, where it has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defence to decide on the matter."

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft.

Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation.

The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterized by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilized front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armored attacks. While officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."

In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the 'Armored Force Tentative Table of Organization' where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organization that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armored division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defence, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organization system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."

While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favorable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."

ustates.616.d:0 "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognized an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books. The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organizations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organizations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval. While our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."

ustates.617.d:0 "While the Victory Book Campaign has managed to pave the way for institutions like the Council on Books in Wartime and the War Book Panel, the Campaign itself is beginning to draw a lot of criticism from the Army. The Campaign was unfortunately not well suited for combat units, as the bulky hardcovers were found to be unsuitable for use in the field and many of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books. While the idea is still in the air, the Army has decided to order the VBC to come to a close, but has begun plans with the CBW to create a new plan to entertain our soldiers."

With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command. While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with 'Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'' should be discarded. Regardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."

While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe. However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests have proved not only that they were wrong, but we have paid the price dearly for it, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canadian put their snipers through in the weltkrieg."

First the military turned to the head of the Army’s Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell. He, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, which would house all the War Department's components. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cementery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropiate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accomodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

USA_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."

He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government.

There he'd serve as Aide-de-Camp for Brigadier General J.M. Bell and J.M. Lee for the remainder of the campaign, fulfilling several staff roles in the rear. He'd be transferred back to the US in 1904, and would serve as a staff member of the Texas Headquarters, until being promoted to Captain in 1906. He'd continue to fill a variety of staff roles while at the same time attending the Army Staff College and the Army War College, of which he graduated in 1909 and 1911 respectively. He took part in Pershing's punitive expedition, providing logistical support to Pershing, and earning him the promotion to major. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organizing the Bureau of the Budget in 1921, after which he was promoted to Brigadier General for his remarkable performance. He'd become Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War and was put in charge of the Industrial Preparedness sector, which got him his promotion to Major General. In 1934 he had a major fall out with General MacArthur that still causes tensions between the two until now.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong anti-immigrant and anti-semitic views both publicly and privately."
USA_GEORGE_PATTON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 11, 1885, in San Gabriel, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton has vocally opposed his colleague constantly. While his friend Eisenhower tends to mediate between the two, Patton has been forced by the general staff to remain as a lieutenant colonel despite having all the traits and qualifications of a brigadier general.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong racist views in public."
USA_ADNA_CHAFFEE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 23, 1884, in Junction City, Kansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Adna Romanza Chaffee Jr., the son of Major General Adna Romanza Chaffe Sr., graduated from West Point in 1906 as a Cavalry Lieutenant. His first tour of duty was with the 15th Cavalry as part of the Army of Cuban Pacification, where he proved to be an extremelly competent horseman (which shortly earned him the nickname 'The Army's Finest Horseman'). He was next assigned to the Mounted Services School at Fort Riley, Kansas between 1907 and 1911, where he commanded the mounted detachment serving the students and staff of the Army War College. He was then sent to France to attend the French Cavalry School at Saumur in 1913, as tensions began rising in Europe. In 1914 he returned to America to teach in Fort Riley for a short time, but was redeployed to the 7th Cavalry Regiment in the Philippines. He was reassigned in 1915 to the Staff and Faculty at West Point as the Senior Cavalry Instructor in the Tactical Department, where he remained until 1919, when he became an instructor at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. The next year, he achieved the rank of Major and was reassigned first to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and then to the 1st Cavalry Division in 1921. After attending the Army War College, he assumed command of a squadron of the 3rd Cavalry from 1925 to 1927, when he moved to the War Department's General Staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. In that post, he began working extensively on compiling the usage of Tanks in the Weltkrieg and developing America's first mechanized and armored tactics, despite having very few assets available to put his theory to the test. Chaffee left the General Staff in 1931 to serve as the Executive Officer of the newly formed 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Knox, which was planned to be reformed into a mechanized unit. Returning to Washington, D.C. and the War Department in 1934, Chaffee has served as the Chief of the Budget and Legislative Planning Branch and has reached the rank of Brigadier General in late 1935.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While held in very high regard by the Cavalry, the General Army staff disagrees with his unproven battle doctrines."

USA_FOX_CONNER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 2, 1874, in Slate Springs, Missippi, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of Confederate Soldier Robert Conner, Fox Conner joined West Point via congressional appointment in 1894 and graduated as Second Lieutenant in 1898, excelling in history, mathematics, horsemanship and French. Despite being a Cavalry enthusiast, he was assigned to the 1st Artillery Regiment, and he was denied several requests for transfer into the Cavalry branch. He was sent to Cuba in 1899, where he served with the occupation force following the Spanish-American War and met his future wife, Virginia Brandreth. He reached the rank of Captain in 1901, after which he was transferred to the 123rd Coast Artillery Company in Fort Hamilton, New York. He continued on his post until entering the Army Staff College in 1905 and the Army War College in 1907, from which he graduated in 1911. He was then sent abroad as a military attaché to the French 22nd Field Artillery Regiment. After returning to the US, he was assigned to the Artillery Batteries near the Mexican Border, where he was promoted to Major and assigned to the Inspector General's office in Washington D.C.. He remained in his post for the next few years, where his ability in French allowed him to translate many of the French reports on the battles of the Weltkrieg, earning him a promotion to Colonel in 1918 and later Brigadier General in 1920, and allowing him to meet the up-and-coming George C. Marshall in the War Department. He was then transferred to Fort Meade, where he was introduced to George S. Patton, quickly becoming friends and through which he was introduced to Eisenhower, both of which quickly became friends and seeming pupils of Conner. This would lead him to choose Eisenhower to follow him to Panama after being assigned to its garrison, and despite their disagreements on motorized divisions and the usage of tanks in modern war. He was promoted to Major General in 1925 and was proposed by Pershing for Chief of Staff in 1930, although he was ultimately passed on in favour of Douglas MacArthur. He has since then being assigned to the First Army, and he is known to maintain regular correspondence with Marshall, Patton and Eisenhower still.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Soon to retire from the Army."

### Parties ###
USA_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
USA_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (Vanguardist) - §LIn addition to its mainstream syndicalist wing, the SPA also has a wing containing various authoritarian-leaning syndicalists, marxists, and more. These so-called "Vanguardists" are a small but vocal minority within the party, and the party's detractors often point to them as a cause for alarm. However, this does a disservice to the faction's diversity. William Foster, identifying as a syndicalist but espousing quite authoritarian views, advocates for a social revolution as well as collectivization, and is generally seen as the most radical member of the SPA. Recently, he has even gone so far as to call more moderate members of his party "reactionaries". Earl Browder, once a close friend of Foster, has since distanced himself from syndicalism somewhat, supporting the retention of many old American institutions such as small businesses, while also being somewhat socially conservative. Known as a negotiator, his focus is on industry and the economy, and this may win him support from other SPA factions. Lesser-known James Burnham advocates a technocratic society, in which a new managerial class will inevitably rise to replace the old aristocratic classes. He represents the most conservative Vanguardists as well as various breakaways from other factions of the SPA.§!"
USA_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
USA_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (IWW) - §LThe Industrial Workers of the World was founded in 1905 in Chicago, Illinois. Its main founders were Eugene Debs, Bill Haywood, Mary Harris "Mother" Jones, and Daniel De Leon, among others. Their motto "an injury to one is an injury to all" can be seen as representative of their greater party goals, which are first and foremost advocation for greater worker's rights and a new union-oriented economy. Today, the IWW is one of the most important groups within the SPA, and some would argue that it makes up its mainstream, for this wing of the party is currently the most popular. This could easily change, however. Of course, within such a faction, there are sure to be disagreements. Those who adhere to the IWW message generally identify themselves as syndicalists or anarcho-syndicalists, though they have different visions for how they would run the country. Bill Haywood has united this faction for now, with hopes to bring radical changes to the United States. As a result of this and the recent strife in the country, the SPA has exploded in popularity. Their main base of support is in the Steel Belt, which is now popularly called the Red Belt for the popularity of the SPA in the region. Due to his broad support in this area and the relative disunity of other regions, some even theorize that Haywood could win it all in the coming election.§!"
USA_radical_socialist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
USA_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America (Independent) - §LThere are many leftists within the SPA who do not explicitly identify as syndicalists and have more moderate tendencies. This wing of the party is popularly called the "Nationalist" wing or the "Social Patriots". It traces some of its beliefs to author Edward Bellamy as well as old Nationalist Clubs. They are based more in social organizations than they are in unions, and this probably reflects their support among the middle-class rather than urban workers. The American Independence League is the strongest of these organizations, and with the other factions, they have differed from the syndicalists in their support for middle-class guilds, values of humanism, and a generally utopian vision for how American should be run. Norman Thomas is their main leader, inspired by the writings of Bellamy, though he is not alone in this faction of course. Overall though, their distinctiveness from other factions of the SPA makes them notable enough to be considered their own, and in some time, perhaps they will come to prominence within the party as a whole.§!"
USA_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
USA_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party -  §LProgressives in America have a long and proud history. For all their efforts though, they have little to show for it on the national stage. Theodore Roosevelt is pointed to as a main Progressive figure, yet his bid for the presidency in the Bull Moose Party was ultimately unsuccessful. Other Progressives have tried and failed to win the presidency in recent decades, most notably Wisconsin Progresive Robert M. La Folelette. Now, with the country at its breaking point, they may finally have a shot. George Norris, popularly known as the "Fighting Liberal", is quite powerful within the Progressive Party. His support of a "Fair Deal" in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt's old idea, as well as his populist appeals to farmers, have made him the likely nominee for the party in the coming election. While they represent a platform that is distasteful to most elites, some are beginning to wonder if they would be preferable to the extremists that plague the country, and see them as a party that could address the concerns of most voters while also keeping the peace.§!"
USA_social_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
USA_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party (Liberal) - §LThe Republican Party has experienced significant success since its inception in the days of Abraham Lincoln. The recent presidency of Woodrow Wilson has perhaps put a dent in this success, but the Republican Party still stands strong. However, the events of the past few years have endangered the continue dominance of the Republican Party, and although sitting President Herbert Hoover is himself a Republican, there is no guarantee the party will win the upcoming election. In fact, the party is somewhat split between different wings, particularly on the issue of trade: the more protectionist wing, represented by Hoover and his vice president, Charles Curtis, and the more socially focused and free-trade minded liberal wing, represented by rising star Alf Landon. Both sides believe in a stimulus program to get the country back on its feet, although notably, Curtis is more focused on this in his speeches, whereas Landon points to tariffs as the main culprit behind the economic crisis. Landon is in a tough spot: he has found it difficult to criticize the incumbent party, since it is his party, and any critique of them could turn into a critique of him. The best he can do now is try to defeat Curtis and move forward at the head of a revitalized Republican Party. Even if he succeeds however, he has daunting four years ahead of him...§!"
USA_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
USA_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party (Conservatives) - §LThe Republican Party has experienced significant success since its inception in the days of Abraham Lincoln. The recent presidency of Woodrow Wilson has perhaps put a dent in this success, but the Republican Party still stands strong. However, the events of the past few years have endangered the continue dominance of the Republican Party, and although sitting President Herbert Hoover is himself a Republican, there is no guarantee the party will win the upcoming election.

Both sides believe in a stimulus program to get the country back on its feet, although notably, Curtis is more focused on this in his speeches, whereas Landon points to tariffs as the main culprit behind the economic crisis. Curtis is well known and quite popular within insider circles, and his position as Hoover's vice president has won him more friends than one might expect. However, Hoover's record has put a bit of a splotch on Curtis's record, and he will have to work hard to shrug off a challenge to his left from Alf Landon in the party primary. If he can accomplish this though, his advisors are confident his hopeful message will beat the doom-and-gloom of Garner and the extremists that threaten to sap support from both major parties. But, Curtis himself wonders if he can accomplish a recovery where Hoover could not, and it is yet to be seen how he will differ in a significant way from his friend. Whispers of a new government intervenionism just around the corner have aroused anxiety in his advisors, yet his supporters have welcomed the rumors with significant enthusiasm, and perhaps this will be his path to victory.§!"
USA_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
USA_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - §LThe Democratic Party is old, yet Hoover's time in office has reinvigorated the party. Prominent Democrats see the current crisis as the perfect opportunity to regain the White House, yet they are not free from challenges. For all their faults, the Republican Party has remained a unified force in electoral politics. Meanwhile, an offshoot branch of the Democratic Party, led by "Alfala Bill" Murray, threatens to tear the Democratic Party in half. Their base in the South could all but cripple the Democrats in the popular vote, if not the electoral college as well. Worse, the Democrats have also suffered in traditionally friendly urban areas, like New York City, which have gone over to the Socialist Party of America. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner is not in the mood for negotiation. His platform is focused on decrying socialist radicals in the North, immigrants in the cities, and minorities in the South. The interventionist proposals of Curtis and Landon are anathema to Garner; he believes they would give too much ground to socialists and populists, as he says Hoover has in his time in office. He has deemed austerity the only solution to the nation's economic woes, noting that if the country tightened its belts, perhaps it could finally function. If he wants to win though, Garner will have to expand his base beyond its traditional supporters, or perhaps win back disaffected supporters who left with Murray. This will be no easy task, and Garner certainly has a hard task ahead of him. But, if he wins, Garner is confident that his hardline strategy towards extremists will ultimately save the country. His fellow house members hope he is right, for if he fails, the country will surely fall apart. For now, all eyes are on Garner.§!"
USA_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
USA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - §LThe America First Party is a new phenomenon in American politics, but in its short existence, it has managed to explode onto the political scene like a bomb. Louisiana Governor and now Senator Huey Long, known as the "Kingfish", has solidifed control over his state, and now has plans to run for president. He has sharply criticized President Hoover's attempts to ameliorate the crisis, instead advocating his own program of "Share Our Wealth". This program would limit personal net worth and yearly income, give old-age pensions to those over sixty years of age, work to guarantee free education for all, and redistribute wealth from the one percent to the rest of the population through taxes to pay for it. Long has already become a star in American political circles, and his speeches draw thousands of onlookers from Los Angeles to New York City. His greatest support has come in the Great Plains, the birthplace of Populism. Farmers and workers alike in this region, dealing with the brunt of the Dust Bowl crisis, have flocked to Long. However, his support is not limited to these states, and Long has enough support to potentially even win the upcoming election, assuming his anti-establishment message can sap enough support from the major parties and new party challengers. Should Long be elected though, he will face significant challenges. For one, opposition from the establishment would be rather strong, and Hoover has barely even acknowledged the AFP's existence. Further, should Long win, it is almost certain the result would be denounced as illegitimate by other parties, and this could cause conflict. Whatever happens though, the Kingfish and his AFP are ready, and anyone who underestimates them would be making a grave mistake.§!"
USA_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Old Democratic Party"
USA_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party - §LDuring the Red Scare in President Woodrow Wilson's administration, syndicalists and other leftists were suppressed. However, the Republicans eased this pressure, and these groups have swelled in popularity once again. The Democrats, for their part, have done little to oppose this, and it seems that they are too weak, too corrupt, or both to deal with it. As such, former Oklahoma Governor "Alfalfa" Bill Murray has decided to lead anxious Dixiecrats to a new party, called the Old Democratic Party due to its espousal of older Democratic Party values. He has even decided to run for president with the motto of fighting "Communists, Corporations and Miscegenation". Murray's fiery speeches denouncing banks and political corruption have won him significant support in the South, but he has not accomplished this alone. The Ku Klux Klan, working in conjunction with the NDWL, has become a major force within the party, and have brought in more support than Murray had ever dreamed of. There are also the corporatist Fordists, who have given Murray a base outside the South as well, mainly among disaffected Democrats and Republicans in Northern cities. For now, these factions are unified under Murray's leadership, but if he wins the election, there is sure to be tension. These are the least of his worries though, as the ODP has even been ignored by some Southern congressmen, and they are rarely taken seriously on the national stage. Further, if the party can win in 1936, it is certain that there will be challenges to the ODP's leadership, and the situation might lead to armed conflict. Regardless, Murray is certain that the current system is failing, and he believes he is the only one who can save the country from itself.§!"
USA_national_populist_party:0 "Old Democratic Party"
USA_national_populist_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party (National White League) - §LThe National Democratic White League is one of the foremost factions of the Old Democratic Party. Their power emerged during the recent growth of Ku Klux Klan membership, and now they have millions of members across the country, ready to fight if need be. The NDWL generally supports an anti-syndicalist, anti-Black, and anti-Semitic platform that is more harsh in nature than the mainstream ODP platform. As such, they are often used to attack the ODP as far-right extremists, though this does not account for the diversity within the NDWL itself. The Young Klan is the newer of the two Klan factions, and it aims to modernize the organization, present itself as moderate and diplomatic, and appeal to groups the Klan failed to appeal to in the past. The Old Klan, modeled after the original Ku Klux Klan, has worked with the Black Legion and is generally seen as the more brutal of the two Klan factions, but also less aristocratic than its Young Klan counterpart. Meanwhile, Herbert Armstrong leads the fringes of the NDWL, under a unique movement of "Christian Identity". Armstrong draws significantly on the Bible and Christianity to justify the extreme positions he advocates, and he has his own vision for how America should be run.§!"

Few expected this after America successfully avoided the Weltkrieg but the rise of syndicalism fomented a Red Scare and an economy depressed by nonstop worker strikes and political crackdowns. Herbert Hoover won the 1928 election promising a return to normalcy but with the Great Panic of 1928 occurring he has made no headway and his re-election via the House of Representatives has only damaged his legitimacy. Now US politics is challenged by numerous radical forces, all of whom promise in their own way an end to politics as we know it if elected."

### Leader Bios ###
## United States of America ##
POLITICS_RONALD_REAGAN_DESC:0 "Growing up and out of the rural reaches of Illinois, Ronald Reagan had first caught the public’s eye with his soothing voice and witty personality, culminating in a uniquely charismatic figure that many Americans would tune in to listen time to time. Not soon after the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, Reagan would find himself day by day at the front end of the microphone, broadcasting to the loyal men and women of the United States and offering a source of comfort to the soldiers on the federal frontlines. In such little time the radio star’s popularity skyrocketed, and after the war had ended he would ride his fame all the way to the Oval Office, as a ‘man of the people’, and a stalwart reminder of the United State’s perseverance against extremism. "
POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "A writer, a trade union leader, a Senator, a journalist and a Syndicalist - John 'Jack' Reed is many things. After the death of his predecessor, Alexander Berkman, this fiery radical socialist took the reins of the American syndicalist movement, and he has led this organisation to great success. While this long path from journalist to President has brought him many enemies, it also brought him many allies. He is determined to become the American version of Sebastian Faure, the founder of the Commune of France - a charismatic, unifying Syndicalist demagogue who shall turn his country into what he perceives to be a perfect society."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas and the new President of the United States. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. However, before becoming president, he was best known as an engineer, businessman, and the man in charge of the 'Commission for Relief' in Flanders-Wallonia. In addition to that record, he is also known for his two failed attempts to become the Republican nominee for President, losing once in 1920 to Leonard Wood and again in 1924 to Irvine Lenroot. Both Republicans would go on to lose their races, to Woodrow Wilson and A. Mitchell Palmer respectively. Hoover became the Republican nominee in 1928 as a compromise candidate between the Conservatives and Liberals within the party. With Hoover's victory in the 1928 Election, Republicans celebrated their victory, but their cheers would not last. As the United States was still in an economic slump, and began experiencing a major environmental catastrophy, that was and still is destroying the American farming industry. Part of Hoover's 28' campaign was the re-legalization of the SPA party, however, ever since the SPA entered into American political society, the growth of worker strikes (heavily linked to the SPA) and failures of negiotation have seen America's industry slow to a grinding halt. Hoover's policies of actively intervening in the economy and increasing the national debt has brought little success in improving the situtation overall. His victory in 1932 saw little celebrations as it was decided by a House vote, and this has made him quite possibly the most despised man in America. Everyone from Democrats to the ODP, SPA, and AFP are now calling him 'The Failed Humanitarian.'"
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_2_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States. With his suprise victory in the 1936 election, he has become the second president in the 20th Century to break the tradtional two terms of the Presidency. Hoover now stands guard over a nation on the brink of another Civil War. Despite all the economic interventionism that Hoover made over the last two terms, it has not done much for the United States. According to some, including his new vice president, it actually made the problem worse. Hoover now acknowledges the dangerous position the country is in and has begun to listen to his advisors such as Vice President Knox, his new cabinet, General Douglas MacArthur, and Director J. Edgar Hoover to help him solve the various economic, societal and political crisises that now plague the United States of America."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_3_DESC:0 "Herbert Clark Hoover is the 30th President of the United States, and is the second president in the 20th Century to have three terms in office. Many thought that when Hoover won in 1936, the United States would be forever destroyed, and throughout his term it looked like it was inevitable at various points. However, the important thing to many Americans at the end of the day is that it didn't occur. Hoover has gone from the most liked to the most hated and then back to the most liked politican and president in recent American memory. With the failures of his previous terms long gone, along with many of the problems facing America throughout the 30s, President Hoover and his cabinet look to the future of what this great nation can accomblish with his remaining time in office. These past three terms have aged Hoover to such a degree that the term of adorement used by the public to describe Hoover is 'The Grand Old Man.'"
POLITICS_FRANK_KNOX_DESC:0 "William Franklin Knox is now the President of the United States. Knox is known for his service to the United States during the Spanish-American War, where he served in the Rough Riders under former President Theodore Roosevelt. Along with his service to the United States, Knox also became quite renowed for owning and operating several newspapers across the Midwest. Frank Knox is now in the most powerful position in America, and as a staunch internationalist and anti-isolationist, he will atempt to prepare the United States for whatever may come next, opposed to what previous administrations have done over the past 30 years."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Son of Lieutenant general and civil war veteran Arthur MacArthur, young Douglas was prepared from an early life for military service. Instilled with a concern for the common man out west, and a hatred for former Confederates due to harassment in West Point, Douglas became a fine soldier. After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_TWO_DESC:0 "Son of Lieutenant general and civil war veteran Arthur MacArthur, young Douglas was prepared from an early life for military service. Instilled with a concern for the common man out west, and a hatred for former Confederates due to harassment in West Point, Douglas became a fine soldier. After serving in the Philippines, diplomatic posts in Japan, and defusing potential war in Mexico, MacArthur became Field Marshall of the Philippine Army. The strategic importance of the Philippines introduced MacArthur to Washington politics, and his set of allies and rivals. Although he adamantly denies being a politician, he has a good relationship with Hoover, conservative Democrats, and William Hearst. Despite his occasional admiration of populist James Coxey, MacArthur is willing to use deadly force against socialists, southern populists, and the forces that perpetuate political gridlock in Washington and elsewhere. This is a fact his men have learned and his enemies have learned even more so in recent times, but with the US defeated in the East, now only the Western Command Center remains. MacArthur has fled West and he seems to be a changed man, a new gleam in his eye. His anger and ultranationalism have only increased as a result of his loss in the East and he is now determined to win the war, whatever it takes..."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_D_LEAHY_DESC:0 "William Daniel Leahy, born in 1875 and growing up in the Midwest, may seem out of place in a nation of radicals, revolutionaries, and tyrants. However, as Leahy ambitiously climbed the ranks of the U.S. Navy, he always remained loyal to his country first and foremost. Like his fellow military men, Leahy was troubled by the growing chaos in the United States, and when Douglas MacArthur couped the government, Leahy was silent. As MacArthur began to crack down on both Congress and the U.S. Navy, however, enforcing his will on both groups, Leahy became more and more disenchanted with the American Caesar. When circumstances spiraled out of control, with MacArthur's actions threatening the war effort, Leahy decided it was time to take action. Now, in the aftermath of the navy coup, Leahy leads a fractured government and a broken people in what seems like an unwinnable conflict. Despite this, Leahy has friends, both in Washington and in the West, and his committment to democracy has soothed many who originally felt alienated by MacArthur's leadership. With grim determination and a sharp mind, Leahy will do whatever he must to restore democracy to his battered country."
POLITICS_ERNEST_J_KING_DESC:0 "When Douglas MacArthur took power in Washington, he did not anticipate the danger that an admiral could pose, and yet Admiral Ernest Joseph King has proved to be the cause of MacArthur's demise. King, a brilliant yet arrogant man with a love for the sea and the air alike, has had a remarkable few years. It seemed that his career would be fairly unremarkable until, in the mid-1930's, King was promoted along with many other officers in an effort to help deal with the growing extremist movements in the country. However, King, believing democracy itself to be the cause of the nation's woes, sided with MacArthur when the man came to power. When MacArthur began to lord over the U.S. Navy and worse, King himself, it was a step too far. Believing that MacArthur was neglecting the navy to the detriment of the war effort, and resenting the control of an army man, King led a coup against the government. Now that he runs the country, King has many plans. First and foremost, a significant investment in the U.S. Navy is just what King believes is needed to win the war. When that is done, though, King has further plans for America. Most of all, he wishes to see America take its rightful place in the world, and to do so, he is more than willing to step on potential rivals, especially the scheming remnants of the old Entente..."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "In a world where politics is largely defined by strict ideological lines, one might think that a man like Huey Long has no place in it, yet it is the opposite that he has proven through his career.\n\nBorn in a small village in North Louisiana, Long was exposed to poverty and precariousness from an early age. He showed it after his election as governor of his state, always putting the interests of the poorest Americans before himself through numerous social programs, and for that he did not hesitate to use the big means when the situation required it. However, he was greatly opposed by the Establishment, who called him a dangerous demagogic, authoritarian and corrupt populist. This led the so-called 'Kingfish' to found his own party, the America First Party, a populist, patriotic party based on pragmatism with the main proposed social measure being the extensive 'Share Our Wealth' program. This party does not fit into a traditional classification system, bringing together center-left progressives as well as right-wing Christian populist conservatives, all united by their loyalty to Kingfish and their disdain for socialists who they consider to be far from the spirit of America.\n\nAccompanied by loyal 'Minutemen' and the poor of America, leading a grand alliance of populists and sitting on a huge political machine encompassing the entire Midwest, the Kingfish is determined to shape America and democracy in his own image, no matter what the cost may be."
POLITICS_HUEY_LONGDONG_DESC:0 "Huey Long barely escaped capture when the American Union State fell. Only our quick action was able to save him. Not content to disappear into the dust bin of history, he has now shown up in our capital promising to use his political talent and charisma to keep the Progressive Party in power for a decade or more. He has renounced many of his previous beliefs in favor of a more mainstream Progressive platform, though he insists on keeping his "Share the Wealth" program. His promise is quite alluring and his prowess is obvious, though we must keep a close eye on him..."
POLITICS_FLOYD_OLSON_DESC:0 "Despite his rural upbringing, Floyd Olson has been able to see the great diversity in America through travel and activism.Working as a Shabbos goy, an IWW stevedore, and finally an attorney pushed Olson towards Progressivism in the 1920s. Olson joined up with Robert LaFollete’s Progressive Party following the 1924 election. Olson worked tirelessly for the next decade in order to gain allies for the Progressive Party, stopping only to seek treatment for his stomach ulcers in 1930. A surprisingly influential Governor of Minnesota and a national advocate for peace catapulted him into the White House on a bipartisan ticket against radicalism."
POLITICS_QUENTIN_ROOSEVELT_DESC:0 "The youngest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt, Quentin's early life was groomed for political activism in his father's Republican Party. Quentin, however, wished to be a pilot, and was injured in his training in 1918. Seeing his family and country being torn apart in recent years, Quentin pushed into politics and served as New York's Senator during the fateful year of 1936. Now that the great national disaster is over, Quentin's plan to follow in his father's footsteps and push for a new American Fair Deal."
POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC:0 "As Herbert Hoover's vice president, Charles Curtis is one of the most recognizable faces in America. His protectionism and moderation on social issues would have made him a more than acceptable choice in normal times, but these are not normal times. Regardless, as the times have changed, so too has Charles Curtis, and he has emerged with a plan to address the crises facing the country. Now that he is president, Curtis will attempt to both continue Hoover's legacy and implement "Home Rule Negotiations" in an attempt to solve the political crisis. On the economic front, new tariffs and a work sharing plan are what Curtis believes the country needs to get back on track. His status as the nation's first Native American president and his poor health alike have been largely ignored, with attention instead being placed on his economic plans. The people cry out for help, and if Curtis is unable to address their concerns, the country will suffer greatly. However, if Curtis does succeed in restoring order, he will usher in a new era of prosperity that will redeem the Republican Party and enshrine him as one of America's all-time greatest presidents."
POLITICS_ALF_LANDON_DESC:0 "Alf Landon was a successful entrepreneur in the oil business long before his entry into politics. This self-starter led to the creation of the United States Oil and Gas Association, a lobbying group associated with Standard Oil that Landon remains attached to this day. What initially seemed like a poor decision to break with Hoover's non-intervnetionalist position at the 11th hour before election day turned to his advantage when the Republican Party came with him. Even Hoover has begrudgingly come to endorse Landon, despite this personal betrayal of confidence. Now despite his humble demeanour Landon has proven to be the soft voice of confident economic recovery that America wanted. Although his strong ties with the oil lobby makes him an enemy of both socialists and Longists."
POLITICS_WENDELL_WILLKIE_DESC:0 "Wendell Willkie has been many things in his life before presidency. He began as a William Jennings fan, a populist-minded Democrat. He became a socialist in college, and rumors persist that he seduced Soong Mei Ling during a diplomatic visit to China in 1933. Not to mention an affair with writer Irita Van Doren. He continued to stand out when he opposed Democrats to push for a bank holiday when the Great Depression hit. This support for financial institutions and his assertions that government aid should not interfere with market competition made the difference in his election campaign. There is also his support for integrating the civil service and armed forces, which has put him at odds with many other Democrats. It remains to be seen whether this multitalented man can handle the many roles of the presidency."
POLITICS_HARRY_BYRD_DESC:0 "Whereas many southern populists fell to Huey Long's charms and deserted the Democratic Party, Harry F. Byrd stood his ground. Harry Byrd was born into a Virginian Brahmin family with a direct line to the American Revolution. A firm believer in segregation and fiscally conservative policies intended to reduce the national debt. Holding firm to his anti-Keynesian policies, Harry Byrd won as the stabilizing image of American traditional establishment."
POLITICS_PHILIP_FOLLETTE_DESC:0 "A professional Wisconsin progressive, Philip is the most successful of the politically active La Follette family. A friend and former mentor to Floyd Olson, who had been convinced to join the Farmer Labor Party in order to continue to help his state in need. With the spectre of isolationism that Philip's father Robert stood for, Philip nonetheless stands behind the need for a strong military in the Americas as well as the full extent and strength of the government as promoted by the Farmer Labor Party."
POLITICS_HENRY_WALLLACE_DESC:0 "Humble beginnings as an Iowa farmer did not dissuade a young Henry Wallace from seeing the world and gaining worldly insight. His fortune came from inventing hybrid corn breeds, a major innovation that allowed Wallace him travel the world. Henry visited India and became acquainted with Theosophy, a Hinduist school of thought popular in Russia that draws elements from Christian Anarchism and Socialism. These teachings ultimately alienated him from mainstream socialism and pushed him into the Farmer Labor Party when he returned. Wallace portrays himself above all else a pragmatic economist and an agricultural expert capable of the agrarian reform America needs."
POLITICS_JAMES_MURRAY_DESC:0 "A great controversy surrounded the election of James E. Murray during his election campaign. Tabloids and Republicans all came at Murray claiming that he cannot run for President due to being born in Canada. The truth of these statements may never be known, but his life prior to attending NYU is shrouded in mystery. His life began in earnest when Murray won the Governorship of Montana in 1933. His term as a Democrat was marked by an unusually cooperate relationship with unions and his bold belief that economic reform must disrupt a market if the market is failing."
POLITICS_ALBEN_BARKLEY_DESC:0 "Alben draws from over thirty years of political experience within the Democrat party and his own smart judgement. While Alben supported Wilson's reforms, he opposed McAdoo's attempts to reverse those policies. After several failed national election bids and a steady voting record, Alben was the right piece on the chess board in this election to gain the White House for the Democrats."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "The final ascent into the White House by Richard Russell Jr. is the final stroke in a long game that extends even before his time in the Democrat party. Russell Jr. has accumulated the right combination of titles in the US Navy, in the Georgian House of Representatives, and the US Congress to secure universal respect. His focus that de-segregation should happen entirely on southern terms proved popular with a national audience. Time will tell whether this position is sustainable."
POLITICS_GLEN_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Being President was just as much a surprise to Glen Taylor as it was to the voting public. The man that had wanted at one point to be a wandering preacher and then a country singer had finally reached a position that befitted his skills. Taylor was known in Congress as a compassionate economist and advocate of progressive policies and singing to children on the steps of the Capitol. Taylor's compassion fuled his opposition to segregation, and despite his eccentricities he has endeared himself to the American people, which is all he ever wanted."
POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "Dewey the natural born leader and politician that made it in New York despite his Michigan upbringing. Dewey has continuously proven his assertions correct, including predicting a war in Europe, Asia, and the Americas in the 1930s. His assertions that the New Deal wouldn't be owed entirely to the Republicans was also proven correct. Dewey campaigned under 'Compassionate Capitalism' and tried to distance the reforms from being necessarily welfare. Finally, Dewey's bold prediction that he would win the election came true."
POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC:0 "Young Earl Warren thought his career was doomed when his father Mathias was blacklisted for joining a strike, but instead it motivated the young man into excelling past this stigma. This prior stigma motivated Earl into joining numerous fraternities and lodges in order to intermingle with the people that stigmatized his father, as well as serving in the military. These connections paid off and sent Earl into a life of public service and eventually reached the Governor seat of California in 1932, where he steered the declining Progressive movement towards the political centre away from the even more declining West Coast Socialist Party. Earl became a progressive entryist within the Republican party, pushing for national desegregation."
POLITICS_CHARLES_MCNARY_DESC:0 "Charles McNary stood behind the foundation of the Republican party when it was under attack from all angles in 1936. A Progressive at heart but also a pragmatist, McNary was seen within the party as an insurance against the Northwest descending into radicalism, which also made him allies with an ally of Entente interests in North America. In fact, his company provided electricity to a significant portion of Western Canada by the 1940s due to this relationship."
POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "Harry Truman's dream of glory in war was dashed when the UC choose to prolong their neutrality during the Weltkrieg. Truman had dropped his college and law degree to prepare himself for the conflict that never came. Continued active service in Central America informed him of the threats of insurgent guerilla warfare. Truman brought this this discipline in the face of chaotic warfare back to Missouri and helped the state as Senator relieve towns that were struck by the chaos of 1936. For this Truman was promoted within the Democratic Party, and supported the New Deal legislation. Most strikingly was his push against the conservatives in favour of military desegregation."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Coming from a prominent business family with ties to international trade, William Harriman was able to establish several successful businesses in New York and became an important player in interstate trade. As the federal government has jurisdiction over those transactions, Harriman joined the Department of Commerce. A tactical minded approach to foreign policy and the goal of promoting America's ideology against the radicals that threatened her abroad resonated with Americans and pushed his career upwards."
POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "The decision by Strom to turn the Conservative Manifesto into a raison d’état for the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party was a risky move. Strom had spent decades within the Democratic Party attempting to oppose the overreaching powers of the Federal Government, and ensuring that the party never officially endorse desegregation. This gamble has now paid off as Strom Thurmond has been elected President."
POLITICS_HAPPY_CHANDLER_DESC:0 "The turning point in Happy Chandler's career came during his intermission in politics to become the Commissioner of Baseball. A term as Governor had established Chandler as a respectable and industrious Democrat with a firm hand on the party line. This stint as Commissioner of Baseball saw a historical decision to allow integrated baseball teams, which led to the end of segregated baseball. This only further elevated Chandler as a Senator and made his decision to carry this support into the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party even more important. His insistence that fiscal conservatism and the race question were not tied together stood against Strom Thurmond's line..."
POLITICS_JOHN_BRICKER_DESC:0 "An advocate for limited executive power and a non-interventionist interpretation, John Bricker is as old fashioned a Republican as they come. Bricker's career prior to his presidency was that of a rabble raiser and dissenter within the Republican Party railing against suspected socialist sympathizers and opposing the use of executive power to push economic reform. The country as a whole having come close to populist or authoritarian dictatorships just a few years prior."
POLITICS_HAROLD_STASSEN_DESC:0 "While the senior Republican Party leadership like Willkie and Dewey had preoccupied the 1930s with the minutia of the 1936 crisis, Harold Stassen was serving in the US Navy and being exposed into the wider world. An important lesson learned is the importance of international cooperation as opposed to the tariffs that his fellow Republicans were pushing for. A firm opponent of international syndicalism, Stassen believes that laissez faire economic policies must be replaced by strategic economic cooperation There is no need to hold onto undemocratic institutions such as segregation which only feeds syndicalist arguments."
POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "A student of warfare in the famous Class of 1915, Eisenhower's initial enthusiasm for testing new military doctrines vanished in Central America, as generals there failed to win against poorly trained insurgencies. While others in this class fell to either the urge for dictatorship or radicalism. Eisenhower stood firm with the Federal government and tried to stay out of civilian politics. Quoted as saying that he wouldn’t want to any politician, from 'dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe' Four years after he made that statement, Eisenhower was being sworn in as President. This came from a national acceptance for the desegregation of the military Eisenhower oversaw."
POLITICS_ADLAI_STEVENSON_DESC:0 "The reputation of Adlai Stevenson's father, that of an isolationist, dogged Adlai Stevenson II well into his political career. This position among the Democrats was put to the test with the American First Party, which depleted the party rank. Adlai stood to his roots during this most contentious time and persevered. As Governor of Illinois Adlai reformed the police force to be less at odds with socialists and even defended their rights to organize in the face of the Red Scare. Most doubted Adlai's ability to win against the respected General Eisenhower, but through an in kind appreciation from socialist voters Adlai won in the end."
POLITICS_JOHN_SPARKMAN_DESC:0 "Born in a log cabin and raised on a farm, John Sparkman had a very relatable upbringing. A rapidly ascending legal career and political clubs later and Sparkman had become the Democratic Representative for Huntsville. His victory being especially important in the fateful Year of 36 as he beat the AFP's candidate. Sparkman was instrumental in opening education up to immigrants and women in the South. Silent on social matters and bolstered by his support of science education, Sparkman spoke out against defensive US foreign policy, and eventually left for the Constitution Party, where his reputation put him on the fast track to presidency."
POLITICS_WARREN_HARDING_DESC:0 "Warren Gamaliel Harding may not have the right profile for the presidency, but that hasn't stopped him from reaching that position.\n\nHarding may seem like a typical Republican at first glance, extolling the virtues of small government and the classic free market economy, but it would be foolish to limit him to that. He first became known in his home state of Ohio for his outspoken rejection of political machines, his generally more progressive views than the average conservative Republican, and his natural charisma, with Harry M. Daugherty, then U.S. Attorney General, even saying of Harding that ‘He looked like a President’. Harding, as a Senator from Ohio, championed opposition to the Socialist Party of America in his home state as socialist ideals advanced greatly in popularity there.\n\nUnfortunately, no one is perfect, and one of Harding's hallmarks is the proliferation of scandals of all kinds, from extramarital affairs to political shenanigans by his allies. Still, Warren's popularity as president is high, and he intends to use the powers of the presidency to ensure the preservation of democracy and of the American Dream."
POLITICS_JAMES_EASTLAND_DESC:0 "Son of the Mississippi Delta District Attorney, James Eastland was sidetracked from politics for the first three decades in order to run a plantation. An advocate of sharecropping who profited from their work until his plantation quadrupled in size. Eastland stood up in the Senatorial race against the Klan's candidate, and won. Against the Conservative Coalition, Eastman supported the Fair Deal legislation in his home state while voting for it in Congress. As his reputation and passage into the Constitution Party carried much weight, he successfully lead many Democratic voters to his campaign as the closest thing the party could offer to a national candidate."

POLITICS_WARROOM_DESC:0 ""Gentlemen! You can't fight in here, this is the war room!"\n\nWith the collapse of D.C., a council of generals had to be hastily assembled in order to maintain some semblance of order within the military. However, with constant conflicting directions and a bloated bureaucracy, the military and governance are disorganized and remain ineffecient."

POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_DESC:0 "Earl Kemp Long, born in 1895, is the younger brother of the late rebel leader Huey Long. Continuing in his brother's footsteps, Earl is a progressive reformer who campaigned in dixie on a ticket of expanded school lunches, public works, and minoritiy rights. Many devotee's of Huey's brother herald him as a true heir that will finish what his brother started. Others however say that Longisim is what lost the the war against the Federals to begin with. Either way, Earl Kemp Long's political future will continue to be defined by the legacy of Huey, unless he can forge his name as a polical force in its own right."
POLITICS_FRANCIS_BLAIR_LEE_III_DESC:0 "Francis Preston Blair Lee III, born in 1916, was a member of the Lee family, a major historical political family in American history. His father was a major force in Maryland politics, and he is a direct desendant of a founder of the Declaration of Independence. Lee made a name for himself during the Third American Revolution, fighting bravely against the Syndicalists in battles along the Kentucky and Tennessee borders. His administration promises to be somewhat-progressive, but to also fight for 'Dixie Values and Dixie People.' Lee is keeping his family tradition alive."

POLITICS_LOVECRAFT_DESC:0 "H.P. Lovecraft, born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and controversial figures of the 20th century. His father dying when he was 8, his mother dying of the Spanish Flu in late 1918, and Lovecraft suffering from a plethora of health issues his entire life have led Lovecraft into a search for truth and deep meaning, which he channeled into his writings. Tales of darkness and horror within resonated strongly with an America reeling from the 1925 market crash. Lovecraft's science fiction gained him a serious audience for his thoughts on politics and philosophy. He rapidly gained an almost cult-like status in his home state of Rhode Island and drew many followers, preaching a dark and otherworldly message about supernatural powers and eldritch beings that are incomprehensible to the human mind. As president of the New England Literary Society, Lovecraft standardized the use of the English language in print, removing what he called 'Americanisms'. When he traveled to England in 1924 to study the English language and attempt to purify it as much as possible, he witnessed the 1925 uprising and grew an acute hatred of Syndicalism. He returned to America in 1930, founded his own newspaper and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rhode Island. He remained a prominent thought leader and a powerful influence on the minds of New Englanders, although his opponents accuse Lovecraft of being a dangerous man with authoritarian and occultist inclinations."
POLITICS_BAXTER_DESC:0 "Baxter was born into a wealthy family in Portland, Maine where his father James Phinney Baxter served six terms as mayor and had made his fortune in the canning industry. He earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1901. He was a freind to the Canadian government, and a popular governer of Maine, when King Edward VIII decided to put him in charge of the newly created New England Protectorate. He is to protect its people and ensure their loyalty to the crown."

POLITICS_WILD_BILL_DESC:0 "William Joseph 'Wild Bill' Donovan was born in Buffalo, New York, and studied law at Columbia university. He served under General Pershing in the Mexican campaign and then under General MacArthur as a Colonel in the 42nd division.  During the 2nd American Civil War, Donovan remained loyal to America and fought with distinction against both the Syndicalists and the Longists in their final battles. During the war, Donovan was appointed by MacArthur to America's quasi inteligence service the Black Chamber, who's code breaking resulted in the capture of several important rebel figures. Now, ever loyal Donovan leads the last remnants of America's leadership in their Washington stronghold. God bless the Enclave. God bless America."
POLITICS_MACARTHUR_IV_DESC:0 "Arthur MacArthur IV, born February 21, 1938, is the only child of Douglas MacArthur and is the rightful heir to our great Caesar. While the boy is obviously too young to properly rule, he has been given the official title as head of state by Loyalists who wish to continue MacArthur's line. As the son of the Great American Unifier, there are high expectations for the young MacArthur. Whether they will be fulfilled remains to be seen."

POLITICS_FORD_DESC:0 "Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in Greenfield Township, Michigan. An entrepreneur and a business man, his Ford Motor Company was highly successful, bringing the automobile into most people's lives for the first time. By 1936, Ford had built such a power base that the syndicalist uprising failed to kill him or significantly damage his business, and much of Ford's equipment would help General MacArthur. After the American Collapse, Ford and his company seized power over the Great Lakes, where his powerbase was concentrated. Now, Henry Ford is the absolute ruler of a great portion of America, and his company has complete ownership of the old Syndicalist heartland."

POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC:0 "The Vice President of the Hoover administration, Curtis is the voice of compromise and reform in the American government. The first President of Native American ancestry, he serves as an effective rallying point for racial justice and brings an affable face and new commitment to American values of liberty and freedom for all men, although many wonder if he can settle the coming conflict."
POLITICS_BIG_BILL_HAYWOOD_DESC:0 "If there ever was a man to represent the power of the working class, it would be William Haywood. Haywood has seen all corners of the country and lived alongside the working man. Haywood opposed Craft Unionism, which he felt could be divided and conquered by Capital. Instead founding one union, the International Workers of the World, meant to represent all working interests.  As the founder of the IWW, 'Big Bill' has battled the enemies of the people throughout his life: The capitalist opportunists, the labor slavehandlers, and even agents of the government. Quick to anger and unafraid of action, Haywood is the Man for Labor and the Man for America."

POLITICS_INNSMOUTH_DESC:0 "Charles Dern is a progressive businessman and the former head of the America First Party in Utah. Born in 1872 in Nebraska, Dern settled in Utah to found a successful ironworks company. After becoming disillusioned with the Democratic Party, Dern took inspiration from the reformist policies of Louisiana's Huey Long, eventually joining the America First Party. Dern ran unsuccessfully on a progressive platform for governor and broke all ties with the AFP after the American Union State rose into full rebellion. During the Civil War, Dern supported the legitimate government, and after the Collapse ran on a platform of peace and welfare. Tired and war-weary, the people of Utah have voted in Dern to implement his progressive reforms and lead Utah down a kinder, gentler road."
POLITICS_THEREWILLBEBLOOD_DESC:0 "Henry Hooper Blood was born October 1st 1872, in Kaysville, Utah Territory. A prominent businessman, he successfully ran for governor of the state of Utah in 1933. A key civilian figure within the MacArthur regime, Blood has managed to bring his state beyond the quasi-independent status it enjoyed before 1857. Only time will tell whether this fledgling nation's independence will be more secure than the last."
POLITICS_EZRABENSON_DESC:0 "Benson was born into a Mormon family in 1899 on a farm in Whitney, Idaho, and would be called to become a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles in 1939. After getting special permission, he was allowed to serve as both an a apostle and a member of the cabinet, where he served as Secretary of Agriculture for the wartime administration. During his tenure he was fiercely in opposition to redistributionism and government aid, viewing it as immoral theft. After the Great American Collapse, he promised the people of Deseret a nonintrusive, minimalist government. The war-weary populace readily agreed and elected him. Now Benson's vison of maximum liberty will play out across the nation of Deseret, perhaps for a long time to come."
POLITICS_ROMNEY_DESC:0 "George W Romney, born 1907 in the Mormon Colonies in Mexico, is a successful Mormon businessman and an anti-syndicalist political pundit. Having witnessed Syndicalist revolutions in both Britain and Mexico, where Romney had been a missionary, Romney developed a great aversion to Syndicalist ideology. During the 2nd American Civil War, Romney served as Acting Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the federal government, and had traveled the Federal controlled territories speaking about the dangers of Syndicalism and stirring up support for the war. Now he has been appointed to the leadership of an independent Deseret, and his anti-syndicalist vision will safely guide them into the future."
POLITICS_HEBER_DESC:0 "Heber Grant, born 1865 in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the president of the Church of Latter Day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church. An apostle, Grant was called in 1918, after the death of Joseph F. Smith, to serve as the leader of the Mormon Church. As leader, he led an agenda of strict Prohibition, banned plural marriages, and reconciled relations with the US Government. During the 2nd American Civil War, he urged Mormons to support the Federal government, seeing it as the best hope for a orderly and moral society in America. After the Great American Collapse, the LDS Church, with Grant at its head, has taken the reigns and re-established the nation of Deseret as an independent Mormon nation. Once again the Mormons rely on their faith in God to lead them towards a better tomorrow."
POLITICS_REUBENCLARK_DESC:0 "J. Reuben Clark was born in Grantsville, Utah Territory, on September 1st 1871. First a employee of the State Department, and then returning to Utah to serve as Second Counselor to the First President. In October 1934, Clark was ordained an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. During the ACW he proposed several reforms which centralized and expanded the Church Of Latter Day Saints' business operations. After the Great American Collapse, Clark and Grant would lead opposing factions within the Church. After a long and tumultuous powerstruggle, Clark secured his power and led the Church in taking over the state of Deseret and restoring order. Now his hand will guide it to the future."

USA_righteous_nation:0 "The Rightful President"
USA_righteous_nation_desc:0 "In light of the recent electoral deadlock, former President Herbert Hoover has given Douglas MacArthur his permission to succeed him as president of the United States and Commander in Chief. This was a painful decision for Hoover, but one that he felt needed to be done to end the crisis. Consequently, the new administration has gained legitimacy in the eyes of many of our citizens, and MacArthur is seen as the rightful winner of the election. With the support of most of Hoover's cabinet and Hoover himself, we are one step closer to bringing order to this fractured nation!"

USA_Garner_free_trade:0 "Sweep away Farm Tariffs"
USA_Garner_free_trade_desc:0 "Farmers have long leaned Democratic, largely in opposition to the Republican policy of supporting protectionism which made it more difficult to export their own goods. While many of them have drifted to the AFP, Progressives, Old Democrats and even Socialists, undoing Hoover's Tariff policy will undercut the radicals while aiding farmers."
USA_rural_investments:0 "Rural Investments"
USA_rural_investments_desc:0 "While generally opposed to high-levels of government intervention in the economy, supporting the rural economy is a no-brainer. The government will purchase goods from struggling farmers and grant state funding that will be used to support developing rural regions via the introduction or modernization of electricity."
USA_austerity:0 "Austerity Through the Storm"
USA_austerity_desc:0 "We have made the necessary investments to damage support for the radicals amongst the backbone of our democracy: the farmers and sharecroppers. However, now we must cut back on the budget and show businesses that this is a fiscally responsible nation they can invest in if we are to avoid both a debt that radicals can use against us and aid the economic recovery throughout the nation. But what to slash..."
USA_smash_radicals:0 "Smash Radicals"
USA_smash_radicals_desc:0 "We will not give into those who threaten to subvert American democracy for their own interests! MacArthur has offered to stomp them out if given the chance, and we will allow him to organize his military and gather intel for the mission. The only question is whom to focus on and how much so."
USA_undermine_old_democrats:0 "Undermine the Populists"
USA_undermine_old_democrats_desc:0 "We will not allow Populist factions to continue to undermine the Democratic Party! We will campaign throughout the regions where they are most popular, spread counter-propaganda, and promise tax cuts whenever possible. Of course we should decide which faction deserves our attention most, if not all of them."
USA_hoovers_boys:0 "The Director's Boys"
USA_hoovers_boys_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover is both the ruthless head of the recently formed Federal Bureau of Investigation and an invaluable asset against the militias and fanatics endangering liberty in the United States. He has offered numerous times to further investigate dangerous extremists if given the resources and direction."
USA_reassert_democrats:0 "Reassert the Democratic Party"
USA_reassert_democrats_desc:0 "The Democratic Party had suffered much from the rise of the numerous third parties attempting to steal its voterbase. However, the US can only be stable under a two-party system. We will use our re-established presence to bring old supporters back into the traditional Democratic mold, hopefully finishing off the AFP and Old Democrats from national importance."
USA_army_expansion:0 "MacArthur's Request"
USA_army_expansion_desc:0 "MacArthur seems to be effectively waging war against the radicals but has been desperately calling for additional aid, seemingly taking the governments lack of willingness to expand the military as a sign of weakness.

USA_yay_liquor_desc:0 "There have been increasingly loud calls for prohibition in recent years, and in fact, many states and smaller districts have enacted dry laws to damage the liquor business. However, the state needs funding and the right to alcohol is a fundamental freedom.

America has been saved from the radicals and it is now time for Garner to set a precedent of divorcing the executive and legislative branches from one another.

USA_home_rule_negotiations:0 "Home Rule Negotiations"
USA_home_rule_negotiations_desc:0 "America will not be saved with the iron fist but instead with that which has always served America best; freedom. If the people that make up the various radical sectors of America want to run their local governments differently so be it, but that does not mean they can leave America or violate the Constitution. Allow us to start the talks for a reasonable amount of autonomy."
USA_calm_the_storm:0 "Calm the Storm"
USA_calm_the_storm_desc:0 "We must reassure the nation that violent outbursts are not to be tolerated. We must direct the party to speak of the peace achieved and that only those practice their views through violence will be targeted by the federal government. In the meantime we can calm all sides by telling the military to move garrisons from border regions of radical territory as we were previously prepared for potential conflict."
USA_counter_klan:0 "Counter the Klan"
USA_counter_klan_desc:0 "The question of how to deal with the Klan is a complicated one. Much of Congress is in cahoots with the National Democratic White League, and they command enough power to cause major damage to the US if they desired. However, if we are to deal with it bloodlessly, we should embrace the more moderate members of the organization and encourage them to leave the Klan and NDWL in favor of smaller, more controllable groups. We won't get the hardliners to leave, but if we can sap most of their support, the effort will be a success."
USA_moderate_the_unions:0 "Reward Moderate Unions"
USA_moderate_the_unions_desc:0 "Destroying the Unions is an incredibly touchy subject, and one that rarely results in anyone winning. However, there is still a chance we can Bust the Unions and still come out on top, the SPA doesn't have a complete monopoly yet on Labor, there are still some, although small, Unions have have our sympathies, if we reward these Unions, and have them actively go against the radical ones, we just might be able to save America from the Syndicalist Terror, though that possibility looks more and more slim by the hour..."
USA_reassure_business:0 "Reassure Business"
USA_reassure_business_desc:0 "With the country seemingly ready to collapse at any day now, Big Business is more terrified then ever. We cannot let our great American businesses fail us, we must reassure them that we're going to fix this crisis and bring back America to the economic level she naturally should be at. Because after all, if confidence collapses, then the depression we're in will go on far longer, and the Radicals will grow even stronger."
USA_hunt_waste:0 "Hunt Waste"
USA_hunt_waste_desc:0 "In order to keep some semblace of Confidence in the Economy, we have to begin to institute austerity. It won't be all popular, but hopefully the new confidence will get Big Business investing again, and this crisis can finally end."
USA_return_to_normalcy:0 "A Return to Normalcy"
USA_return_to_normalcy_desc:0 "Against all odds, our plan has worked. Investment is steadily increasing, Strikes are becoming more and more rare, and the KKK have been pushed back into the South. The odds were against us, but we did it. We have returned to normalcy."
USA_curtis_in_charge:0 "The Old Guard"
USA_curtis_in_charge_desc:0 "While we are not Socialists, we agree that it's foolhardy to think that this crisis is going to suddenly evaporate just because we increased confidence. We knew that in 1789 we knew it in 1860, we knew it in 1896, and we know it now. Now, the government must do what it can to reward hard working Americans, just like we did in the past, whether that'd be unemployment or through tariffs."
USA_work_sharing_plan:0 "Work Sharing Plan"
USA_work_sharing_plan_desc:0 "One of the most ingenious ideas our economists have thought up, the Work Sharing Plan, might just be enough to save our nation. We compensate Americans for their hours lost via partial unemployment subsidies, and buisnesses to retrain them for when the crisis is over and they can get back to work! Thanks to to this ingenious idea, we can keep the amount spent to a minimum, and keep our populace happy!"
USA_new_tariffs:0 "New Tariffs"
USA_new_tariffs_desc:0 "The Republican Party has always been a protectionist party. Tariffs increase revenue for the Federal Government, protect our workers and employers from cheap foreign goods, and can be used as leverage in foreign policy. With the economy needing some new revenue for our Work Sharing Plan, tariffs serve as a natural policy, just as it did in our past economic crisises."
USA_good_times:0 "Good Times Are Just Around the Corner"
USA_good_times_desc:0 "Thanks to our careful balancing between intervention and free market, our economy is finally looking to be out of this crisis! It was hard, but thanks to our tried and true ways, America is finally back on her feet and set to make a full recovery! Good times will be coming round soon!"
USA_peace_through_trade:0 "Peace through Trade"
USA_peace_through_trade_desc:0 "While we have been protectionist in the past, it's time to let old policies go. Tariffs only serve to estrange our trade partners and further increase costs for the average American, as well as increase the already bloated power of the all encompassing Federal Government. Thus, by increasing cooperation with our allies, we can finally end the idiotic policy of Tariffs."
USA_landon_plan:0 "The Landon Plan"
USA_landon_plan_desc:0 "While we must stand firmly by capitalism, it is clear the economy is not going to recover on its own in short order without some government intervention. We should issue some investments and remove trade barriers to increase consumption and increase market confidence."
USA_i_will_not_promise:0 "I Will Not Promise the Moon"
USA_i_will_not_promise_desc:0 "We have gone far in recent days, freeing the economy from the shackles of the depression and providing goods for the people. But we must reassure the public, and investors, that we will not go too far, and balance the budget by cutting back when possible in our projects after negotiating with private sector leaders to take over. The economy shall grow and the US government will be seen as solvent and honest."
USA_unite_federal_americans:0 "Unite Federal Americans"
USA_unite_federal_americans_desc:0 "We have done it! We can now focus on chipping away at the support bases of the radicals more openly without political and economic stability fueling them. A propaganda and educational campaign will raise awareness of the federal government's recent actions, our national political identity and the threats posed by those who desire revolution."
USA_norris:0 "The Fighting Liberal"
USA_norris_desc:0 "Despite the odds, President Norris has been elected, and now serves as the 31st President of the USA. One of the few Progressives left in America, Norris has won on a platform of the Square Deal, saving the American Public from war, and finally living up to the goals of American Democracy. This is true for all Americans, no matter their creed. There is much to do, and the odds are slim, but Norris will save America."
USA_progressive_collaboration:0 "Progressive Collaboration"
USA_progressive_collaboration_desc:0 "The Progressives have long been outspoken allies of our cause, from Roosevelt to Mr. Floyd, the Progressives have always been great supporters of Democracy and the American Dream, and are the fiercest opponents of the Ku Klux Klan by far. It is only natural that we do our best to ally ourselves with them."
USA_emergency_intervention:0 "Emergency Intervention"
USA_emergency_intervention_desc:0 "This is not the time for doing what we can to help out the well off. Investment will always be a slow process, too slow. That's why we need to intervene now and make sure that every American is fed, clothed, and sheltered. Because if there's one thing that's worse than the economic crisis, it's the possibility of Radicals militantly putting the population into war."
USA_mcnary_plan:0 "McNary Plan"
USA_mcnary_plan_desc:0 "Republican Senator Charles McNary has a plan to help our farmers. We will implement higher domestic prices for farm products in order to help our farmers get back on their feet. The government will purchase some of these in order to assist them further. This will let farmers get back to work and some of their family members will be available for other projects."
USA_muscle_shoal_plan:0 "Muscle Shoal Plan"
USA_muscle_shoal_plan_desc:0 "The Tennessee River has previously served very little purpose for the United States. With President Norris's goal of Electrification taking great precedent over these past few months, a few of our engineers think that Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee would make it an idylic place for a Hydroelectric Dam! This would obviously serve as a great boon, not only for the engineering benefits, but also for electrification!"
USA_war_on_unemployment:0 "Mass Unemployment Relief"
USA_war_on_unemployment_desc:0 "Our people need to be able to live. To not support the hardest working people in our nation is suicide. Thus, President Norris will institute the biggest unemployment fund ever seen on the Western Hemisphere, so that we may get out of this crisis and into a brighter future!"
USA_war_on_the_klan:0 "Strike the White Leagues"
USA_war_on_the_klan_desc:0 "There is one group that has such notoriety that its mere mention can turn a room silent: The Ku Klux Klan. The KKK is by far the most dangerous terrorist group facing our shores in this massive crisis; their weekly political assassinations and voter suppression and intimidation efforts are unmatched. That is why we must attack them at their source. The President will declare that the various white leagues across the nation will be disbanded at once."
USA_southern_investments:0 "Southern Investments"
USA_southern_investments_desc:0 "Now that we've struck the worst of the bunch, it's time to move on to the average man. Before the KKK inevitably reforms, we have to convince the South that we are not the enemy; by increasing their quality of life, we might just be able to do that. Taking into account the socioeconomic reality that the South is the poorest region of the USA, perhaps by giving them special investment priority, they'll see that we're not the enemy."
USA_radical_republican_constiuency:0 "Revive a Radical Republican Constituency"
USA_radical_republican_constiuency_desc:0 "The Radical Republicans, America's forgotten Progressives. Ever since that fateful November in 1876, the once mightiest party faction in the RNC and even the nation has been nothing but a memory. That is, until we came along. It is time to revive this relic for the modern day, to remind all Americans that we're not radicals like the SPA or the AFP, but merely a rebirth of what was once the most powerful faction in America."
USA_jeffersonian_agrarianism:0 "Jeffersonian Agrarianism"
USA_jeffersonian_agrarianism_desc:0 "The South still sees us as Carpetbaggers seeking to replace their Agrarian way of life with some vauge notion of an Urbanist hell hole; they couldn't be further from the truth. We don't seek to uproot Agrarianism, just the opposite: we are the descendants of Jefferson when it comes to agriculture, and with our policies the South will turn into a paradise!"
USA_square_deal:0 "The Square Deal"
USA_square_deal_desc:0 "About 30 year ago, Teddy Roosevelt was President, and he had a dream. A dream of a square, fair deal. A dream that all Americans would be taken care of, not because of some Paternalistic idea of State Loyalty, but because it was simply the right thing to do. His successors failed at this, and it's up to us to finish it."
USA_infrastrucure_for_the_future:0 "Infrastructure for the Future"
USA_infrastrucure_for_the_future_desc:0 "We're not thinking far ahead enough. In 30 some odd years, our new roads are going to be worthless! We need to plan ahead for the future, so that even if all else fails, Americans will still be able to rely on good, solid, infrastructure."
USA_dreams_of_henry_george:0 "Dreams of Henry George"
USA_dreams_of_henry_george_desc:0 "Henry George was a notable figure in the Progressive Era. His advocacy of a single tax on land, in which property taxes would be the only taxes people would pay, is very popular with our party, and our constituents. Let us embrace this idea, brought to us by Henry George, Thomas Paine, and John Locke. Towards a more prosperous future!"
USA_forresty_for_america:0 "Forestry for America"
USA_forresty_for_america_desc:0 "America was once not known for her massive Industry, but for her trees. Most people can remember the massive lumber mills that once populated every small town in the Northern United States. However, what is seldom talked about is the environmental aspect of the massive Lumber Industry. The once massive woodlands are slowly turning into depopulated swamps with the loss of the trees, and we cannot allow this to happen further"
USA_a_popular_vote:0 "A Popular Vote"
USA_a_popular_vote_desc:0 "The Electoral College, quite frankly, is anti democratic. There have been three elections where our supposed representatives have voted against the will of the people. In order to preserve democracy, we must get rid of this old system, and replace it with a modern, democratic, popular election."
USA_the_greatest_evil:0 "The Greatest Evil"
USA_the_greatest_evil_desc:0 "Alcohol is a disease that poisons the mind, body, and soul. It turns men into vicious, vindictive demons. This must end. It is time to end this plague upon our nation, and liberate ourselves to finally be free. It is time to break the bottle."
USA_fight_the_debt:0 "Fighting Our Debt"
USA_fight_the_debt_desc:0 "We have engaged in significant deficit spending to get out of this economic crisis. While this hasn't necessarily harmed us yet, many of our politicians are urging us to make sure our debt does not become unmanageable. We should take measures to cut our debt, perhaps raising taxes on the wealthy would do the trick. They can handle it..."
USA_model_legislature:0 "A Model Legislature"
USA_model_legislature_desc:0 "We have restored American government to its past glory. Now, our legislature will be a shining example for the world to see, and our twinkling social democracy should inspire democratic governments the world over. It truly will be our century."

### Navy With A State ###
USA_navy_in_command:0 "The Navy in Command"
USA_navy_in_command_desc:0 "After months of tension between the Navy and MacArthur, largely stemming from MacArthur's attempts to impose his will on the Navy and a perception that MacArthur's actions are endangering the war effort, the U.S. Navy has taken control of the government. Though they have apparently done so with the support of Congress and the Western Command Center, the alliance is a fragile one, and what will happen next is unknown..."
USA_admiral_leahy:0 "Admiral Leahy"
USA_admiral_leahy_desc:0 "William D. Leahy, nicknamed "the Judge" by his peers, has seized the reins of the country from Douglas MacArthur and now hopes to turn the nation on a path towards democracy once more. Blaming MacArthur for beginning the war, he also hopes to negotiate with the Western factions to help mend the damage done to the country and hopefully save America."
USA_pacific_reconciliation:0 "Pacific Reconciliation"
USA_pacific_reconciliation_desc:0 "The loss of the Pacific Coast and all its resources was devastating for the war effort. If we are to mend the damage that MacArthur has done, we must reach out to the Pacific government and come to an agreement regarding the end of the war."
USA_naval_investments:0 "Naval Investments"
USA_naval_investments_desc:0 "It is the belief of Admiral Leahy that significant naval investment is necessary for a successful war effort. As seen in the First Civil War, the U.S. Navy can have a devastating impact on the ability of the enemy to continue fighting, and though MacArthur neglected this fact, we will not."
USA_court_the_rockies:0 "Court the Rockies"
USA_court_the_rockies_desc:0 "Though Douglas MacArthur was untrustworthy, his counterparts in the West are dedicated to American democracy. They have expressed a willingness to cooperate in any way necessary to restore the liberties we once cherished as citizens of this ravaged country. To further reassure these men, we must meet with Eisenhower and Bradley and prove to them that we will serve the United States, not our own interests."
USA_supreme_court_trial:0 "Supreme Court Trial"
USA_supreme_court_trial_desc:0 "With MacArthur and the men who hepled him coup the government in our hands, their fate must now be decided. However, given the nature of his involvement in politics, Congress has insisted that he be given to the Supreme Court rather than a court martial to decide his fate. Their decision looms large over our administration and the country at large..."
USA_decision_of_congress:0 "Decision of Congress"
USA_decision_of_congress_desc:0 "Though Leahy has taken the reins of government from MacArthur, he is reluctant to remain in this position. Instead, we have left the decision of how we proceed with restoring democracy to Congress. We can only hope that they make the right decision for the country."
USA_savior_of_democracy:0 "The Savior of Democracy"
USA_savior_of_democracy_desc:0 "Though there is much work to be done, the situation within our own borders has stabilized. The U.S. Navy has saved democracy, and though we cannot end the Civil War so easily, we now have a righteous cause that will unify all true Americans to us!"
USA_admiral_king:0 "Admiral King"
USA_admiral_king_desc:0 "Admiral Ernest King tolerated MacArthur's insulting treatment of the U.S. Navy for months, but when MacArthur threatened to take direct control over the Navy, it became too much to handle. King did what he had to do-not just for the Navy, but for the country. Now that he is in charge though, we must focus on winning the war."
USA_the_blank_check:0 "The Blank Check"
USA_the_blank_check_desc:0 "Douglas MacArthur neglected industry during his brief time in power, whether it was concerned with the navy or otherwise. This state of affairs cannot continue. We must put the limited resources we possess to work producing vehicles, ships, and equipment for our military. To do so, King has announced a "Blank Check" for the econonmy; that is, an investment of however much money is necessary to win the war, regardless of its later reprecussions."
USA_protection_for_payment:0 "Protection for Payment"
USA_protection_for_payment_desc:0 "We cannot fund our growing navy without the resources to do so. To help us in this effort, Admiral King plans to offer U.S. Navy protection in exchange for various resources or other forms of financial compensation. Of course, if these regions fail to pay their due, we will act accordingly to ensure they have all the protection they will ever need, and of course, that we have everything we need too."
USA_congressional_subordination:0 "Congressional Subordination"
USA_congressional_subordination_desc:0 "Though Congress supported our efforts to oust MacArthur, they are now nothing more than a nuisance. We must bring them to heel if we want to avoid the same fate as MacArthur, a fate that King does not intend to share. The only question that remains is how to proceed with this act..."
USA_secure_the_coastline:0 "Secure the Coastline"
USA_secure_the_coastline_desc:0 "Significant parts of our population, industry, and resources lie on or near the coast. Securing our own coastline is essential to guarding our territory, and securing the coastlines of our rivals will bring us one step closer to victory. The ability to blockade and starve the enemy cannot be underestimated, and as such, we will gain control over these areas at once."
USA_navy_first:0 "Navy First"
USA_navy_first_desc:0 "Though it has been neglected in recent years, Admiral King believes that it is never too late to shift resources towards the Navy. Through this investment, we will force our enemies in the Civil War into submission, and when that is done, perhaps we will have the strength to defend ourselves against other global powers as well. It is time the Navy had its due!"
USA_admiral_of_navy:0 "The Fleet Admiral"
USA_admiral_of_navy_desc:0 "It is time that Ernest King took on a title worthy of his position at the head of the American war effort. As some of his men have already referred to him as "Fleet Admiral", he has decided to adopt this as his title. Now the world will see what such a man can do when in total control over his nation..."
USA_american_dockyards:0 "American Dockyards"
USA_american_dockyards_desc:0 "It is time that America surpassed the likes of Germany, Britain, Japan, and Canada, in her naval capacities. We have the potential to build the largest navy the world has ever seen, and yet we have not. By building up our naval industry, we will be one step closer to achieving this aim."
USA_the_canal_we_built:0 "The Canal We Built"
USA_the_canal_we_built_desc:0 "The key to naval dominance in the Americas lies not only in the amount of ships we have, but also in our control over the Panama Control. However, our influence in this region has been threatened as of late, and given that we built the canal, it is only fair that we maintain our control over it. Let us move to secure it before another country can stop us."
USA_ports_of_the_atlantic:0 "Ports of the Atlantic"
USA_ports_of_the_atlantic_desc:0 "That we are surrounded on all sides by Englishmen and their lackeys is a fact that has been duly noted in King's administration, and it is a state of affairs we cannot allow. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans protect us, but they will only do so if they are firmly under our control. We must move at once to guarantee that it is America, not the Entente, that controls the Atlantic."
USA_the_beautiful_pacific:0 "The Beautiful Pacific"
USA_the_beautiful_pacific_desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean is a vast region, but it is one that we have dominated-at least until recently. Now, Japan, Germany, and the Entente alike threaten our interests there. King insists that our control over the Pacific territories is vital to any attempt to become a superpower in our own right. With our newfound naval strength, it should pose no risk to us..."
USA_end_the_anglo_empire:0 "End the Anglo Empire"
USA_end_the_anglo_empire_desc:0 "For too long, the British Navy has loomed large over the world, lording over its imperial possessions and now directly interfering in our affairs. Though King is no fan of syndicalists, the Canadian move to seize New England was a blatant denial of American sovereignty. Now we will teach these overmighty Brits a lesson."

USA_mac_victory:0 "Victory in the Civil War"
USA_mac_victory_desc:0 "Separatists have again failed in their mission to destroy the union of the United States of America. Though both radical socialists and populists dug into our power base, we have proven the power of legitimate government once more. The would-be dictators Haywood and Long are no longer welcome in America, nor are the Southern traitors that fought under Murray. "

USA_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "Separatists have again failed in their mission to destroy the union of the United States of America.

The would-be dictators Haywood and Long are no longer welcome in America."
USA_SPQA:0 "Senatus Populusque Americanus"
USA_SPQA_desc:0 "MacArthur, the quintessential tyrannical executive, has been pressured into stepping down in what is a victory for the legislative branch and for republicanism as a whole. We shall return to an older time in America, when Congress ruled the land, and presidents were too weak to impose their will upon the American people, as the British kings once did. Candidates for the major parties will be chosen from Congress to seek the presidency, and we shall enter a new era in our republic."  
USA_congressional_authority:0 "Congressional Authority"
USA_congressional_authority_desc:0 "Though our country has three equal branches of government, the executive branch has gained more and more power since the days of Abraham Lincoln. Perhaps it is best that an executive have power during a war; the Romans certainly thought so. However, we cannot allow America to slip into dictatorship, as they did, and Congress shall exercise its authority against any would-be tyrant, in any way it can."
USA_new_amendments:0 "New Amendments"
USA_new_amendments_desc:0 "The cries of our people have not fallen on deaf ears. The Civil War would have never occurred were it not for political malfeasance throughout our government. It is time our constitution was updated, and as such, we shall pass new amendments addressing some of the concerns levied against big businesses as well as against the rebellious immigrants they hired."
USA_congress_restored:0 "Full Congressional Restoration"
USA_congress_restored_desc:0 "Congress has been fully restored to its old glory. Those who stepped down in recent times out of intimidation are returning, and new blood is coming to Washington as well. Gone are the extremist parties that tore the nation apart, and they are replaced by revitalized Democratic and Republican parties that work to represent all. Americans can safely write to their congressmen once more, and democracy is saved."
USA_classical_liberal_mandate:0 "The American Cincinnatus"
USA_classical_liberal_mandate_desc:0 "Though the temptation towards autocracy was great, America stood with its three branches intact, without giving up to executive authority. Congress is called into emergency session and the Appellate Courts are dealing with their mountain of paper trying to sort out the consequences. For his part, MacArthur is seen as a hero who did his duty to the country and stepped down when he was no longer needed."
USA_democratic_education:0 "Constitutional Education"
USA_democratic_education_desc:0 "A common talking point by radicals and populists was the idea that the Federal Government is a voluntary organization. Some even claim to use ridiculous false loopholes like naval law or the rights to secede from the union. We must correct this by making the U.S Constitution as widely available as possible."
USA_review_the_fed:0 "Review the Fed"
USA_review_the_fed_desc:0 "One of the things we must do to recover from the recent turmoil is to review the Federal Reserve. Some argue that we should privatize it, saying that it would be more efficient this way. Others want to fully abolish it, saying it is an institution that is not necessary to solve financial crises. There are also those who wish to reform it and make it a better institution. Regardless, we must make a decision regarding it." 
USA_bill_of_rights:0 "Bill of Rights Reminder"
USA_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "Building off of a Constitutional education initiative, Congress has approved of an education push to younger Americans on the importance of our Bill of Rights. This will also allow citizens to better appeal for their rights in a non-violent manner."
USA_american_values1:0 "American Values"
USA_american_values1_desc:0 "The passive promotion of civil government through high minded publications was undercut sharply by pamphlets and private publishers that promoted an uncivil government.

USA_malice_and_charity:0 "Malice and Charity"
USA_malice_and_charity_desc:0 "With the words of president Lincoln reminding us to 'bind the nation's wounds', Congress has created a system to reintegrate the rebel states on a massive scale. Through a non-partisan Committee called 'Malice and Charity', districts can be re-added to the Union."

USA_finish_spa:0 "Destroy Radicalism"
USA_finish_spa_desc:0 "While the US Government tolerates political discourse, Congress has rallied against the syndicalist and distributionist platforms of Long and Haywood.

USA_fight_the_poll_tax_desc:0 "After the First Civil War, we established a Freedmen's Bureau to help African Americans join the larger society. With the Second Civil War over, we must do this again, but go farther. We will promote Black politicians and allow Black people the right to vote, and make sure they have what they need to keep the Klan down."
USA_redeemer_collaboration:0 "Redeemer Collaboration"
USA_redeemer_collaboration_desc:0 "There are some members of the ODP and the Klan that our politicians insist we try to rehabilitate, likely due to the fact many of them were Democrats once. We will seek out the least radical and rabid among them and bring them back into the fold. In exchange, they will help us hunt down remaining Klan members. This may be unpopular with our Black citizens, yet it is necessary to restore order."

These representatives are pushing us to maintain our own federal controls of industry, so that we can clamp down on corporate greed."
USA_local_control:0 "Local Industrialism"
USA_local_control_desc:0 "Many of our Social Democrats who are sympathetic to Syndicalist views have argued that we should implement a system of "Local Industrialism".

USA_defend_democracy_desc:0 "Out of the former rebel states, reports have come in of voter intimidation based on class and race.

USA_end_jim_crow:0 "End Jim Crow"
USA_end_jim_crow_desc:0 "Abraham Lincoln is rolling in his grave today, partly thanks to the Jim Crow system in the South. The system is slavery in all but name, and if we are to restore liberal democracy, we must end this system. This may be unpopular with more racist Southerners, but we will not make the mistake of coddling them again."
USA_traditional_machines:0 "Traditional Machines"
USA_traditional_machines_desc:0 "The Democratic Party has dominated the South for decades. In most of the region, the Republican Party doesn't even have any infrastructure. Why tear down already established political machines if they can become more moderate? We will work with these machines to make sure we can fully control the South."
USA_trial_of_the_federalists:0 "Trial of the Federalists"
USA_trial_of_the_federalists_desc:0 "MacArthur betrayed the constitution when he forced his way into power in Washington. We must decide the fate of his followers. Some of our politicians and military officials argue that these men saved this country, and their opponents insist with equal energy that we hang every one of them. Their fate will be decided in the courts, as was the fate of criminals before the Second Civil War."
USA_loyal_army:0 "Loyalist Army"
USA_loyal_army_desc:0 "Though men like MacArthur overstepped their boundaries, punishing them too harshly would be seen as distasteful by many of our people.

USA_hit_radical_redshirts:0 "Crush the Old Klan"
USA_hit_radical_redshirts_desc:0 "The Old Ku Klux Klan is a leftover from the First Civil War. Almost eighty years later, it is finally time for them to die. We will squash the Black Legion and the Klan and make sure neither has the power to rise up against us ever again."
USA_salute_the_patriots:0 "Salute the Patriots"
USA_salute_the_patriots_desc:0 "MacArthur and his men have preserved the constitution, and have shown great restraint in doing so.

USA_strengthen_democracy:0 "Strengthen Democracy"
USA_strengthen_democracy_desc:0 "During the civil war, democratic processes were halted at the local level. Many elections in the border areas were skipped in order to focus more time on the existential crisis of the war for America. Democracy shall now rise from the ashes, and Congress has appointed a committee to ensure elections take place at the local level once more."
USA_civil_liberties:0 "Loyalty to America"
USA_civil_liberties_desc:0 "The early 1930s was the era of loyalty to men over ideals. Haywood, Long, and even Macarthur accrued a sort of clique of allies that saw their leaders as above the law. Several Congressmen have come out to apologize for their statements made during the war."
USA_ensure_political_stability:0 "Ensure Political Stability"
USA_ensure_political_stability_desc:0 "Although it is opposed by some of the legislatures, use of the FCC to monitor the airwaves against rebel radio stations is necessary. This measure along with several other forms of censorship are still necessary to end rebel pockets within the Contiguous U.S."

USA_protect_democracy_desc:0 "The 17th Amendment enhanced the democratic representation in America, but failed, in the long run, to make the electoral process more democratic.

USA_land_of_the_free_desc:0 "The use of penal labour in the prisoner of war camps is no longer tolerable to Congress. Although the fate of these prisoners is still up to the court's system, their exploitation in both loyal and rebel states should be rolled back."
USA_home_of_the_brave:0 "Home of the Brave"
USA_home_of_the_brave_desc:0 "The veterans of the Second Civil War have sacrificed it all to preserve their home, if only they didn't have to fight other Americans.

USA_for_the_people:0 "For the People"
USA_for_the_people_desc:0 "The people of America as a collective are our constituents and our lifeblood.

USA_future_of_the_afp:0 "Future of the AFP"
USA_future_of_the_afp_desc:0 "Congress has decided that the AFP is a traitorous party and must be treated as such. It will be banned under the 1917 Sedition Acts.

USA_court_populists:0 "Court Populist Voters"
USA_court_populists_desc:0 "Since the days of the Farmers Alliance, populism on the left and right has presented the greatest threat to our two party system. While the AFP must be punished, we cannot ignore the appeal of many of their ideas, specifically the ideas of greenback currency and first-past-the-post voting. These ideas will be put before Congress and voted on, to show former AFP supporters that we hear them."
USA_political_traditionalism:0 "Political Traditionalism"
USA_political_traditionalism_desc:0 "The Democratic and Republican parties have served this country for decades. The recent rise of extremist parties has shown us that we cannot tolerate third parties rising up to challenge our system.

### Post Civil War - Macarthur ###
USA_american_caeser:0 "The American Caesar"
USA_american_caeser_desc:0 "President MacArthur has proclaimed he would not concede victory to the very partisans who caused the civil war. His American Junta promises a national restoration and adoption of functional democracy as MacArthur sees it. Elimination of unnecessary politicians and appointment of more competent officials will bridge the gap between people and politics."
USA_army_education:0 "Army Education"
USA_army_education_desc:0 "Parent Organizations have come out to claim we willingly let children into the military underage. Our solution is to divert prospective youth into military education while keeping them in public school. The ideas of physical education and morals taught by Bellamy will revive that old Nationalist fervour that failed us in the 1910s."
USA_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "National Youth of America"
USA_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "The pull to mandate a higher working age is countered by the multitudes of unemployed youth strewn across America. The solution is to establish a National Youth Administration in order to provide work and education to Americans too young to vote."
USA_the_american_legion:0 "Reforming the Legion"
USA_the_american_legion_desc:0 "With the American Legion National Commander Smedley Butler now a fugitive, it is necessary to rebuild the organization to remove the stain of partisan politics. No longer will National Commanders be permitted to campaign for politicians, nor will they be permitted to stay once they are career politicians."
USA_americanism:0 "Loyal to the Flag"
USA_americanism_desc:0 "Unlike the tyrants and despots that are common in the Americas, MacArthur desires not to be a Great Man, but to be a respected and mortal leader of Americans. Loyalty to the unchanging ideal of America must be put above himself, so long as MacArthur's popularity holds out."
USA_martial_law_:0 "Martial Law"
USA_martial_law_desc:0 "With Congressional Approval, habeas corpus is suspended in accordance with the constitution. As the threat of invasion from syndicalist and populist forces still looms over part of the land, it is clear that we must act to ensure a secure transition to the post-Civil War era. The writ of habeas corpus and free speech is still suspended for political expediency, and we shall institute martial law to help find any remaining rebels."
USA_restore_democracy:0 "American Junta"
USA_restore_democracy_desc:0 "When the Roman Republic was in crisis, powerful generals rose up to save the country from itself. MacArthur's deal with Eisenhower and Bradley has been partly made public, though neither the American people nor the rest of the committee will know the nature of their relationship. We must now decide who else shall serve alongside these three men in the new Junta."
USA_defending_the_republic:0 "Fate of the Civilian Government"
USA_defending_the_republic_desc:0 "The events of the last few years have shown the military that politicians cannot be trusted to keep the peace. MacArthur is confident they can run the country better than the three branches ever did. Still, these men will retain their places in our government, a relic of older times if nothing else, while the Junta holds true power. The ruling "Committee" shall make important decisions in the country now."
USA_american_legion:0 "Utilize the Legion"
USA_american_legion_desc:0 "Smedley Butler's American Legion is now under our control, and it shall have an important place in our new regime. The Legion will keep the peace and hopefully snuff out any rebellions in their infancy, while also helping our law enforcement forces to make sure laws are followed. We will never have lawlessness in our nation again!"
USA_the_committee:0 "The Committee"
USA_the_committee_desc:0 "Our new ruling committee is made up of various military officials who will collectively govern the country in the name of the American people. This is the only way we can ensure that the country survives, and the military will now have the resources it so crucially lacked before the Civil War. Though MacArthur had to give up complete power, he is still the face of the regime, and holds significant power compared to his counterparts."
USA_navy_support:0 "Navy Support"
USA_navy_support_desc:0 "One faction of the military that we have yet to court is the Navy. The U.S. Navy, like the rest of the military, was torn apart by the Civil War, yet they also played a crucial part in our victory. Their popularity means our government will not be seen as fully legitimate until we bring them in the fold and offer them a place in the new ruling committee. For now, they cannot match the power of the Army, but we should watch them to make sure that this remains the case."
USA_air_power:0 "Air Power"
USA_air_power_desc:0 "Another important factor in the war was the airplane. Our airmen bravely battled in the air, over the sea, and over battlefields during the entire duration of the conflict, and now, they deserve investment. Lessons learned in the war can help us make our air force the best in the world; new technologies have been developed and new doctrines envisioned by our air commanders."`
USA_court_generals:0 "Court Dissenting Generals"
USA_court_generals_desc:0 "Some generals did not agree with our decision to establish a military junta over the country, instead wishing for a restoration of democracy. Others are bitter that they were excluded from the Committee and demand a say in the new government. We should bring these dissenters into the fold by offering them bribes, honors, or positions outside the Committee, so that we do not have to sleep with one eye open."
USA_backroom_deals:0 "Backroom Deals"
USA_backroom_deals_desc:0 "The relationship between MacArthur, Eisenhower, and Bradley has remained a closely kept secret, and for good reason. If other members of the Committee were made aware of the triumvirate that was developing between the three, perhaps they would be able to stop it. Soon though, the combined influence of the three men will be so great that they rule the country openly, as they already do in all but name."
USA_congress_courted:0 "The Question of Statehood"
USA_congress_courted_desc:0 "Unlike the First Civil War, we must deal with the majority of the country that decided to rebel. With the national government established, we should decide what to do with rebellious states. We could follow the lesson of that war and split the regions into various military districts until reconstruction is complete, or we could keep the states as they are. However, many states split during the war, and this could be difficult. Either way, we must decide carefully, for the sake of our regime."
USA_civilianization:0 "Civilianization"
USA_civilianization_desc:0 "To better adapt our people to the new regime, the members of the committee must decide how to govern. Should we don civilian clothing and resemble politicians, or shall we keep our military garb to intimidate would-be foes? There are various other ways we can come off as more friendly to our people as well, and we should decide how we want to appraoch the delicate matter of a military government."
USA_patriot_party:0 "A Patriot Party?"
USA_patriot_party_desc:0 "With the regime now more stable, perhaps we should adopt an institution that characterized American democracy for centuries, even if it has made Washington roll in his grave. Creating a new "Patriot Party" to represent the regime could help us gain legitimacy. However, others argue that we should distance ourselves from parties, as they are what brought the country to ruin to begin with. What shall we do?"
USA_congress_freed:0 "Congress Released"
USA_congress_freed_desc:0 "It is no longer neccessary for Congress to be protected by and to answer to the American military. Special elections in our core states have decided who will guide Congress during Reconstruction, and the people may once again expect to vote for their national leaders on a regular basis. Congress is free of the shackles imposed on it during the war, finally ready to help restore the country."
USA_fbi_cointelpro:0 "Second American Protective League"
USA_fbi_cointelpro_desc:0 "As the largest part of the Continuous United States has been pacified, it is essential that American citizens remain vigilant. The reformation of the League as a free information system to report potential populist or syndicalist spies to the Federal Government and to discourage public protest is absolutely needed."
USA_control_congress:0 "Control Congress"
USA_control_congress_desc:0 "Many former Democrats and Republicans have folded into MacArthur's new regime, while holdouts have fled. Fortunately, we were able to fill their vacancies with qualified, trustworthy individuals. These new Congressmen are not politicians per se, they are instead public servants for the American people."
USA_office_of_war_information:0 "Signals Intelligence Service"
USA_office_of_war_information_desc:0 "Cryptographic machines designed to interact with its sender to create an encryption that cannot be easily broken are the newest toy in our arsenal. The Signals Intelligence Service, which required the installation of underground cables to ensure secrecy, has finally been implemented."
USA_allien_sedition_acts:0 "Executive Order 7250-A"
USA_allien_sedition_acts_desc:0 "An Executive Order signed by President MacArthur hopes to bring an end the threat of foreign infiltration. This order restores some parts of the Alien and Sedition Act. State legislatures are already appealing cases to the Supreme Court. It is firmly believed, however, that MacArthur's new judges will side in his favor."
USA_empower_the_army:0 "Empower the Army"
USA_empower_the_army_desc:0 "A crisis has already risen in our new military administration. The Army and Navy are constantly at each other's throats over funding and political kickbacks. We need to relegate the Navy to a secondary governmental position and grant the Army full power."
USA_loyal_officers:0 "Old Soldiers Never Die"
USA_loyal_officers_desc:0 "The new regime recognizes the long struggle of the officers that left their homes to protect their nation, and to the many that didn't return home. Thanks to an Executive Order, Officers may now pursue a technical education in universities or go into law. This will ensure loyalty long after we fade away."
USA_loyalty_to_macarthur:0 "The Commander-in-Chief"
USA_loyalty_to_macarthur_desc:0 "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington. Washington set the precedent of retiring from active duty upon taking office, which MacArthur promises he will do once the national emergency is ended. Like Washington, MacArthur will remain ready to respond to threats to the nation."
USA_national_rehabilition:0 "National Rehabilitation"
USA_national_rehabilition_desc:0 "The creeds of Long and Haywood were wrong: it was not the industrialists and businessmen that caused civil strife, but the greedy career politician that gave them posts and took their money. We shall rehabilitate the capitalists to their proper position in American society."
USA_root_out_traitors:0 "Down With the Traitors"
USA_root_out_traitors_desc:0 "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America. They are the disloyal Prohibitionists, Grangers, Holy Rollers and foreigners that enabled the AFP and SPA to grow. These organizations have been rightfully banned for their implicit betrayal."
USA_loyalty_to_america:0 "Up With the Stars"
USA_loyalty_to_america_desc:0 "Nationalism has the goal of strengthening loyalty to the idea of America more than any American as a person. President MacArthur has chosen to refocus attention from himself to the nation as an object of admiration. No longer will a politicians ego exceed their stature, as the nation is mightier than they."
USA_american_stratocracy:0 "American Stratocracy"
USA_american_stratocracy_desc:0 "MacArthur has finally restored nationalist fervour and functional Democracy as he sees it. While some complain that career politicians have been replaced by officers, few will argue that the bureaucracy hasn't improved. The American people can now trust their politicians to use legal means to achieve their goals."
USA_defend_the_republic:0 "Defenders of the Republic"
USA_defend_the_republic_desc:0 "The militaries job is to defend American democracy at all costs, but only directly intervening to prevent the collapse of the Republic and only for as long as neccessary. This is the message we must spread throughout the ranks and in our public propaganda, both so that the American people accept MacArthur's time as leader and so the military remembers what their legitimacy is based on."
USA_the_junta:0 "American Junta"
USA_the_junta_desc:0 "MacArthur understands that he cannot rule the nation alone, and that the old democratic system is similary insufficient. Instead, he believes a council of high-ranking military officials will be able to work together to stabilize the nation. This would appease the loyal officials in the W.C.C. and would also remove the problem of establishing a successor, for now..."
USA_civil_autonomy:0 "Civil Autonomy"
USA_civil_autonomy_desc:0 "While the American junta wants as much control as possible, they understand that they cannot be everywhere at once. We will retain some of the old American practices, such as giving states and businesses some autonomy with regards to economic policy. This will make things more efficient, and lead to the creation of greater infrastructure in many of our devastated states."
USA_military_purchases:0 "Military Purchases"
USA_military_purchases_desc:0 "Never again will the United States be weak or unprepared for war. We will encourage the creation of whole industries in certain states, so that different regions of our country can specialize in different areas. The national government will then purchase from these factories, boosting the local economies in those communities as well as helping our military."
USA_limited_elections:0 "Safer Elections"
USA_limited_elections_desc:0 "Recent years have shown us the dangers of unregulated democracy. Instead, our people will choose their representatives from a list of military officials. Doing so will ensure that they are under the tight control of the ruling junta, and that a more consistent ideology can be advocated. No longer will the changes made by one man be undone as soon as his successor comes to power. This will stabilize our system."  
USA_protect_capitalism:0 "Capital Security Acts"
USA_protect_capitalism_desc:0 "The recent Second Civil War was the greatest threat to American capitalism in history. The junta will make a concentrated effort to preserve pre-war capitalism with new "Capital Security Acts". These will ensure that corporate money is guarded and will not be stolen or destroyed by anarchists. The injection of confidence into the business community will boost our economy."
USA_the_triumverant:0 "American Triumvirate"
USA_the_triumverant_desc:0 "Two men have come to prominence alongside MacArthur in the American junta. Dwight Eisenhower, a loyal man and a hard worker with a certain charisma about him, has risen to the top. Omar Bradley, a humble but mature man, has also emerged as a leading figure within the junta. Together, these three men will rule America as they see fit. All opposition will be crushed."
USA_all_american_legion:0 "All-American Legion"
USA_all_american_legion_desc:0 "We will have an American Protection Legion, which will replace the old American Protective League. This legion will serve similar purposes but with a new emphasis on patriotic and nationalist propaganda. Such efforts will make our people more dedicated to our country, and more importantly, our government. We will have eyes everywhere..."
USA_mandatory_service:0 "Total Patriotism"
USA_mandatory_service_desc:0 "Building on the amendment he drafted, MacArthur has now decided to implement mandatory service for a wider age group, to cement his position at the top of America. Every man will serve his country, and no nation on Earth will outnumber us in a future war, as we were in the Civil War."
USA_little_troopers:0 "Little Troopers"
USA_little_troopers_desc:0 "The Boy Scouts are a nice organization, but we need to raise young men who are ready for war. To this end, we will create the "Little Troopers" program, which will train young kids for real military service when they have come of age. This will give us desperately needed manpower to replace our losses in the Civil War, and make our population more patriotic." 
USA_baracks_capitalism:0 "Barracks Capitalism"
USA_baracks_capitalism_desc:0 "As of late, the phrases "Military-Industrial Complex" and "Barracks Capitalism" have been used more frequently to describe the new form of capitalism that MacArthur has pushed. With a humming war machine, he and his advisors argue, we will never have a depression again. We will outproduce our foes and bring America's full industrial might to bear on them." 
USA_salute_the_chief:0 "Salute the Chief"
USA_salute_the_chief_desc:0 "Hail to the Chief! All Americans will salute the man who has saved our country from extremists and foreign rule. MacArthur has inspired the American people and with them behind him, he is more powerful than ever before. He looks to the foreign arena now, in search of new foes."
USA_constitutional_amending:0 "Improve the Constitution"

While we seemed to finally be turning the corner in 1936, the events of Black Monday saw the economic situation in America worsen even more. Hoover was criticized for almost every program he proposed in that time. His public works projects, designed to create jobs, have been characterized as wasteful government spending.

These actions came to hurt the mainstream Democrat Party in the same way the 1912 election destroyed their rivals. While this would not have been a problem normally, the expansion of the Old Democrat Party to areas outside of the Solid South has been a worrying development. Worse, we have seen Klan activity spread further outside of the Solid South in much larger numbers than we have ever seen before. The time has come to investigate both the ODP and the Ku Klux Klan."

However, with Hoover's first term, he calmed tensions with the SPA. When the SPA began to evolve into the CSA and participate as a major part of it, this coalition of trade unions across the Midwest began to use political violence for their own ends. Such violence increasingly occurred between members of the CSA and the Klan and Old Democratic Party. The Failure of the SPA in 1932 lead to election violence across the Midwest between members of the SPA and various other political parties from Old Democrat Party members all the way to members of the Progressive Party. With the SPA's second defeat, now in the 1936 election, we have seen massive riots across the Midwest and various Strikes occurring.

### Events - Pre Election ###

ustates.1.t:0 "The United States in 1936"
ustates.1.d:0 "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. Relieved it had managed to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, Woodrow Wilson was the first US president to run and win a third-term as the “Man Who Kept the Peace” alongside his new running mate, former Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer. This political victory was short-lived however as Wilson suffered a stroke shortly after his election, setting off a constitutional crises and struggle for power in the cabinet until Wilson died in late 1923. Until then Wilson, Palmer and the cabinet reacted to the French and British Revolutions and growth of American syndicalism with increasingly extreme crackdowns on union organizing and eventually a slew of organizations suspected to have connections to the radical left. As workers became increasingly radicalized and anarchist bombers made several attempts on Palmer’s life the political situation deteriorated alongside the economy due to a combination of strikes, political instability and a loss of trading partners. \n\nPalmer’s own controversial presidency ended with the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928 who attempted to calm the situation with a “Return to Normalcy”, re-legalizing non-violent syndicalist outlets. This ultimately did little to help as a cumulation of speculative investing sent the United States spiraling into the 1929 Great Panic and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed to reverse the decline of the American economy and the Great Panic has created one of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This has fueled the rise of radical politics in America such as the far-left Socialist Party of America, the populist Share the Wealth Society under Huey Long and his national America First Party, and the far-right Old Democratic Party, which places the blame of syndicalist and civil rights uprisings at the feet of immigrants, Republican cosmopolitism and liberal toleration of the left. Hoover's contentious re-election through the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."

ustates.1200.d:0 "The United States Secretary of Commerce Roy D. Chapin has died today due to a severe heart attack. A close ally of Herbert Hoover within the Republican Party, Chapin has desperately attempted to work with businesses, especially those in the motor industry, to undo the severeness of the Great Depression. With Vice President Charles Curtis only having survived his own heart attack earlier this month due to it occuring in the White House with medical staff on stand-by, many see this as both a symbolic and literal example of the old political class passing away in favor of new movements although the Republican Party has protested such claims."

Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Haywood, William H. Murray and Long finally seem to agree on something as they have all railed against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."

ustates.3.t:0 "National Unity Agreement"

Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America, the America First Party, or the Old Democrats would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed by the Republican Party, in which they will nominate a member of both the conservative and progressive wings of their party to their ticket to guarantee a moderate platform. As part of the agreement the Republicans will not run candidates in the “Solid South” to give traditional democrats a better chance and likewise will not run party-endorsed candidates in Progressive heavy areas. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength. Most importantly, all parties agree that whichever party between the three of them wins a plurality of the vote for President will be endorsed by the other two parties for President in the House of Representatives. Despite his lack of public popularity President Hoover is still head of the Republican Party his support would be invaluable to gaining support for the plan from more Senators."

As Wilson remains controversial even within the party this raised a fair amount of debate and angered members of the party who felt Garner was too conservative and out-of-touch to be president. Nonetheless, he has much more support than not within what remains of a Democratic Party that is increasingly being absorbed by either the Old Democrats on its right-wing or the AFP and Progressives on its left.

The Giants are no pushover, however, having stars in home run king Mel Ott and ace pitcher Carl Hubbell. Due to the deteriorating political and economic situation, Americans have turned to baseball as one of the few things that can still bring people of all creeds together as one. At least for a few hours, America can feel normal once more."

ustates.55.d:0 "The Coughlin-Banking Bill is starting a massive fight in Congress, with its goal to establish a Central Bank being fanatically opposed by the ODP and its near-nationalization of private banking by only allowing them to administrate it being opposed by most parties with the exception of the Progressive Party and, in part, the SPA. As the debate drags on Long is increasingly being accused of attempting to shove through the policy on his own terms and of wanting a centralized, tyrannical government, with AFP opponents believing that to hand the AFP control of banking would be handing them the nation despite Long's insistence that the bank directors will be democratically elected. Thankfully however it seems many Americans, especially those in AFP territory, are supportive of the plan and view it as a vindication of the AFP's presentation of Long as a man of the people."
ustates.55.a:0 "The common people are wiser!"

ustates.56.t:0 "AFP Machine Growth"
ustates.56.d:0 "Long has decided to pass the Banking Bill in the most reliable manner he knows how: by playing political games against Washington. Long has used the bully pulpit to decry Congress as corrupt to the bone, calling Sentators by name (to their outrage) and reports have been circulated of increasing bribes to politicians, the gathering of blackmail material, demanding recall elections against opponents in their territory and declaring the Minuteman will receive federal backing as they are 'defenders of democracy'."
ustates.56.a:0 "Sharing our wealth is our only defense!"

ustates.57.t:0 "ODP retreats South"
ustates.57.d:0 "The ODP has had enough of trying to deal with the growing Long Machine that is undermining their influence, with Theodore Bilbo declaring that they intend to defend their representation by any means neccessary. NDWL members have attacked Minutemen in ODP territory and the ODP has overturned all attempts at recall eleciton in their territory. Of course, their ongoing opposition to the banking plan has increased Long's popularity and harmed their own."
ustates.57.a:0 "Bastards!"

ustates.58.t:0 "The Long investigation!"
ustates.58.d:0 "Long has stated that it is obvious those bankers who oppose his plan have made their interests quite clear, and he has stated he will investigate them to the full effect of the law for any un-American corruption they have engaged in. Long has lumped in Standard Oil with these major financial forces, and has stated that he will have any congressmen involved in corrupt dealings with John D. Rockefeller to be arrested and tried by a civilian jury. Naturally major players in Washington are not taking this well, as the investigations are damaging their reputation."
ustates.58.a:0 "I shall defend the interests of the nation"

ustates.59.t:0 "Long Demands Order!"
ustates.59.d:0 "Citing national concerns due to the anarchistic nature of the Socialist Party of America and their Red Guards as well as the continuing economic depression as a result of worker strikes, Huey Long has declared his intention to restore order to the Steel Belt by force if necessary. He has told the Red Guard to stand down so that the government can negotiate an acceptable deal with unions for their payment without the influence of syndicalist radicalism. Naturally the SPA is furious and believe this is further evidence that Long is little more than a reactionary showman."
ustates.59.a:0 "It's the only way!"

ustates.60.t:0 "SPA filibusters Congress!"
ustates.60.d:0 "The SPA have declared their intention to oppose Long's decision to end radicalism through any means available to them, starting with nonstop filibusters in Congress to ensure no legislation passes until he agrees to pull back his forces. Denouncing him as a tyrant and social imperialist capitalist in the papers, it is clear the squeeze on them is hurting them."
ustates.60.a:0 "So be it"

ustates.61.t:0 "Red Guard Barricades Steel Belt"
ustates.61.d:0 "The Red Guard, with support from governors loaning them National Guardsmen, have begun barricading the streets of cities such as Detroit, Chicago and Philadelphia 'to protect the working class from the forces of faux-populist reactionary capitalism' in the words of SPA leader Bill Haywood. As such we are combining the Minutemen with the national guard to take back the cities but the military is upset that Long shoved through his program without consulting him and the ODP is using the opportunity to take pot shots at the SPA and build themselves up without allying Long, seemingly hoping the two will wear each other down."
ustates.61.a:0 "So be it"

ustates.62.t:0 "The Minutemen clash with the SPA"
ustates.62.d:0 "When the Minutemen arrived in the Steel Belt to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the SPA and its supporters. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Steel Belt. It has quickly noticed that the government has no remaining authority within the Steel Belt."

ustates.6200.t:0 "NDWL Declares Long a traitor!"
ustates.6200.d:0 "The National Democratic White League (NDWL) has denounced Long's declaration against the White League and National Klan, with their violent competition for an overlapping voterbase and anger against Long's policies and alliances finally coming to a head. Calling Long a syndicalist in all but name and a demagogue Hiram Wesley Evans has called Long a traitor to the national cause and NDWL leaders have gone underground in their respective states. There is no doubt they are taking a beating however."

ustates.6201.d:0 "When the Minutemen arrived in the Mason-Dixie to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the Old Democrats and its supporters, whom have started a violent insurrection campaign. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the both the Deep South and parts of the North controlled by the Klan. It has quickly noticed that the government has no remaining authority within parts of the South and Mid-East."

ustates.63.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Long"
ustates.63.d:0 "Long's support in D.C has finally bottomed out. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today to restore order, having declared Long to be a tyrant and attempted to arrest him at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the status quo, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, Long was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to New Orleans. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."

### President Murray ###

ustates.6300.t:0 "Murray's Inaugural Address"
ustates.6300.d:0 "The country's social problems have forced the American people to turn to radical solutions; the two-party system has broken down, and William H. Murray is to be sworn in as the 31st president of the United States with John E. Rankin being sworn in as the Vice President with the support of Conservative Democrats and the right-wing "fringe" of the Republican Party giving him just enough support to take Congress. In a stirring speech in Washington DC, Murray has pledged to defend the interest of the American people and to destroy those who would threaten them. Naturally this has outraged the SPA and the ODP's slim coalition in Congress means that it may find it challenging to pass meaningful legislation, especially in the senate where an assortment of Democratic, Republican, Progressive and of course SPA senators have promised to filibuster any law they see as detrimental to America."
ustates.6300.a:0 "God Bless America."

ustates.6301.t:0 "Haywood and Long reinforce militias!"
ustates.6301.d:0 "In response to Murray's inauguration both Bill Haywood and Huey Long have doubled down on reinforcing their respective militias, seemingly dropping any pretense of not offically being their leaders. Condemning Murray as a threat to democracy, Long demands he stay clear of AFP territory while Haywood all but promises future conflict."
ustates.6301.a:0 "Traitors!"

ustates.6302.t:0 "Bankers Resist!"
ustates.6302.d:0 "As the establishment class resists our bill to break up banks and have those in ODP territory controlled by the states, it becomes clear we can not pass our desired legislation through Congress and executive orders will have to suffice. On the plus side, Murray's anti-bank activities has increased his popularity with the common people."
ustates.6302.a:0 "Fools"

ustates.6303.t:0 "Penalizing the corrupt"
ustates.6303.d:0 "It is obvious that the bankers and lobbyists have to much influence in DC, often working for the good of their own pockets than the people. As such Murray has announced he shall dig through every corrupter working against the ODP to find the crimes they have committed and prosecute them whenever possible. Of course, this announcement has set off a firestorm of hatred among the other parties but will weaken the corrupt establishment."
ustates.6303.a:0 "Good!"

ustates.6304.t:0 "Rockefeller Investigated!"
ustates.6304.d:0 "The Oil Tycoon John D. Rockefeller has aligned himself with Republican politics and greed for too long, and now he is paying the price of putting profit among national brotherhood. Employees of Rankin and Ford have found evidence of price-fixing and undercutting competitors. Despite the outcries of his agents is time to announce we intend to put him on trial, and every congressman who has connections to him."
ustates.6304.a:0 "Good!"

ustates.6306.t:0 "Smith Act Blocked!"
ustates.6306.d:0 "The Smith Act would simultaneously end non-white and non-protestant immigration to the United States while reintroducing forms of segregation to the North, including banning Whites from marrying Jews and those with more a quarter of black blood. However the act has virtually no chance of passing Congress as basically only ODP congressmen and a handful of breakaways from other parties are willing to vote for it. As such an executive order will need to be enacted."
ustates.6306.a:0 "They forced our hand!"

ustates.6307.t:0 "Congress Protests!"
ustates.6307.d:0 "Congress is openly protesting our most recent executive accusing Murray of being an extremist demagogue. Already the AFP and SPA are mobilizing against us and the Establishment appears to be making negotiations with the military to restrain Murray. It appears as though we are being literally forced from office in short time although our executive acts has made us even more popular among those who leaned towards us."
ustates.6307.a:0 "Traitors!"

ustates.6308.t:0 "MacArthur forces out Murray"
ustates.6308.d:0 "William H. Murray's time is up as he has fled for the ODP controlled Georgia after hearing of MacArthur's clique planning to coup him. MacArthur has announced that Murray and all other radicals threatening America will have to stand down and allow a return to ordinary democratic politics, basically demanding that all militias disband and accept the constitution."
ustates.6308.a:0 "This is the only way"

ustates.6309.t:0 "Hitting Long"
ustates.6309.d:0 "Huey Long's Minutemen have come under increasing attack in recent days, and the ODP is loudly denouncing the congressmen aligned with them. With our attempts to occupy the Midwest incuring the wrath of the AFP and resulting in guerilla attacks on ODP militants in turn, we have been more succesful in weeding out Share Our Wealth socieities in the deep South. The SPA have fought our attempts to bring troops into the Steel Belt to attack the AFP however out of paranoia that they are actually there to fight the Red Guard, or at least will be once we're done with Long. Long himself has left Congress for Louisiana and already Congress is upset as they view Murray as using federal forces to empower the ODP by stomping on his enemies, fully expecting him to come for them next."
ustates.6309.a:0 "That ought to teach him a lesson."

ustates.6310.t:0 "Hitting Haywood"
ustates.6310.d:0 "Our strikes on the Red Guard in the Steel Belt has been met with enthusiastic applause among the ODP, mixed reactions among the Democrats and of course total aversion by the SPA whom believe that we will soon be coming after them as well which is basically correct as we hold them to account for their attacks on America. While the SPA has taken a beating in the Steel Belt they are striking back as Red Guards resort to Guerilla warfare although we have eradicated the holdouts in the Southeast who were giving the ODP trouble. Most establishment members of Congress however view this as basically irresponsible and dangerous, with a widespread conspiracy theory amongst them that Murray is just using their forces against Haywood to cement the ODP's power before likely turning on them."
ustates.6310.a:0 "We'll break Haywood in short order"

ustates.6311.t:0 "The General Strike Spreads"
ustates.6311.d:0 "With the Red Guard slowly building strength against us and our insaction, the SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. Meanwhile Long's AFP has likewise been coordinating against us. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces, Old Democrats or even with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention. Soon war will be coming."
ustates.6311.a:0 "A disaster!"

### President Curtis/Landon ###

ustates.64.t:0 "Presidential Inauguration"
ustates.64.dc:0 "After his election, Curtis addressed the nation. Curtis called for patience and civility in these difficult times. Curtis was quoted as saying 'A nation cannot be preserved which does not preserve its citizens. Industry is reducing wages, lowering the standard of living, destroying buying power, this cannot be the way we solve our economic problems.' Reinvigorated with his unlikely victory, Curtis boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary. Whether the rest of the nation would listen to the message was another story."
ustates.64.dl:0 "Alf Landon was sworn in as the 31st president of the United States of America today. At his inaugural address Landon spoke of the challenges facing the nation in preserving a liberal democacy. Landon was quoted as saying 'Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization. And I think I will awaken America to that.' Landon concluded with a promise to solve the Depression with entrepreneurship. Creating a new generation of millionaires that will bring pride back to the nation. Whether anyone will listen is another matter."
ustates.64.dz:0 "Herbert Hoover was sworn in again as the president of the United States of America today. President Hoover Inauguration speech called for calm in these times of difficulty and how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Hoover is quoted as saying "America is a great social and economic experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose.""
ustates.64.a:0 "America is One Nation Indivisible!"

ustates.65.t:0 "Republicans Announce Negotiations"
ustates.65.dc:0 "President Curtis has announced that his first priority as president is to end the most recent strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Bill Haywood in Chicago to negotiate. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers. Our negotiators believe that Curtis's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA, but President Curtis is determined."

ustates.66.t:0 "Haywood Accepts Invitation"
ustates.66.d:0 "Bill Haywood has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. An FBI intelligence file on Haywood indicates that he and other SPA leaders were worried that their right-wing would defect if he outright turned it down meaning he is less than thrilled to be present but must make at least a show of quasi-good will. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of the President's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavour. They say he is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
ustates.66.a:0 "I survived a heart attack, I can handle this"
ustates.66.b:0 "Good, the Republic may survive after all"

ustates.67.t:0 "Negotiations Begin"
ustates.67.dc:0 "Curtis gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'With these negotiations we continue the great American tradition of achieving peace through compromise, progress through understanding and democracy through mutual agreement. May our efforts today fulfill the spirit of the Constitution and preserve the liberty of all Americans.' President Curtis and Bill Haywood have sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago. Though mid-starting the negotiations word arrived that both Huey Long and (upon hearing of Long's request) William H. Murray have demanded to be at the negotiations despite our diplomats already telling them they would be seen after Haywood. Their presence will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing could incite the AFP and ODP to such a degree as to make success in Chicago worthless. Even Haywood himself seems to want them to be present if only to be certain that Curtis will tell them all the same thing without giving the others too much."
ustates.67.dl:0 "Landon gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'Many are concerned that talking to ones adversies is a form of weakness.

ustates.68.t:0 "Desire for Autonomy"
ustates.68.d:0 "Haywood, Long and Murray have made it clear they believe the working man is being stiffed but have wildly different ways of achieving their goals. However, the Home Rule plans to allow each to implment their ideas in their respective regions. Haywood demands that we make a show of goodwill by ending all attempts to end the general strike, essentially pulling much of our forces out of the region. The AFP and ODP have stated that if we are to follow through on such a thing we will have to do the same for them and order MacArthur's military forces to stand down. Of course Haywood nearly blew up the negotations by stating that pulling forces away from ODP strongholds would simply make it easier for the Red Guard to eventually overrun them but it was a threat Murray simply chuckled at and invited him to try his best. After Long and the President reminded both men that the US Army remained the issue at hand they thankfully stopped their fighting for the moment."
ustates.68.a:0 "Very Well"
ustates.68.b:0 "Haywood needs to make a better offer"

ustates.69.t:0 "D.C. Denounced"
ustates.69.d:0 "With their rejection from the meeting, William H. Murray and Huey Long have both denounced President [USA.GETLeader] for meeting with an "anarchist" before them. Both are riling their supporters, with the AFP demanding for Long to be allowed into the meeting room and the ODP already declaring D.C. a corrupt establishment beyond salvation, caving into radicalism. Governors and Congressman from their respective factions are already nodding in agreement with these sentiments and are reportedly outright meeting with their respective militia leaders. Haywood, upon hearing this, has decided to return to the Steel Belt to organize the SPA, demanding that President [USA.GETLeader] put down both the ODP and AFP in the meantime if Curtis wants him to return. It's unlikely that such a thing is possible without Civil War, however."

ustates.6900.d.c:0 "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepreneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. Now that he has attempted to close ranks with big business Haywood and the SPA view this as the smoking gun that Landon is a traitor to people. Though to many these accusations have rang hollow citing Landon as a man with the business connections attempting to improve the economy, the radicals seem convinced."

While he supported negotiations as a step in the right direction he also recently spoke about how President [USA.GETLeader] only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of [USA.GETLeader]'s fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. The President, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish baboon - much to the AFP's outrage."

ustates.70.t:0 "Funding Demanded"
ustates.70.d:0 "As the meeting in Chicago began in earnest, it quickly became clear that all of the men present had only one factor in common: to bring back something of benefit to their constituents. They have demanded that each of their parties be given a lump cash subsidy by the government for fighting the depression. While this will be a show of goodwill and they will all walkout if refused, it threatens to empower radicals should the negotations fail. And, of course, none of them will be happy to see the others getting funding, meaning we will have to concede more in the negotiations."
ustates.70.a:0 "Agree"
ustates.70.b:0 "Disagree"

ustates.71.t:0 "Murray's Demands"
ustates.71.d:0 "Despite having a reputation of being a 'fighter' known for making outrageous and offensive statements in public, Old Democrat leader William H. Murray is very clearly more shrewd in private. He has unsurprisingly fought tooth and nail to keep Long and Haywood from getting more power in their home regions but before they gave up on him he finally has an offer for everyone at the table. If the Socialists and AFP "pull out" from the Old Democrats regions and instead invite their most prominent supporters to live in their own regions, he will vote for increased autonomy. However, with this autonomy he wants Federal investigations into the White Leagues within the Mason-Dixie line reduced, calling this a 'local matter', and a public promise for the President to respect states rights. Finally, on top of all this, he wants a substantial investment into the rural South... by giving yet another large grant for Murray and the ODP to do with as they see fit. This would effectively ensure the Old Democrats rule from Indiana to Florida for the foreseeable future but it is the only hope for the Home Plan to work."

ustates.7100.t:0 "Radicals Upset!"
ustates.7100.d:0 "Haywood and his entourage are upset that we have agreed to Murray's demands to give the Old Democrats greater control of his region, viewing it as a betrayal of the workers whom have supported him in the region. Long on the other hand seems willing to agree so long as there is a 'ceasefire' between the two, meaning that Long will not work to expand his influence among the Old Democrats but will keep those party machines which already exist and will 'suggest' (as he 'officially' has no control over them) the Minutemen cease aggressive acts between them. AFL leader Samuel Gompers has been called into a meeting between the President and Haywood to delegate between the two and he came up with his own compromise. While the SPA will cease to encourage growth in the south they will be given even greater control of the North, a large grant to do what they wish with, protectionism shall stay the norm with the Entente and the federal Government will make no attempt to cease the so-called 'Combined Syndicates' from aiding the syndicalist movement in other parts of the world. Haywood has reluctantly agreed believing it will aid more workers in the long-run and, of course, it is likely he believes the Syndicalist Movement can liberate the American South once he can help it become the unipolar ideology of the world. The only question now is if the Republicans will agree. Of course Long has seen an opening to also demand that the AFP be compensated for going along with this deal with a larger grant which they can spend on their rural and unemployed supporters."

It is unlikely that peace, democracy or respect for the Federal Government can last if these militias continue to grow. The Republican cabinet has requested that each faction cease funding militia recruitment outside their territory and that militias register with state governments and are therefor legally accountable and regulated. Others in Congress want them disarmed at once however, stating that it's the only way to ensure peace. While the faction leaders have agreed to the former so long as the others yank out of 'their' regions it is unlikely they would go with the latter, though MacArthur has suggested that if we blindsided them and disarmed the militias at once they would have to go with it. Few others are confident this plan would work."

The Socialists now currently transitioning Chicago and Detroit to semi-syndicalist systems where workers are universally unionized and own shares of production, the AFP have begun implementing a smaller and local variant of Share the Wealth and the ODP have implemented a combination of more "nativist" laws and anti-corporate policies in the American Southeast. While many within the cabinet do not like giving them control even to this degree this level of decentralization has defused each while allowing us to focus on the West and East where the federal government is still most influential while disarming them of being an outright threat on the national level while giving each major constituency what they want."

He has declared [USA.GETLeader] to be in league with Haywood and Long, the government to have failed to represent Americans, and that America's very soul was in jeopardy. While government officials attempted to urge calm, Murray's words have struck a chord across the nation, especially the South, firing up ODP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them. With Murray and the ODP raising hell, Long and Haywood are both returning home to guide their respective parties, claiming they will only return when the ODP threat is contained."

With the perception that compromise attempts have failed while various extremists continued to garner power, [USA.GETLeader]'s own cabinet has lost its confidence that any resolution would be reached with the most recent outbreak of hostilities. With the cabinet's apparent co-operation and a military clique backing him, General Douglas MacArthur took charge of an emergency administration intended to 'preserve the country from extremist forces, before we are completely overrun'. Of course this has only confirmed to the various radicals and populists that the US government was beyond saving, although MacArthur's soldiers seem prepared to fight. While the government is attempting to reassure the American public that all is under control, most are looking on in shock. Civil war appears imminent. The question remains of what the President himself should do?"

Some such as Norman Thomas has urged the AFL and IWW strikers to resist without violence but this hasn't always worked - especially when the strikers are simultaneously provoked by Old Democrat and Federalist supporters. Haywood has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. 'What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed," Haywood declared in a Minneapolis speech. 'What they get instead is a government that acts at the behast of their capitalist overlords.

Several Minutemen training centers in Alabama and South Carolina were raided by police in recent days, and Old Democrat meetings have been constantly harrassed - or so Klan Leader Hiram Wesley Evans has loudly complained. 'The federal government has opted for open tyranny,' he said. 'They will do anything to keep us down, when what we seek is a government that is worthy of us!'

The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces, Old Democrats or even with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest.

In the end, over forty Guardsmen were killed as well as an unknown number of Minutemen. Huey Long and the AFP denied involvement with the militia, but questioned the presence of the National Guard in what should clearly have been a police matter. The militia, they claim, were merely defending themselves.

Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving five dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the 'Pittsburgh Massacre' and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with SPA militia throughout the region. Newspapers across the country have 'civil war' splashed across their headlines, and public panic is at a crescendo."
ustates.84.a:0 "What next?"

ustates.85.t:0 "March on Detriot"
ustates.85.d:0 "The Old Democrats, America First Party, Socialist Party of America and National Guard have once again come into conflict in Michigan when Old Democrats sought to take the Socialists to task for causing yet another strike that is exasperrating the economy. Old Democrat leaders blamed the weakness of the government in not finishing off "revolutionary leftists" and opposing the efforts of the Old Democrats to complete the goals of Woodrow Wilson and Arnold Palmer in finishing off the radicals and that the distant Federal Government bureaucrats was instead sympathetic to them and the AFP's "false egalitarianism". The official Old Democrat newsletter went on to blame the AFP and  for encouraging political corruption and the growth of the bureaucratic state while denouncing minorities in the government and which both the AFP and Socialist Party collaborate with. They ended by saying that they were organizing a march on Detroit to protest socialist behavior."

In response Huey Long, whom no doubt did not care for Murray's insults against him and Haywood being in the spotlight, announced that Minutemen would be present to show Americans that true Americanism is still present in these dark times and to protect American citizens from the Old Democrats and Socialists. While all sides have been criticized for their behavior and possible motives there is little doubt this will end badly."
ustates.86.a:0 "We will do what we can"

ustates.87.t:0 "Detroit Bloodbath"
ustates.87.d:0 "The March ended nearly as quickly as it began and, as expected, was a disaster. The SPA and Old Democrats are blaming one another for firing the first shot and it is uncertain which of the two started the outright fighting but regardless the Federal Government, Minutemen, Socialists and Old Democrats began fighting amongst each other once the rioting broke out between them and few could tell one another from each other. Eventually however it became clear that the SPA had too many supporters in the area and the other factions had to retreat. The country is quickly breaking down as the body count is well over 200 and the Federal Governments weakness has been utterly exposed and no side can rely on them to keep order against the others. On top of this the National Guard is being blamed in the papers for civilian deaths alongside the other factions, depending on which parties newsletter is doing the printing."
ustates.87.a:0 "Now what?"

ustates.88.t:0 "Compromise Fails!"
ustates.88.d:0 "It appears we were too cocky. While our first few raids on militia headquarters went off without a hitch we failed when attempting to arrest a group of Minutemen in Southern Missouri, resulting in a shootout that kill 34 men, 12 national guardmen and 22 minutemen. The ODP and SPA militants became even more paranoid we were planning to actually wipe them all out and have likewise fired back at our boys. Willam H. Murray, Bill Haywood and Huey Long can now finally agree on one thing; that we are not to be trusted. They have fled home to doubtlessly prepare a counter-attack before habeus corpus is likely suspended."

ustates.91.d:0 "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Garner was quoted as saying 'We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.' On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893. Garner enters the White House surrounded by hostile AFP and SPA Senators as well as wary Republicans, though he has assured the public that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
ustates.91.a:0 "God Save America"

ustates.9100.t:0 "President Announces Hard Line"
ustates.9100.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destabilize America. He has ordered all rioters in the Steel Belt to return home and likewise for all AFP minutemen and ODP militants to stand down before military action is taken. All SPA, AFP and ODP Senators walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
ustates.9100.a:0 "We will win"

ustates.9101.t:0 "J. Edgar Hoover's Proposal"
ustates.9101.d:0 "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [USA.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP, SPA, and ODP can become more organized. A prosecution of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it is centered around his personality. A prosecution of Bill Haywood, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. Putting William Murray in prison would certainly create doubt among his supporters, and perhaps end the ODP threat entirely. There are also reasons to pursue D.C. Stephenson or Earl Browder, less powerful members of their respective factions, but still important figures we could find something on. This would de-legitimize the faction we decide to go after, but it may not be enough to end the crisis. Still, if the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."

ustates.9103.t:0 "Military Action Prepared!"
ustates.9103.d:0 "Our military is prepared to defend the Republic from the radicals! The only question now is where to use it? Anti-radicals have suggested using the bulk of the military to occupy the syndicalist occupied territory that is still striking while the cabinet would like to spread out the forces more and occupy all three radical factions. George Marshall however would like to split the difference, placing most of our military in the Steel Belt while using counter-espionage in other territories to prevent an immediate revolt, though he warns this will only buy time as they are likely already announcing a revolt against the President's hardline and out of fear that Garner will come after them once the SPA is finished."

ustates.9105.t:0 "Dealing with the Steel Belt"
ustates.9105.d:0 "The SPA's attacks have slowed with our increase of troops damaging their efforts and leading to counter attacks on their militia headquarters under MacArthur and Eisenhower. However while the Red Militias have weakened and the government has gained legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens of the Steel Belt the workers have not yet been won over to our side, with many still refusing to work even if they are not outright SPA members. Hardliners such as Alvin M. Owlsey and Harry F. Byrd have been encouraged by our recent success and are pushing for us to finish the job by cracking down on the rest of the strikers and unions so that industry may hire new workers or they learn not to engage in such behavior. However Vice President Al Smith and other cabinet members are pushing for us to cut a deal with industry leaders to raise wages in return for protection from the militias noting that most of these workers are not natural militants if they were treated fairly and SPA support can be undercut in the process."

With entire platoons of National Guardsmen being overrun, guerilla attacks, larger riots and barriers being set up by the Red Militia in the streets of Chicago and Detroit we are forced to fallback to Washington DC. MacArthur is furious at the situation feeling victory could have been attained if the government hadn't fumbled the situation and the radicals will soon be on our doorstep due to Garner and his advisors.

Stephenson's corruption, which includes him and his circle engaging in alcohol, drugs, intimidation, 'relations' with minors, sexual assault, and murder. While it is unclear why Hoover kept this information to himself, he may have been hedging his bets to use this information as a bargaining chip. Despite [USA.GetLeader]'s disgust with Hoover for not pursuing this earlier, it is obvious that publishing this and bringing Stephenson to court could discredit the Klan."
ustates.9108.a:0 "Arrest Stephenson"

ustates.92.t:0 "The Austerity Bill"
ustates.92.d:0 "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards non-army based military spending and federal spending on construction projects. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression and attempted to boost market confidence by stating that the cut was partially due to the belief of his cabinet that the Depression was already coming to an end, and it was met with mostly skepticism and jeers from radical Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country by reinvigorating private investor confidence in the nation."
ustates.92.a:0 "Believe in America"

ustates.93.t:0 "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
ustates.93.d:0 "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a Louisiana speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist and reactionary rhetoric. Long said he would be directing the AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."

ustates.94.t:0 "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
ustates.94.d:0 "A demonstration in Washington D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Bill Haywood condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."

While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and while there are enough Republican and ODP Senators remaining on the fence, passage may prove unlikely without intervention. It is possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans and hope that enough Old Democrats break party line to vote for the bill. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"

With our agents being increasingly rooted out in NDWL organizations, they have finally retaliated by assassinating several FBI agents at their supposed "Safehouse" in Atanta, with White Leaguers opening fire from outside with shotguns. The NDWL is openly organizing against us, aware that we are coming for them and that our forces are still stuck in the Steel Belt."

However, the Progressives are increasingly being reabsorbed by the Republicans with George Norris, Hiram Johnson, and others returning to the Republican fold. Meanwhile the Old Democrats and White Leagues are still present in the American Southeast but most are more or less either rejoining the Democrats or becoming relegated to the fringe elsewhere. SPA no longer commands the power it once did with its revolutionary tendencies being discredited and it's unlikely they will hold any seat higher than the House of Representatives for long. It seems the stability of the two-party system has been preserved at the national level and the radicals have been displaced."

Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. Garner's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent. Garner himself is forced to choose between fleeing the nation or accepting his new role as a President-in-name only."

ustates.107.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Norris has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a comission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. The Progressives believe this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared support for the bill despite believing it does not go far enough and believing it may be too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. The ODP meanwhile claim this is just another way for federal liberals to empower wealthy cosmopolitans and progressives in D.C. at the expense of Americans, calling for banks to be broken up and handed to native citizens on the state level. We may have to modify the bill to get more of the AFP and SPA on board, of which Quentin Roosevelt has proposed to retroactively investigate those who may have commited fraud and charge them to show we are the not the same people as the corrupt elements of the business community who caused this crash as well as our committment to justice."

Haywood on the other hand had more radical demands, demanding support for workers coops, urban spending, the release of a laundry list of SPA activists who were arrested for various relatively petty crimes and government protection of unions.

The act was applauded by the notably extreme South Carolina governor Coleman Blease, an affiliate of the so-called "Old Klan" who has stated that South Carolia will not stand for a "Second Reconstruction" and that retribution is inevitable. Arresting him is likely to incite a revolt but some progressives are pressing us to do so. For what his opinion is worth, MacArthur believes that it would be dangerous to arrest the governor and that it would put his men at further risk."

Nonetheless while occupation has prevented an outright uprising it is clear that without the Klan losing support through other means we can not finish the job or hold on forever. Today however J. Edgar Hoover has alerted us that he has evidence of Indiana Klan Leader D.C. Stephenson's corruption, which includes him and his circle engaging in alcohol, drugs, intimidation, 'relations' with minors, sexual assault, and murder. While it is clear Hoover is interested in being rewarded for this find with increased FBI presence it is nonetheless neccessary to play along as publishing this and bringing Stephenson to court could discredit the Klan."

Both Simmons and Evans will likely stand trial soon. Meanwhile NDWL numbers are collapsing since the Stephenson scandal, with this recent action only accelerating its collapse. In Congress some ODP members such as Edward E.

Stephenson however has requested that we take the death penalty off the table, in return for giving up the names of prominent Klan members and testifying against their activities.

A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a national labor relations board. This board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang.

This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocracy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J.

The rivalry between the army and navy has long been known and has only grown since MacArthur took power. William D. Leahy is in particular disgusted by the decision of MacArthur to keep power, and on top of the existing demands wants for MacArthur to keep out of Congressional elections. Meanwhile, Ernest King is reported to be filled with rage at MacArthur's constant attempts to exercise more control (and general army superiority) over the Navy. While army insiders hate the demands Leahy has made, we may have to accept for the moment to keep these wings of the admirality in-line."

Worse, he tires of the relentless orders coming from MacArthur's office, seeing him as no better than himself, and believing the army has no right to control the navy. Though King's criticisms are not the same as Leahy's, it seems that both men are threats that will need to be dealt with if we are to have a stable regime and ultimately win the war. Taking note of Leahy's antagonism towards MacArthur, King has come to MacArthur with an offer to take the whole of the navy in a bid to make it run more efficiently, while also guaranteeing some sort of stability in this branch. However, other admirals warn that King is an even less trustworthy advisor than Leahy, and that he seeks his own gain. J. Edgar Hoover has offered to be the one to find a way to get rid of Admiral King if need be, but given his talent, we cannot indulge this offer.

They have taken notice of a young actor who has been particularly vocal in his support of the Federalist cause named Ronald Reagan, whom has been selected to host the program if it is approved given the story of him moving East in support of us is in-and-of-itself making the rounds.

Reed, Foster, Browder and the other high priests of the syndicalist cause believe that by robbing their citizens of freedom they are paving the way for a glorious new future, as we've seen in the case of the equally tyrannical Commune of France and Union of Britain, which have both exiled their own citizens and do no allow a word spoken against their regimes. Now, I hope I don't have to tell you how lucky we are to live in such a territory with the protection of the Red, White and Blue but just in case, we are lucky indeed. So next time you go to your home, or your job, remember what could happen if the Combined Syndicalists win, and what you can do to prevent that! That's Radio America from Ronald Reagan, signing out."

Apparently, raids on Black Territory in the South by the KKK are commonplace, where they commit all manner of unholy behavior.

Leahy, believing that the military should largely stay out of politics, has protested MacArthur's restrictions on Congress, arguing that they endanger the very principles the country was founded on. Recently, in what appears to have been a watershed moment, MacArthur announced that the military would take a role in congressional elections as well, causing Leahy to lead disgruntled politicians, admirals, and even some army men to coup the government. \n\nDouglas MacArthur was arrested during the coup, and with the coup being almost bloodless, it seems like an excellent outcome for what was certainly an extremely risky maneuver. However, Leahy must now contend with the rest of the United States; Bradley and Eisenhower in the WCC, perhaps sympathizing with Leahy's cause but unlikely to approve of a navy dominant over the army, the pretender regime on the West Coast, and the various extremist factions that threaten to tear this nation apart. Regardless, Leahy has the support of much of Washington, and it seems that even Ernest King has agreed to fall in line behind Leahy's leadership, viewing him as one of the only men he would ever follow.

Since then though, King has chafed under the command of MacArthur, viewing his constant dismissals of the navy as disrespectful and a danger to the war effort. Though MacArthur ultimately relented and gave King control over the navy recently, it seems the move was only an attempt by King to gain more power, and it was ultimately successful. King, with the support of Leahy and several disgruntled generals, led a coup in Washington today, arresting Douglas MacArthur and taking the entirety of the government within a few short hours. \n\nNow, King must face the war MacArthur started, and though little time has passed, it already seems that King will face significant roadblocks to a victory in the Civil War. The WCC, led by Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, is unlikely to give much support to King, viewing him as merely another iteration of MacArthur, and since he wears a navy uniform rather than an army one, they are even less likely to be supportive. Meanwhile, the Pacific is sure to see this coup as merely another justification for the existence of their own regime, arguing that true stability exists in the West. Beyond these groups, the various extremists that run roughshot over our rightful territory must also be dealt with. The future is unclear..."

Admiral King has denounced these men, arguing that their loyalty was to a man and not the country, and that perhaps they are of better use in the West. What no side has mentioned is that this is only the latest development in the seemingly growing rivalry between the army and navy, now taking place in the form of the Western Command Center against the United States government. Dwight Eisenhower has been said to take a personal disliking to King, viewing his arrogance and aggression as unbecoming of an American admiral. For his part, Omar Bradley has largely remained quiet on King, but it seems that neither Eisenhower nor Bradley has a favorable opinion of the man in Washington. Never before in U.S. history has the divide between army and navy been so apparent, and it is sure to be a cause for tension for years after the war unless we act quickly..."

ustates.150.t:0 "The Twentieth Amendment"
ustates.150.d:0 "The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution has been proposed. This amendment would make it so that the President of the United States of America is elected by the direct popular suffrage of the country. The current Electoral College system was last modified in the 14th Amendment almost a century ago. The bill, as proposed by a minority coalition of Social Democrats within the Republicans and Democrats has very little chance of succeeding. It is claimed by the supporters that doing this will help prevent another crisis like the 1936 crisis from happening again. The party leadership of both e Republicans and Democrats disagree, saying that the Electoral College was the only thing that kept the United States from totally dissolving in 1936. A long week of debating has left every avenue explored, and ultimately..... "

ustates.152.d:0 "During the 1930s, a large part of the NAACP's activities were taken up by litigation in favour of African American rights. This was due to the retreating strength of the black vote and the diminishing ability of African Americans to reach office after Plessy v. Ferguson. This avenue was also pursued by the syndicalist aligned International Labor Defence, who countered the NAACP for a decade in a competition for the hearts of black voters. Seeing no other option and being unwilling to ever compromise with socialists, NAACP leader Walter Francis White has decided to cooperate with the FBI in an anti-socialist public relations campaign. Whether this truly motivates civil rights or further dilutes the current remains to be seen."

A proposed civil works program to electrify the Southwest using hydroelectric power hit a snag as Democrats could not agree on the role of public works in the marketplace. The Works would be able to undercut private electricity companies because it would be able to cross state borders and build dams on public land.

The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun.

ustates.190.d.progs:0 "It has been almost four years since George Norris took office, and though he began his term residing over a collapsing nation, he was able to act quickly and prevent a Civil War from breaking out. While the Norris-Roosevelt ticket is wildly popular among the Progressive base, his re-election is not guaranteed. Four years ago, after tense negotiations, Huey Long and Jack Reed endorsed the Progressive Party, and they may hold the key to it's re-election chances. Securing their support will be vital. Meanwhile, it appears that ideological struggles will characterize this year's Democratic and Republican primaries. Those who agree with many of Norris's reforms argue that embracing some of them is the only way to beat the Progressives in November, while those who vehemently oppose the Square Deal argue that making their own policy arguments is the only way to win. Even if the parties haven't decided how to run against Norris, it is clear he has made an enemy in the media. Whatever Norris does, it seems that the newspapers cover it unfavorably, and this may pose a problem for him in the election. Regardless though, both Norris and Roosevelt have signaled their enthusiasm for continuing their work in office, and hope to usher the U.S. into a new age of prosperity."
ustates.190.d.landon:0 "In just a few years, President Alf Landon has reversed the dismal fortunes of the Republican Party handed to him by Herbert Hoover. The Landon Plan has differed from Hoover's approach mainly in that Landon blames tariffs for America's economic woes, and hence has pursued a more free-trade approach. While this plan, in addition to domestic stimulus programs, has largely helped Americans recover, there is no guarantee the Republicans will be re-elected in November. It is a rare thing in American politics to see one party be elected four consecutive times, and the country has certainly changed from the days of Hoover's first term. The insurgent third parties that ran in 1936 have largely dissipated, yet their leaders are still influential, and they have focused their critiques on the impact of Landon's trade policies. Long and Reed have lambasted Landon for policies they insist have hurt farmers and workers at the benefit of corporations, while Murray has argued that Landon's policies only benefit the cosmopolitan elite class. Meanwhile, while the Progressives have largely echoed the critiques of Reed and Long, the Democrats have crafted their own message, painting Landon as an out-of-touch Easern elitist who couldn't hope to understand the plight of the everyday American. The results of such criticisms are yet to be seen, but it is clear that Landon may have a tough season ahead of him."

For one thing, the insurgent parties from the last election have largely disappeared, but their leaders have not. Reed and Long have criticized Curtis's programs for being pro-worker on  the surface only, and representing business interests in truth. Meanwhile, Murray has characterized Curtis's reforms as a capitulation to syndicalists. The mainstream Democrats, after years of failure on the national level, are experincing a struggle for the soul of the party, with reform-minded liberals hoping to take control of the party and the still-mighty conservatives hoping to retain power. Regardless of their faction though, nearly all Democrats have criticized Curtis's programs as tyrannical and violating the rights of states and the terms agreed on in the "Home Rule Negotiations". Curtis has a difficult election ahead of him, but with any luck, he will lead the party to victory once again."
ustates.190.d.garner:0 "John Nance Garner has beaten every political enemy he has faced in his first term in office, but new ones have risen to challenge his power. Largely seen as a humble and unassuming man, Garner is a political intriguer in reality, often making backroom deals to achieve his goals. His program of "Austerity through the Storm" as well as the political strategy of repressing the leftist radicals of the North and Midwest has been successful, and order has finally been restored to a battered nation. However, the battle is not yet over for Garner. If he wants to win re-election, he will have to deal with leaders of the now-defunct ODP party, who still hold sway over millions of voters and who are bitter at their treatment in recent years. At the same time, many ODP voters have switched over to the Democratic Party, where they have traditionally been, and even much of the ODP leadership has complimented Garner's emphasis on rooting out syndicalism in the country. Still, there is much ground to be covered before official reunification of the two Democratic factions is achieved. In the meantime, while Reed and Long have been silenced, the Republican Party is as strong as ever, marshaling the outrage of northerners and coastal elites against what they see as a dirty, simple, and crass man who is unfit to be president. It is this hatred by northeastern elites in particular that may trouble Garner in his re-election, and the Catholics who voted for him in the last election may be less excited for his second term after his adoption of some ODP anti-Catholic rhetoric. Further, the party machines in that region of the country, dissatisfied by Garner's lack of civility and his sheer conservatism, will surely drag their feet in mobilizing urban Democrats. Many of these elites look down on Garner, and already predict a Republican victory in November. For his part, Garner is determined to show the world just how wrong they are, and he is confident the party can achieve victory. Time will tell whether he is correct, however..."
ustates.190.d.deadlocknorris:0 "It has been nearly four years since the last election, yet the wounds left from that disaster have not healed. When it became clear that no candidate had secured enough support to win outright, the House of Representatives chose the leader of the country for the second time in a row. George Norris and Quentin Roosevelt were decided on as a compromise ticket, a move that most congressmen saw as magnanimous, as they actually despised Norris's platform. The decision was only made in an effort to appease Longists, Syndicalists, and Progressives themselves, whose combined vote tally surpassed that of the Republicans and Democrats. However, the decision to make him president was not received well by the nation's right-wing, particularly the ODP and the South as a whole. The Democratic Party, after years of losses and ineffectiveness, has lost most of its old base, who have flocked to the ODP instead. Even worse, William Murray has convinced millions nationwide to join him in forming a new "National People's Party". With its new support, the party poses a true threat to Norris's re-election chances. Norris has turned out to be an effective president, acting quickly to prevent a collapse and even helping the nation to recover from the Great Depression, but with a weak Republican Party and an insurgent National People's Party, can he hang on?" 
ustates.190.d.deadlockgarner:0 "When the House of Representatives chose a president for the second time in a row, the decision was not well-received among the nation's left-wing. The House chose their former speaker, Democrat John Nance Garner, and his running mate Al Smith to win the election. The decision was made in the hopes that Garner would eliminate some of the more radical elements in the country while also having an established record in Washington. Further, Garner earned more votes than any other candidate, but it was still not enough to win outright. In his first term, Garner has been able to successfully defuse the national tension before armed conflict broke out, and also save the economy from ruin. However, he has not been as successful on the political front. The House's decision to select another president was most bitterly denounced by Huey Long and Jack Reed. The two have begun their own party in the time since the election, calling it the Populist Party in a nod to the old party of the same name. They have grown to a size that will make them Garner's main opponent in November, with the increasingly irrelevant Republican Party posing little challenge. Can Garner hang on against the Republicans and the insurgent Populist Party?"

It would be best to have the first be a good orator  but not a firebrand so as to not take the wind out of the sails of those to follow, and two options have been pushed from each side. \n\nReed originally pushed for Eugene Dennis to give the first speech, but this was met with firm resistance from the anti-socialists within the Longist camp. His next offer was William Green, the more moderate union leader, who would be also be a more satisfying choice for the Long camp, though Green's rival John L. Lewis was seen to leave the convention in a fury after the name was suggested. \n\nFrom the Longist camp, the first suggestion was Robert LaFollette Jr., brother of Wisconsin Governor Philip LaFollette. Off the back of a number of disputes with his brother, and his appointment as the administrator of  "Share our Wealth" in the Great Lakes region, "Young Bob" has stepped out of Philip’s shadow to become the champion of a distinctly Mid-Western brand of Longism. Given these credentials, few were surprised when Reed strongly opposed giving the floor to LaFollette Jr. What did come as a shock was his suggestion that perhaps Philip LaFollette should speak instead. While Governor LaFollette is no friend of Reed, he was also once considered a rival for Long in dominating the hearts and minds of much of Middle America, and as such, he is likely to be tepid in his support of the Longist wing of the party. \n\nAs the crowd continues to grow wilder, the moment has now come to decide which of these four men will open the convention."

It would be best to have the first be a good orator, but not a firebrand, so as to not take the wind out of the sails of those to follow, and two options have been pushed from each side. \n\nLindbergh originally pushed for his ally, famous industrialist Henry Ford, to give the first speech, but this was met with strong opposition from the populists in Murray’s camp. His next offer was William Randolph Hearst Jr., largely due to his father’s contributions in bringing the NPP to the attention of the American public. \n\nFrom Murray’s camp, the initial nomination was Gerald L. K. Smith, the radical Christian and populist. Though once aligned with Long’s AFP, Smith broke with them after their left-ward turn towards Norris, preferring to focus more firmly on campaigning for Christian and anti-Semitic positions. Smith has thus come to be aligned with the NPP, even if he has not fully been accepted by them. To no one’s surprise, Lindbergh and Hearst both voiced their firm opposition to giving the pulpit to a man who once coordinated Share Our Wealth efforts. Murray’s compromise suggestion was something of a surprise, as he nominated Samuel Green, Georgia native and one of the most prominent leaders of the much diminished Ku Klux Klan. Though the KKK remains mired in controversy, Green is a middle-class professional with a reputation for rejecting some of the flamboyancy of previous Klan leaders, a fact that has gained his embattled organization some support within respectable society.\n\nAs the crowd continues to grow wilder, the moment has now come to decide which of these four men will open the convention."

ustates.303.d:0 "The project ran into a significant problem when it was discovered that the nuclear material Plutonium has a fission rate too fast for a bullet. The solution came in the form of depleted Uranium initially planned for a different nuclear project. This makes the weapon barely ethical under normal nuclear waste usage guidelines, and creates the issue of intentional biological damage from radiation on the target. Nonetheless, the Thin Man is a success"

ustates.304.t:0 "The War and Peace Studies"
ustates.304.d:0 "In the past, our diplomatic conduct has been at the whim of ambassadors, many of whom had bought their positions from the party. The world we live in is too dangerous to afford such flippant choices to be made by agents of America, it is General MacArthur's opinion that a new approach to foreign policy is necessary, one that derives consensus from a group of trusted experts. This is what inspired the War and Peace Studies, a calling for only the brightest to represent America in this brave new world. This entity, the so-called the Council on Foreign Relations, will advise General MacArthur on how to suppress radical forces from any corner of the world."
ustates.304.a:0 "Constrained by diplomats no more."

ustates.305.t:0 "The White House and Xanadu"
ustates.305.d:0 "A surprising amount of support came from the pages of the many Hearst Newspapers that dot America. These papers drew up the image of MacArthur as the heroic Cincinnatus, hearing the call to save the Republic from certain destruction. A beacon for MacArthur's allies and the creation of an almost mythical personage through films and newspaper cartoons, Hearst has served as a stabilizing factor to the ship of the state. Even Hearst's attacks on radical unions and populists seemed to echo the words of MacArthur's radio speeches."
ustates.305.a:0 "We appreciate your support."

ustates.306.t:0 "The New Normal in America"
ustates.306.d:0 "When General MacArthur announced that he would not step down as leader those years ago, it was under the pretence of emergency. At the time. hundreds of thousands of Americas were unaccounted for, radicals prowled the countryside funding their politics with looted money, and the democratic pillar was unready to hold up the state. These past few years have seen a great many galvanize into hardy MacArthurites, and a new flavour of politician has emerged in the House of Representatives. These Congressmen see the need for an integral military role to check and nurture the business environment and ensure the rights of citizens cannot be infringed due to gridlock."

ustates.307.t:0 "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
ustates.307.d:0 "While the United States has an air force, the capability to defend the skies and project power, we do not have an Air Force. The role is split between the US Army in service of our Paratroopers, and the US Navy aboard our Aircraft Carriers. The contention the General Staff addresses today is the ultimate fate of the Air Force, and to which branch should tradition take after. Those in favour of the Army contend that future operations will most likely be in ground support or air drops, while Navy advocates claim that Aircraft are essential to the future of Naval Warfare in engagements large and small. We must choose a side."

ustates.308.t:0 "Super-weapons on a budget"
ustates.308.d:0 "In the last few years, our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own personal physics research. On our part, we don't know much about what Wilhelm Reich is talking about, but his reputation in Austria gives us some comfort into whatever science he's using."

The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights. Goddard's refusal to detonate explosive rockets on the Continental United States prevent the full scale of the damage to be known."

ustates.310.t:0 "Oppenheimer's Bomb a Success"
ustates.310.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Alamogordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favourite John Donne poem."
ustates.310.a:0 "The breath goes now."

ustates.311.t:0 "Reich's Failed Explosion"
ustates.311.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for its collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation. This embarrassment is currently making its rounds in the papers."
ustates.311.a:0 "Not our proudest moment."

ustates.312.t:0 "The Patriot Party?"
ustates.312.d:0 "With MacArthur holding onto power many allies such as Rockefeller, Kennan, Sutherland and the American Legion leadership is advising us to organize our supporters under a unified political party, rather than simply having known supporters of the military government. While it would take some getting used to, The Patriot Party would greatly aid in our efforts."

ustates.3120.t:0 "Courting Dissenting Generals"
ustates.3120.d:0 "Though most of our generals either agree with or have ignored our new junta system, but there are a few voices who have spoke up. Edwin F. Harding and Lloyd Fredendall, both of them men who were close to the traitor George Marshall, are the most prominent dissenters, and we should try to address their concerns. This could be done by a transfer of money or positions, or by giving them positions outside the Committee. What shall we do?"
ustates.3120.a:0 "Offer them bribes."
ustates.3120.b:0 "Grant them minor positions."

ustates.3121.t:0 "Bring King into the Committee?"
ustates.3121.d:0 "Ernest J. King is one of MacArthur's most loyal military officials, and his grip over the U.S. Navy should not be underestimated. Partly to reward his loyalty and partly to get the support of the navy, some of our advisors recommend that we allow King a spot in the Committee alongside the various generals that have seats. However, others argue for army purity within the Committee, and this could have benefits as well. Should we bring King into the fold?"
ustates.3121.a:0 "Give him a spot."

ustates.3122.t:0 "Republican Party Convention"
ustates.3122.d:0 "In the wake of MacArthur's near-dictatorship, Congress wants a candidate they can control in the White House. The best way they can see this being done is by choosing someone from among their own, who has considerable experience and will not rock the boat. An older, more malleable candidate would be preferred, if possible. For the Republicans, the party is looking to two men in particular. Bertrand Snell is fairly conservative for a Republican, and dislikes the policies of Hoover and Curtis, even though he agrees with their lissez-faire principles. John Taber has served as a New York representative for over ten years, and is fairly unexciting, which is exactly what congressional Republicans are looking for.

Carter Glass is an experienced senator from Virginia whose old age perhaps makes him unlikely for a two-term candidate, but a perfect one for a congressional restoration and return of security, especially given his conservatism. Sam Rayburn, who is a protege of former Democratic nominee John Nance Garner, has a long history in Congress, and has proven his loyalty to the party time and again.

Wherever they go, their supporters are likely to follow. However, it is a near certainty that they will demand concessions, specifically implementation of harsher inheritance taxes, limits on yearly income, and government preservation of surplus agricultural goods.

Though Long and many of his supporters were once Democrats, any love they had for the party is gone, and we believe they could be courted given the right conditions. There are also many who were once progressive Republicans, and seeing the party's return to such values, would be more than willing to rejoin. In any case, they will surely be wary of working with a major party, and will demand concessions before any agreement is made. This will likely take the shape of a watered-down "Share the Wealth" program.

Many of the AFP's leaders were once Democrats themselves, and these men will be easier to court than their Northern Republican counterparts.

However, we should reach out to their leadership as well, in the hopes of officially coming together as a political force. This will not be easy, and they are certain to demand concessions. Specifically, it seems they will ask for empowered unions, a universal income, and increased wages for workers. We have arranged a meeting in Chicago, where Robert Ferdinand Wagner will negotiate with William B. Green and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.

If we can solidify this constituency, we will have a certain advantage in the electoral college for years to come, given that the Red Belt states have high electoral college vote counts. Before we can be sure of their loyalty though, we should speak to some of their leaders. Preliminary attempts to negotiate have shown them to be tough negotiators, and we will likely have to choose between them and the few wealthy patrons we have left. Regardless, we have arranged for a meeting in Chicago, where the young but talented Harold Stassen will meet with Norman Thomas and James P. Cannon to discuss terms.

While the voters themselves supported us as the best progressive option last election, the leadership has been reluctant to support us. Surely they will want to guarantee that we are sincere in our promises of policy concessions, and they will demand quite a bit from us. What we decide to compromise on will be decided at the meeting, but we are confident that Illinois politician Adlai Stevenson has the necessary skills to bring them into the fold.

We will need to conduct serious outreach to voters and party leaders in the South who swore their loyalty to the Constitutional American Republic during the Civil War. It is a process that will take time, but we are confident it is a worthwhile investment. The ODP leaders will demand concessions however, including crackdowns on leftists and legislation to guarantee states rights to govern themselves.

To do so, we will need to negotiate with the ODP leaders, and their demands will be harsh. However, we are willing to do what we must to secure their support. They have asked for concessions varying from the elimination of corrupt party machines to national Jim Crow laws.

Not since the trial of President Lincoln’s assianation conspirators or the debacle of the Sacco-Vanzetti trial has the nation so fervently clamored for a verdict of justice to be decreed. However, today the defendant is no mere assassin or political radical, but instead the highly divisive former-General Douglas MacArthur. Once one of the leading figures and greatest heroes of the American Armed forces, MacArthur now stands humbled before the bench, stripped of all regalia and rank, at the mercy of the American people and the will of their perceived justice. This fallen titan stands accused of treason in his coup over the democratically elected government of the United States of America. As he awaits his likely arduous trial to begin, the nation waits on bated breath for the new Trial of the Century to begin. The American people are massively divided on this issue, as if division is what the nation needs now, with effectively half the nation seeing Macarthur as a hero and savior of democracy and Americanism, while the other side views him as a power hungry villain hellbent on absolute control over these United States. What the outcome for this grand trial shall be is unknown for the time being, but one thing all can agree on is that it is sure to be one long and painful trial; a pain necessary for America to feel before it can truly heal."

From Miami to Seattle, from San Diego to Bangor, every inch of this nation is abuzz, and ever divided, over the trial and its possible outcomes. As the nation watches and waits, the Chief Justice prepared to finally decree its decision. Many important figures in the country, from former presidents to Admiral Leahy himself, have noted that they are watching the case -and the verdict- closely.

Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."
ustates.500.a:0 "We shall see"

ustates.501.t:0 "Long and Haywood Demand Changes"
ustates.501.d:0 "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Bill Haywood and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."

Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible.

General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas. Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the AFP and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."

This has caused considerably controversy in some corners, especially among ODP and SPA supporters. Others say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolils or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are ODP and SPA strongholds."

ustates.515.d:0 "It came as a surprise to the Canadian government, but the ambassador from [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded that the Canadian government immediately begin repaying the war debts incurred by the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has, to an extent, avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the debt... not all at once, at least. Though the old United Kingdom was on its way to repayment, there was a tacit agreement after the British Revolution that the debts wouldn't continue to be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."

ustates.516.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
ustates.516.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to the demand with a flat refusal. The debt, they say, was never meant to be repaid until the Home Islands were retaken - as most was incurred by the United Kingdom, a government which is now in exile. Even so, their refusal has done its job and fired up the isolationist elements of the American government. President Hoover's government has the support it needs, at the cost of relations with the Canadians."

They have approached us with an offer: economic assistance now, and an agreement to increase trade with the Entente, in exchange for the rest of the debt being delayed until the Home Isles are retaken... which was, aides point out, the original deal to begin with. It might be a way to restore goodwill with our southern neighbors, and even help them, though some are suggesting that there's no point in shoveling our limited funds into a bottomless pit. America is lost, they say, and we should look to our own first."

ustates.517.b:0 "They are on their own"

ustates.518.t:0 "Canada Agrees to Compromise"
ustates.518.d:0 "The Canadian government has reluctantly agreed to the compromise, giving us what repayment they can now and accepting the deferment until the Home Isles have been retaken. In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all. The main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the AFP and the SPA, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."
ustates.518.a:0 "We'll take what we can get"

ustates.519.t:0 "Canada Refuses the Compromise"
ustates.519.d:0 "The Canadian government has refused our offer of compromise, leading to economic sanctions applied by both sides.

Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, Long was able to stay ahead of the traitorous general and has escaped to New Orleans. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the executive chair. Civil war is imminent."

They wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Haywood, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"

It could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us.

According to American officials, the West considered MacArthur just as much a traitor as Huey Long and Bill Haywood, and just as responsible for the death and destruction that ensued. Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin.

ustates.538.d.1936: "America had a brief period of calm today with a mostly peaceful Independence Day celebration. Commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 by the Second Continental Congress on the eve of the American Revolutionary war, the holiday is one of great importance to the American people. While many were worried that the rising tensions in America would result in yet another bout of violence in the long and brutal election season, most sighed a breath of relief today as the news reported little brawling during the annual celebration. While all the major candidates made sure to be seen and photographed among the large crowds and delivered speeches connecting their respective causes to the situation in 1776, most Americans took the time to take a break from the intense politics plaguing America. Instead they decided to just spend time with their families and friends amidst picnics and fireworks. It would seem for a brief moment, that America had finally received something it had lacked for a very long time... unity."

However, the 30 day deadline came and went, and America has found itself at war. President [Root.GetLeader] took to the air waves today in a widely-listened to broadcast in which he extolled American virtues and sacrifices while at war. He noted that July 4th was a day the disparate 13 colonies came together as one, and to found the great nation that Americans are now fighting for. To build a nation founded on democracy, prosperity, and unity. That despite their many differences, the founders were willing to put that aside and work peacefully to not only defend against British oppression, but also build a project to last generations. The radicals, he says, have sought to topple that peace and unity, to curtail democratic expression and replace voting with violence when they didn't get their way. So, one more time, Americans must come together and fend off those who would destroy the American way of life."

Seeking to emulate General Washington's July 9th reading of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Army gathered in New York City and rally the American people once again, President MacArthur has decided to deliver a speech before Federalist troops today. Noting that Washington had delivered his address even with British troops in the harbour, MacArthur reaffirmed that the United States military had always fought for American liberty and would continue to do so into the 20th century. Likening Congress's grant of emergency powers to him to Washington's commission as Commander-in-Chief, MacArthur concluded his speech by promising the American people to restore order to the Union."

While President Haywood had hoped to make his address near Independence Hall in Philadelphia, his staff dissuaded him from the plan. Instead, Haywood has elected to speak before assembled leaders at a local union chapter. Despite the relatively humble setting, the crowd watched with rapt attention. He noted that back in the day Americans had found themselves chafing under greed and neglect, and on this day they had formally organised for freedom from their chains. Noting that the first declaration had 27 points of grievances against the British, to roaring applause Haywood pulled out a list of 27 grievances the modern worker had and declared that the CSA would continue to fight on for a new America!"

While minutemen standing behind him scanned the rally for any would-be assassins, the crowd remained enthralled by the power of Long's voice. Long pointed out that in 1776, Americans were ruled by corrupt British oligarchs backed by the ruthless bayonets of the Redcoats. Despite the long odds however, American patriots rose up and drove out not only the British but their treacherous loyalists. Today he says, is no different. Americans must remain vigilant against the avaricious elite and their collaborators, and the modern minutemen stand ready to save America once again! Just as he finished, the fireworks show began behind him, much to the crowd's delight."

He emphasised that it was a democratically elected legislature, not a general or political strongman, who authorised the declaration of freedom. Today, he says, America finds itself once again at war against tyranny, fighting against forces willing to extinguish the flames of liberty.

However, the atmosphere has remained tense and war looms on the horizon. While many detractors have pointed out the irony in celebrating the Fourth of July in the midst of a Canadian occupation, the provisional government in New England had sought to combat the perception of being a Canadian puppet by putting on a memorable Fourth of July celebration. Speaking before Bunker Hill monument, President [Root.GetLeader] delivered his address by recalling the sacrifices Americans made in order to protect the liberty and prosperity of the nation, bravely waiting until they could see the whites in their enemies eyes before firing their limited ammunition.

President Murray has neglected to make any official celebration of the 4th of July, only delivering a short speech promising to free the American people from the tyranny of foreign hordes; just as America's forefathers were freed from the oppression of the British. After Murray's short remarks, Vice-President Rankin announced his well wishes to the nation in its hour of need. While Murray's official celebration was nothing impressive, unofficially, many Klan leaders have seized the opportunity to hold large celebrations across the south, fit with southern barbecue, fishing, beers and cross-burnings. Henry Ford has also held large celebrations of America's independence day, hosting Charles Lindberg and letting factory workers off early (which has become rare occurrence); even proving them with a free refreshments. However, Ford's celebration did not come with any fireworks; as fireworks contain precious gunpowder needed for the eventual war effort."

Omar Bradley has gone to great lengths to provide the troops of the Western Command center with a suitable Fourth of July party, even going so far as to raid cattle farms near Denver to provide the soldiers with a hearty meal. This all in an effort to provide the troops with one last night of good old-fashioned American unity and celebration. As devastation looms on the other end of the Rockies, Bradley can only brace for the long war that is bound to follow. As the sun sets on July 4th, the brave men of the Western Command Center shift from celebration to preparing for the inevitable, as no amount of beer, fireworks or barbecue will stop this war now; and many doubt that the Western Command Center can hold out against the titans crashing down around us."

Wearing his old Army uniform, the former Chief of Staff of the United States Army reflected upon the course of the war, his coming fate, and informed the audience that he would not resist arrest. Instead he said that he would accept imprisonment if it would bring the nation back together again without further bloodshed. He stated that he only did what he did in order to protect America, and was grateful for his many years in service as a \"fulfilment of his boyish hopes and dreams\".\n\nThough many in the audience clapped, critics have almost immediately lashed out, noting that MacArthur's coup helped trigger the civil war in the first place. Moreover, his speech seems to not only be a last ditch effort to gain pity (and possibly a pardon), but also appears to try taking credit for the reunification between the Pacific government and the Washington government, a success they argue is a credit to [Root.GetLeader] and diplomacy, not MacArthur. However, the public will probably remember MacArthur's iconic phrase he said in his speech's closing, before he turned himself into the custody of the waiting FBI..."

ustates.600.t:0 "Status of the US Army"
ustates.600.d:0 "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with no tanks at all and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."

ustates.601.t:0 "Status of the US Navy"
ustates.601.d:0 "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defense establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. New carriers have been commissioned, but they are nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm on the horizon."

ustates.603.d:0 "The Air Force has remained as a mostly tokenistic part of the Army, with barely any investment going towards it during the 1920s and 1930s. However, air development during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, spark conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganize as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield. With the High Command being undecided on the issue, the final decision has been sent to the War Department, where it has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense to decide on the matter."

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."

While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

One of the main points of contention is that, with the budget already pretty split between the Army and the Navy, the Army Air Force will now more than ever be a money sink that would be badly needed for the ground troops.

While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation. While the relations between MacArthur and navy have been bad for years, this is yet another sad example of how the inter-service rivalry has done nothing but grow in the last few years."

The manual consists of seven chapters – the first titled “General” followed by six chapters describing employment of antitank units in various scenarios (during the advance, halts, the development of the battle, defensive maneuvers, retrograde movements, and offensive operations). The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterized by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilized front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armored attacks. While officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."

ustates.613.t:0 "Chaffee Organizes the Combat Commands"
ustates.613.d:0 "The concept Chaffee first envisaged during his development mechanized tactics in the early 1930s was one where combined arms mechanized units would possess no formal structure. In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the 'Armored Force Tentative Table of Organization' where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organization that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armored division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defense, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organization system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."

ustates.614.t:0 "Release of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet"
ustates.614.d:0 "One of the major lessons from the civil war was the need to enhance the speed and clarity of our communications on the front line while not making our movements and organization system obvious to the enemy. In order to create a consistent naming system, the Army and Navy had designated a comission from the Signal Corps to work on a new radio alphabet system for our men to use, and we finally have the results from their efforts. With the publishing and distribution of the 'Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet' manual, our new alphabet shall utilize the codenames Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle, Victor, William, X-ray, Yoke and Zebra. While similar radio systems have been developed for the Canadians and the Germans, the fact we have finally taken the task of standarizing it means we're finally catching up with the lessons we missed in the Weltkrieg"

ustates.615.t:0 "Adoption of the M1 helmet"
ustates.615.d:0 "Ever since the Weltkrieg proved that helmets were vital to protect the infantry from flying fragments of exploded ordnance, the American Army has utilized the British Mk I helmet designed by John L. Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favorable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."

ustates.616.d:0 "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognized an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books. The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organizations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organizations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval. While our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."

ustates.617.d:0 "While the Victory Book Campaign has managed to pave the way for institutions like the Council on Books in Wartime and the War Book Panel, the Campaign itself is beginning to draw a lot of criticism from the Army. The Campaign was unfortunately not well suited for combat units, as the bulky hardcovers were found to be unsuitable for use in the field and many of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books. While the idea is still in the air, the Army has decided to order the VBC to come to a close, but has begun plans with the CBW to create a new plan to entertain our soldiers."

With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command. While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with 'Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'' should be discarded. Regardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."

While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe. However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests have proved not only that they were wrong, but we have paid the price dearly for it, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canadian put their snipers through in the weltkrieg."

As such, and with permission of both the War Department and the President, the Office of War Information has been created to work as a connection between the battlefront and civilian communities.

While this could yield great effects hindering our enemy's industrial capabilities, the ethical implications of utilizing such inhumane weapons of destruction has made many members of the staff restless on the subject, as these bombs might easily end up hitting civilians unintentionally.

ustates.627.d:0 "With the shortcomings of the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, the search for a more fitting permanent office space for the War Department has been ongoing for months already. First the military turned to the head of the Army’s Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell. He, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, which would house all the War Department's components. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cementery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropiate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accomodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

They note that better conditions can still be negotiated for through Congress. Meanwhile, in the South, the NDWL is decimated, if not outright pacified, and it is likely time to pull out our forces from the region.

To achieve this, he has sent an invitation to Bill Haywood to sit down in Chicago and negotiate a deal. Haywood holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, whom make up the bulk of the general strikers.

Midway through the negotiations, word arrived that both Huey Long and (upon hearing of Long's request) William H. Murray have demanded to be present at the negotiations, despite our diplomats already telling them they would be seen after Haywood. Their presence will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing could incite the AFP and ODP to such a degree as to make success in Chicago worthless.

However, the Home Rule plan aims to allow each to implment their ideas in their respective regions. Haywood demands that we make a show of goodwill by ending all attempts to end the general strike, essentially pulling our forces out of the region. The AFP and ODP have stated that if we are to follow through on such an effort, we will have to do the same for them, and order MacArthur's military forces to stand down. Of course, Haywood nearly blew up the negotations by stating that pulling forces away from ODP strongholds would simply make it easier for the Red Guard to eventually overrun them, but is was a threat Murray simply chuckled at and invited him to try his best. After Long and the President reminded both men that the US Army remained the issue at hand, they thankfully stopped their fighting for the moment."

They must also cease their current strikes, riots, party recruitment in other areas of the country, and most of all, any overtly aggressive action against us. The Socialists are now currently transitioning Chicago and Detroit to semi-syndicalist systems where workers are universally unionized and own shares of production. While many within the cabinet do not like giving them control even to this degree, this level of decentralization has defused the radicals while allowing us to focus on the West and East, regions where the federal government is still most influential. Further, it has given us a chance to eliminate their threat on a national level while giving each major constituency what they want."

The members of the Socialist Party and radicals of the AFP, meanwhile, called the Bill too moderate. As such, it failed to pass through Congress in 1935. However with the shift in American politics, Senator Wagner has seen another chance to attempt ot pass this act, and along with this bill, he has brought forward what he is calling the House Act. This would allow subsidies to be paid from the US government to local public housing agencies to improve living conditions for the impoverished of this great nation.

Meanwhile, the liberals of the Republican and Democrat Party are advocating a similar stance to the progressives, but to a far lesser degree, along with attempting to maintain the balanced budget. Establishment Republicans like Charles Curtis are advising Hoover to embrace their idea of a 'Work Sharing Plan', which would compensate Americans for their hours lost via partial unemployment subsidy, and the last option on Hoover's Desk is performing austerity measures that the conservative Democrats and Republicans have pushed for.

Next there is Samuel Green, representing the interests of the Ku Klux Klan and traditional nativist movements. Finally, there is Lothrop Stoddard, representing the new Scientific Racialist current that has been embraced by the elites of the East Coast. Each of these men has accrued considerable support for their agenda, and it looks like they and their supporters will all hold firm in maintaining the current deadlock if no outside force intervenes. \n\nFor this reason, the initiative is now on the [USA.GETLeader] administration to intervene by favoring one of the camps, giving their proposal the support needed to become official policy.

Blaming us for his death, and even claiming that some in our cabinet had a direct hand in organizing the killing, her vitriol has been both incessant and intense. While her and her late husband’s Red tendencies engender a health suspicion of her claims in most Americans, a growing number of especially naïve individuals have fallen for Bryant’s falsehoods. \n\nGiven that she shows no signs of stopping, there are many in the government who suggest we should step in to end her campaign.

However, when dealing with the leftist black agitators, the Americans instead chose to dump them on our shores, citing their Pan-Africanist ideology. Naturally, the insinuation that they have anything to with the Amero-Liberian people or our nation has proven deeply offensive to us all. One member of the TWP best summarized our sentiment by attacking the notion that \"a nation founded by the adopted sons and daughters of the old American elite should become the custodians of every criminal Negro in the Americas.\". \n\nNevertheless, we must be conscious of our situation, and act accordingly. The fate of our nation will always depend on a good relation with the Americans, whether we like it or not. Consequently, it may be better to let the slight pass for the sake of good relations, and use this surge of support for repatriationism to good ends.

An apology will not mean taking back those already sent to Liberia, where the state has pledged to deal with them. \n\nThis consideration is doubly useful, as the incident has now made it into the press, and become a political issue. Some of our more zealous supporters are outraged by this perceived insult and demand a flat rejection of the Liberian demands.

While the exact nature of his service for the Liberian government is unclear, they have been quick to affirm their general support for the scheme. And with a broad base of support for the plan in America, it seems repatriation has never been more likely. \n\nNevertheless, we have encountered firm opposition from traditional Dixiecrats and other so-called moderate Segregationists. Citing the important role of Blacks in the Southern economy, and determined to preserve the present social order, they have proved a source of stiff opposition.

As a result, a less ambitious and more \"practical\" alternative has been proposed. This would involve the repatriation of only a number of UNIA volunteers, to test the waters for broader repatriation down the line. \n\nSenator Bilbo has actively spoken against the plan, proclaiming it \"a half measure at best, and a scheme to delay full repatriation at worst.\" As tensions rise, a clear split has formed, with roughly even support for the two plans, and its anyone's guess which will be implemented."

It was revealed to us via photographic evidence that the Director himself secretly engages in the most debauched and degenerate homophile behavior and has done so for some years. Recognizing the use of this information, we were able to obtain Hoover's resignation in return for handing over the compromising photos.

Never has this been more true than now, as the justices have now made common cause with the rump opposition to delay, damage and dismantle our policy in any way possible. \n\nWith all other options and appeals exhausted, we will now have to take radical measures. If they want to play dirty, we'll be more than their match in that field. Two proposals have been made to this end.

However, the evolution of our nation and advances, both in urbanization and technology have made the college not only archaic, but actively counterproductive. Small states with smaller populations wield disproportionate electoral power, while the urban masses' votes are discounted in worth. In addition, the lack of punishment for faithless electors means that even when comparatively disenfranchised voters succeed in making their voice heard, their electors can ignore their wishes and accord their votes to another candidate, without fear of censure. \n\nAs a result, it has become abundantly clear that Electoral College reform is sorely needed. The only question left is whether we should take a moderate or more aggressive approach. The first would involve penalizing faithless electors nation-wide, with punishments up to and including imprisonment, while still retaining the college as a concession to smaller states. The second would involve the outright abolition of the college, even if angers those in the rural states, for the general furtherance of democracy in the nation. What is our decision?"

One skeleton was a largely complete and in-tact fossilized skeleton with only the front of the skull, parts of the pelvis, and some vertebrae missing, while the other two were far more eroded and fragmentary. Taken to the University of California Museum of Paleontology for study, the specimen has been tentatively named ‘Dilophosaurus wetherilli’ and is described as a medium sized predatory theropod hailing from the Early Jurassic period, with an estimated size of around 23 feet long and adorned with a distinct two-pointed crest atop its head. Some have even speculated it may have had a large frill and even was venomous, but these ideas have been largely decried.

Temporarily retiring from his acting career, Jimmy Stewart has enlisted with the United States Army, seeking a position in the Army Air Corp given his personal flight experience. Not a stranger to flight, Stewart has been piloting small aircraft since he was a teen, and for further military experience, both his grandfather’s served the Union in the first Civil War while his father served in the Spanish-American War. \n\nSeeking to utilize him for his skill as well as his ability to be a great tool for propaganda and the war effort, the Federal Government has moved to offer Stewart an officership, citing his flight experience and high marks received at Princeton University. Though he may be a bit green, it is no secret America needs able men in command now more than ever before, and so Stewart as well as Army Command have agreed to the proposition.

From the usage of electrical impulses and shock therapy to the application of general anesthesia like ether or chloroform, there exists a variety of possible cures, though the effects and efficacy varies greatly on a case by case basis. One novel method of soothing the affliction that has garnered national attention is to have attractive and buxom nurses care for the afflicted men, soothing their needs and caring for them while using simple arousal tactics in an attempt to make the soldiers simply forget their trauma. Though the effectiveness of this particular treatment is hotly debated, it has certainly gotten many veterans at least more open to receiving treatment.

However, though these three titans of our armed forces rule side-by-side as one body, naturally one will rise to become dominant. As we prepare to enter this new age for the American people, a main face for the Triumvirate and its direction must be chosen internally. \n\nMacArthur, if chosen to continue holding his dominant position, is expected to continue his hardline stances and his deep dedication to American militarism and Conservatism, though will likely have to soften some of his rougher edges to align with the realities of post-war life. Rallying around less divisive and war-mongering ideas are Eisenhower and Bradley, who both share goals of limiting our militarist reality to an extent as we shift to care for the American people and heal the Union. \n\nBradley espouses a return to good ol’ fashioned Christian Americanism and moderate Conservatism, especially seen in his recent quote ‘We have men of science; too few men of God. We have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the Sermon on the Mount. Man is stumbling blindly through a spiritual darkness while toying with the precarious secrets of life and death. The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living.’ Sharing similar ideas of greatly limiting the military-industrial complex while expanding care for the masses, Eisenhower - or ‘Ike’ as he is affectionately known by his supporters - seeks a more secular and open return to American ideas of Liberal Conservatism still tied to the armed forces but without letting the military dominate America’s needs and desires. \n\nDespite who shall become the face of the Triumvirate, these three true American heroes and proud veterans shall guide the nation together as we finally begin to heal and move on from this chaotic and bloody era."

nimatron.3.d:0 "Today one of the Titans of the Industrial Workers of the World, William 'Big Bill' Haywood, long time leader of the Socialist Party of America and unifier of the American Left, passed away after tripping on his dog's leash while walking through Chicago's Lincoln Park. His death has shaken the nation's left to its core. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn spoke at the funeral saying 'History has a long-range perspective. It ultimately passes stern judgment on tyrants and vindicates those who fought, suffered, were imprisoned, and died for human freedom, against political oppression and economic slavery.'\n\nMany other leaders within various Union organizations also spoke at his funeral as well as leaders within the Socialist Party of America. The most noteworthy speech, though, was given by Jack Reed, who ended his speech with some of Haywood's quotes. He reminded the audience that 'If the workers are organized, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped. A strike is an incipient revolution. Many large revolutions have grown out of a small strike. Remember that you are fighting more than your own fight. You are fighting for the entire working class and you must stand together'.\n\nWith Haywood's sudden death, the Socialist Party and its many allies across the political spectrum have been taken aback, and the leadership of the SPA, CSA, IWW and ALF-CIO have called for a joint Congress, in hopes of finding a man to fill Haywood's incredibly large shoes. This Congress comes on the face of increasing calls of a turn to reform instead of revolution, due to the passing of the political crisis that marked the dawn of 1937."

nimatron.4.t:0 "Emergency Congress of the Socialist Party of America"
nimatron.4.d:0 "Today marks the end of the Emergency Party Congress called by the leadership of America's far-left following the death of their long time leader, William Haywood. The Congress itself was a simple enough affair, with delegates from across the nation, and even representatives from the both the Union of Britain and the Commune of France in attendance. As with most party congresses, the revelation of factional differences came all too early, although unlike most congresses, these factions were broadly split into two camps.\n\nThe first and largest of these factions, mostly belonging to the ranks of the AFL-CIO and the few progressives in attendance, called for a drastic change in policy. Instead of advocating and working directly for Revolution, these delegates fought for change to reformism, working within the system to reform capitalism. This faction agured the point by stating the obvious, the situation in America was much different then in 1936. By and large, the people, save for the most ardent revolutionaries, had calmed, and a sense of national brotherhood and normality had been restored. If the Party truly wished to see socialism, they must work with this new era, and drop the most overt calls for revolution. The second and smaller faction, made up of the CSA, Fosterites and the remnants of the CPUSA, rejected the call for reformism outright, naming those who supported it counter-revolutionaries. The faction simply called for the maintenance of the status quo, with some of the more radical members calling for a sudden uprising against the Old Order.\n\nAs the congress went on, it was clear that the reformists had it in the bag. Thus, the SPA's party program was officially changed, with all usage of revolutionary language being dropped in favor of a more reformist tone. As for the new chairman, John 'Jack' Reed was elected, seemingly as a compromise candidate. John Reed has long something of a pariah within the American Left. Be it his constant flip flopping between supporting Leninist communism or Communard-style Syndicalism, or his failed career as a journalist, it seems the only reason Reed was elected was due to his long time association with the revolutionary faction within the SPA's coalition. Regardless of the reason, the American Left has a new face, and a new program to boot."

nimatron.5.d:0 "Following a celebration party at her home following her husband's elevation to chairman of the Socialist Party of America, Louise Bryant, in a drunken spiel to a reporter she was with, claims to have been having an affair with at least ten of the most influential Syndicalist intellectuals of our time! In great detail, Bryant spoke of her trysts with Eugene O'Neil, Andrew Dasburg, William C. Bullitt Jr., Al Capone, Eugene V. Debs, Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman together, Norman Thomas, and, during the Russian Civil War, Lavrentiy Beria, Leon Trotsky, and even Georgy Zhukov. Attempts to reach out to these individuals have been met with silence thus far.\n\nCritics of Reed, from both within and without the Socialist Party, have used this as proof of the long rumored status of Reed as a cuckold. Those critics within the Socialist Party say this is proof of Reed's slide into bourgeois tendencies, while those on the right use it as evidence of the degeneracy that follows in the wake of Socialism. Either way, Reed's already weak public image has been completely shattered, even further reducing his and the Socialist Party's likely hood of ever winning any election again."

###############################################

USA_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
USA_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
USA_GEORGE_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps in case of 'internal instability'. Regardless, he is widely considered one of the best planners of the United States Army and is widely respected within the General Staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
USA_HENRY_H_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."

He continued gaining relevance in the army thanks to his great leadership skills and technical expertise, reaching the rank of Captain in 1914 and taking part both in the Veracruz Expedition and the Pancho Villa Expedition with the 4th Field Artillery Regiment. He reached the rank of Major in 1917 and continued to take part in overseeing boards, experimenting with different types of artillery pieces as the Army began to prepare for possible involvement in the Weltkrieg that never came.\nHe was later assigned to the Army's Hawaiian department where he helped test new methods in coastal defence as well as spearheading the review of War Plan Orange, in the case of a Japanese attack of Hawaii. However, his involvement in what came to be known as the 'McNair Board' ended up drawing controversy from the Air Service Branch of the Army, which would later result in McNair presenting testimony against Billy Mitchell during a 1925 trial.

Warren. However, he did poorly and was dismissed from the academy in just one semester. His mother managed to convince the Senator to appoint him again the next year, but he dropped out, and while the Senator tried to appoint him for a third time the following year, he was rejected by the academy itself. Instead, Fredendall attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and undeterred by his experience in West Point, he took the officer's qualifying exam in 1906, achieving the highest grade of all the applicants. On February 13, 1907, he was finally commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant.

He was then posted to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he began teaching the basics of German Squad tactics to the eager staff, being promoted to major for his work. He'd continue perfecting his abilities, assisting the Army War College and graduating in 1922, and then leaving once more Germany, where he tried to foster good relations between the two countries' general staffs, but failing due to the hostile political climate of Germany towards the US. Krueger would then be assigned to the War Plans Division of the War Department General Staff, being one of the main engineers of the War Plan Blue, a hypothetical plan in case of another civil within the US.

For his outstanding performance, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant for the corps of engineers. After serving in several garrison posts, Lee was promoted to first lieutenant in 1912 and became an instructor for the Ohio National Guard. He'd choose to be sent to the Mexican border in late 1912 due to concerns that the Mexican Revolution might spill into American Borders. He conducted a series of topographical surveys in the American Pacific possessions, specifically Guam and Luzon in the Philippines, for which he was promoted to Captain in 1916. He was promoted to Major in 1920 and became Assistant Chief of Staff of the new Chicago-based VI Corps Area. He was posted as the District Engineer of Vicksburg, Mississippi when the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 happened, with Lee directing relief work and evacuations of towns and districts. After the passing of the Flood Control Act of 1928, Lee supervised works on the Red River, Ouachita River and Yazoo River and personally directed the construction of a new HQ and of the Waterways Experiment Station. After that, Lee attended the Army War College from September 1931 to June 1932 and became Assistant Commandant of the Army Industrial College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1934. Since then he has been the District Engineer of the Washington District and with the recent promotions, Lee earned his rank of Brigadier General, where his engineering skills may become vital for the staff."

USA_SMEDLEY_BUTLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Smedley Darlington 'The Fighting Quaker' Butler lied about his age and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1898 to join the American force fighting the Spanish-American war. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant for his higher education and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo after basic training. He didn't manage to see combat, as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899. He was then transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh for trying to rescue a fellow marine and earning a brevet promotion to captain. Afterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana wars, first to Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and to Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya and the capture of Coyotepe Hill. He'd take part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914, earning his first Medal of Honor in combat and being promoted to major. He'd be transferred to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor for fighting the Caco rebellion.

In 1927 he was sent to China to take charge of the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Legation Cities, earning his promotion to Major General, returning to America in 1929, and then competing and winning the role of Commandant of the USMC in 1931. He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension of the Hoover administration despite Butler’s criticism of Hoover. He remains however as one of the most influential and decorated officers of the United States Marine Corps, and his influence should not be taken lightly."

He would serve in the Spanish American War commanding the 9th Cavalry Regiment where he even managed to achieve a major breakthrough against Ludovico Arejola, prompting a promotion to first lieutenant and a transfer to the 1st Cavalry Regiment. There he'd serve as Aide-de-Camp for Brigadier General J.M. Bell and J.M. Lee for the remainder of the campaign, fulfilling several staff roles in the rear. He'd be transferred back to the US in 1904, and would serve as a staff member of the Texas Headquarters, until being promoted to Captain in 1906. He'd continue to fill a variety of staff roles while at the same time attending the Army Staff College and the Army War College, of which he graduated in 1909 and 1911 respectively. He took part in Pershing's punitive expedition, providing logistical support to Pershing, and earning him the promotion to major. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organizing the Bureau of the Budget in 1921, after which he was promoted to Brigadier General for his remarkable performance. He'd become Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War and was put in charge of the Industrial Preparedness sector, which got him his promotion to Major General. In 1934 he had a major fall out with General MacArthur that still causes tensions between the two until now.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong anti-immigrant and anti-semitic views both publicly and privately."
USA_GEORGE_PATTON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 11, 1885, in San Gabriel, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton has vocally opposed his colleague constantly. While his friend Eisenhower tends to mediate between the two, Patton has been forced by the general staff to remain as a lieutenant colonel despite having all the traits and qualifications of a brigadier general.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong racist views in public."

His first tour of duty was with the 15th Cavalry as part of the Army of Cuban Pacification, where he proved to be an extremelly competent horseman (which shortly earned him the nickname 'The Army's Finest Horseman'). He was next assigned to the Mounted Services School at Fort Riley, Kansas between 1907 and 1911, where he commanded the mounted detachment serving the students and staff of the Army War College. He was then sent to France to attend the French Cavalry School at Saumur in 1913, as tensions began rising in Europe. In 1914 he returned to America to teach in Fort Riley for a short time, but was redeployed to the 7th Cavalry Regiment in the Philippines. He was reassigned in 1915 to the Staff and Faculty at West Point as the Senior Cavalry Instructor in the Tactical Department, where he remained until 1919, when he became an instructor at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. The next year, he achieved the rank of Major and was reassigned first to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and then to the 1st Cavalry Division in 1921. After attending the Army War College, he assumed command of a squadron of the 3rd Cavalry from 1925 to 1927, when he moved to the War Department's General Staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. In that post, he began working extensively on compiling the usage of Tanks in the Weltkrieg and developing America's first mechanized and armored tactics, despite having very few assets available to put his theory to the test. Chaffee left the General Staff in 1931 to serve as the Executive Officer of the newly formed 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Knox, which was planned to be reformed into a mechanized unit. Returning to Washington, D.C. and the War Department in 1934, Chaffee has served as the Chief of the Budget and Legislative Planning Branch and has reached the rank of Brigadier General in late 1935.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While held in very high regard by the Cavalry, the General Army staff disagrees with his unproven battle doctrines."

He later served in a series of very important senior staff positions until becoming Commandant of Army War College from 1930 to 1935, when he was promoted to Three Star General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He has expressed in High Command Meetings and the Congress that the Army is lacking of preparedness in manpower and material, stressing the essentiality of lead time in military preparedness and focused attention on army planning as keys to victory.\n- While he has agreed in the past with other Cavalry Officers that Mechanization may be inevitable, he has stressed that the US Army first needs a large standing army to protect its industry before the Army can dream on fielding Tanks on a large scale."
USA_FOX_CONNER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 2, 1874, in Slate Springs, Missippi, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of Confederate Soldier Robert Conner, Fox Conner joined West Point via congressional appointment in 1894 and graduated as Second Lieutenant in 1898, excelling in history, mathematics, horsemanship and French. Despite being a Cavalry enthusiast, he was assigned to the 1st Artillery Regiment, and he was denied several requests for transfer into the Cavalry branch. He was sent to Cuba in 1899, where he served with the occupation force following the Spanish-American War and met his future wife, Virginia Brandreth. He reached the rank of Captain in 1901, after which he was transferred to the 123rd Coast Artillery Company in Fort Hamilton, New York. He continued on his post until entering the Army Staff College in 1905 and the Army War College in 1907, from which he graduated in 1911. He was then sent abroad as a military attaché to the French 22nd Field Artillery Regiment. After returning to the US, he was assigned to the Artillery Batteries near the Mexican Border, where he was promoted to Major and assigned to the Inspector General's office in Washington D.C.. He remained in his post for the next few years, where his ability in French allowed him to translate many of the French reports on the battles of the Weltkrieg, earning him a promotion to Colonel in 1918 and later Brigadier General in 1920, and allowing him to meet the up-and-coming George C. Marshall in the War Department. He was then transferred to Fort Meade, where he was introduced to George S. Patton, quickly becoming friends and through which he was introduced to Eisenhower, both of which quickly became friends and seeming pupils of Conner. This would lead him to choose Eisenhower to follow him to Panama after being assigned to its garrison, and despite their disagreements on motorized divisions and the usage of tanks in modern war. He was promoted to Major General in 1925 and was proposed by Pershing for Chief of Staff in 1930, although he was ultimately passed on in favour of Douglas MacArthur. He has since then being assigned to the First Army, and he is known to maintain regular correspondence with Marshall, Patton and Eisenhower still.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Soon to retire from the Army."

USA_social_gospel_desc:0 "It is a simple fact of economics that wealth trickles down from the wealthiest to the less fortunate. We should ensure that our citizens are aware of this new social gospel."
USA_soften_regulations:0 "Soften Regulations"
USA_soften_regulations_desc:0 "The last thing we need in the aftermath of this Civil War is unnecessary, burdensome regulations on businesses. We should cut back red tape and ensure that companies are able to succeed in these trying times."
USA_labor_management:0 "Labor-Management Act"
USA_labor_management_desc:0 "Poor labor relations was a key spark behind the Civil War. We should ensure that unions and other syndicalist groups have their power stripped away, and that business owners truly have their employees’ interests in mind."
USA_fiscal_reform:0 "Fiscal Reform"
USA_fiscal_reform_desc:0 "We need a comprehensive reform of our finance and banking system. Cutting back red tape, unnecessary regulations, and other roadblocks to success are what this country needs after the Civil War."
USA_bureau_of_the_budget:0 "Bureau of the Budget"
USA_bureau_of_the_budget_desc:0 "A balanced budget is key in running any state. None of this 'deficit spending' nonsense. We should only spend what we make, and not a cent more."
USA_market_liberals_in_power:0 "Republicans Elected"
USA_market_liberals_in_power_desc:0 "The Republican Party, champions of free trade, deregulation, and the financial sector, have won the [GetYear] elections. Citizens can expect to see lower taxes, better prices, and a return of the can-do individualist spirit of American capitalism."
USA_settelment_movement:0 "Settlement Movement"
USA_settelment_movement_desc:0 "The Settlement Movement was popular in pre-Weltkrieg England and America, and focused on bringing the rich and poor together in 'settlement houses' to better understand each other. We should encourage a revival of this movement in these difficult social times."
USA_small_business_support:0 "Support Small Business"
USA_small_business_support_desc:0 "Small businesses were the backbone of the American economy, until many were destroyed in the Civil War. We should look into tax incentives and other strategies to restore small business confidence."
USA_business_grants:0 "Business Grants"
USA_business_grants_desc:0 "Larger business also suffered in the Civil War, and just like smaller businesses need government intervention to be fully restored to their pre-war profitability."
USA_hollywood_glamor:0 "Hollywood Support"
USA_hollywood_glamor_desc:0 "Many prominent Hollywood actors and producers support the Republican cause. We should enlist them in creating films that promote Republican values to the rest of the country."
USA_education_philanthropy:0 "Education Philanthropy"
USA_education_philanthropy_desc:0 "The richest businessmen usually attended a small set of elite universities, like the Ivy Leagues, Stanford, and the University of Chicago. We should create scholarships to ensure that those less fortunate can also attend these beacons of learning."
USA_new_liberalism:0 "New Liberal Era"
USA_new_liberalism_desc:0 "Since the Republican party was elected to power, American business and finance have risen to new heights. Unemployment is low, and stock prices continue to rise. God bless America and God bless capitalism!"
USA_protect_industry:0 "Protect Industry"
USA_protect_industry_desc:0 "While not opposed to all trade it has long been the position of the Republican Party to protect our infant industries from foreign competition while they already engage in domestic competition so that we may develop more quickly."
USA_incentivize_charity:0 "Incentivize Charity"
USA_incentivize_charity_desc:0 "Currently there is a large swath of the population that needs our aid but, as usual, direct government intervention would be inefficient compared to private intervention. Instead our public service campaign will urge the wealthy to donate, offering a tax break for anyone who does and honoring those whom give the most by honoring their deeds."
USA_local_budgeting:0 "Local Budgeting"
USA_local_budgeting_desc:0 "Decentralization of the economy makes up much of the backbone of our beliefs and so it should go with the national budget, with local governments being given greater flexibility to set budgets and being recognized by our political leaders for saving money where they can."
USA_naval_expansion:0 "Naval Expansion"
USA_naval_expansion_desc:0 "The Republican belief in isolationism saved countless American lives by helping avert intervention in the Weltkrieg. It shall continue with a defensive policy of naval buildup that keeps foreign empires out of American affairs and vice-versa."
USA_slash_spending:0 "Economy Act"
USA_slash_spending_desc:0 "This is no time to be spending money on high government salaries. The Economy Act will slash government salaries by nearly half a billion dollars thus pushing us closer to a balanced budget and with it investor confidence."
USA_give_me_your_poor:0 "Give Me Your Poor"
USA_give_me_your_poor_desc:0 "One of the founding traditions of America was that we took in the poor of the world and allowed them to flourish in our country. We must continue this tradition. Let us encourage poor, hardworking families from all over the world to immigrate to the United States, so that they may prosper under liberty and democracy."
USA_infastructure_investment:0 "Infrastructure Investment"
USA_infastructure_investment_desc:0 "One of the few reliable positives the government can provide for the economy is infrastructure, which helps faciliatate business around the nation. Let us continue these national projects in the style of Abraham Lincoln."
USA_good_neighbor_policy:0 "Good Neighbor Policy"
USA_good_neighbor_policy_desc:0 "For decades, the United States has used force to maintain order in Latin America. However, given our recent Civil War, it is more difficult than ever for us to do that. Instead, we should endeavor to increase our cooperation and trade with our Southern neighbors for the mutual benefit of all involved."
USA_reduce_subsidies:0 "Reduce Subsidies"
USA_reduce_subsidies_desc:0 "Subsidies are an example of government overreach. It is difficult to know how much is enough in a subsidy, or if it will benefit either party at all. More often than not, it is merely wasted money. We should reduce government subsidies as much as possible and let the invisible hand of the market guide our business world."
USA_education_campaign:0 "Education Campaign"
USA_education_campaign_desc:0 "Farm children are often kept out of school, with the excuse that they are needed as hands on the farm. This will no longer be the case. We will invest in rural schools as well as other methods of rural education so that every child in our country can receive the education they deserve."
USA_tolerance_campaign:0 "Tolerance Campaign"
USA_tolerance_campaign_desc:0 "What someone drinks or consumes in their time is not the business of the government. So long as it does not interfere with their work life, we should encourage tolerance of such practices. We make far too much income from such products to throw them away just for some of our more moralistic supporters."

### Social Liberals ###
USA_progressive_taxation:0 "Liberal Taxation"
USA_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "Ideally, taxation should strike a balance between allowing people to still have enough money to spend on consumer and luxury goods, and supporting government programs. The Progressive Party's tax plan ensures this will be the case."
USA_securities_act:0 "Securities Act"
USA_securities_act_desc:0 "Many are fearful of the large-scale confiscations of wealth carried out by the CSA and AUS during the Civil War. We need to enact legislation to reassure the people that their property is theirs and theirs alone."

USA_free_trade1:0 "Support Free Trade"
USA_free_trade1_desc:0 "Free trade is the building block of a strong economy. We should ensure that tariffs are struck down, and that barriers to free trade are lifted with our allies and neutral countries around the globe."
USA_social_liberals_in_power:0 "Liberal Republicans Elected"
USA_social_liberals_in_power_desc:0 "The Liberal Republicans have won the [GetYear] election! Their agenda is a continuation of the pre-Civil War progressive wing of the Republican party, prioritizing liberal free trade, progressive social policies, and a moderate welfare state."
USA_country_life_movement:0 "Country Life Movement"
USA_country_life_movement_desc:0 "The Country Life movement emphasizes a return to a rural lifestyle, and has grown popular among those disillusioned with city life following the turmoil of recent years. We should encourage it, as it helps improve the infrastructure and industry of neglected, rural areas."
USA_efficiency_movement:0 "Efficiency Movement"
USA_efficiency_movement_desc:0 "30 years ago in the height of the Progressive Era, the Efficiency Movement tried to eliminate superfluous waste from the household and the workplace. With the economy still recovering from the Civil War, we should try and bring the movement back into the public consciousness."
USA_chautauqua:0 "Chautauqua"
USA_chautauqua_desc:0 "The Chautauqua Institution is a prominent retreat in upstate New York that promotes progressive values. We should introduce its leading thinkers to the national stage, so they can better promote their theories."
USA_four_freedoms:0 "Four Freedoms"
USA_four_freedoms_desc:0 "Americans enjoy four key freedoms that most of the world lack. The freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want, and most importantly, the freedom from fear. With our Civil War now concluded, we must make sure all our citizens, no matter their skin color or religion, can enjoy these freedoms."
USA_liberal_unions:0 "Support Liberal Unions"
USA_liberal_unions_desc:0 "Not all unions are nests of syndicalism. Some actually stand for the betterment of the working class, rather than just advancing the selfish goals of their leaders. We should support these unions, both to protect our workers and undercut syndicalists still hiding in the country."
USA_mathematical_tables_project:0 "Mathematical Tables Project"
USA_mathematical_tables_project_desc:0 "There is a misconception that the unemployed masses of America are uneducated and lazy. We will prove that this is not true. To do this, we have found some of the most talented and intelligent individuals in the country who, despite their intellect, find themselves out of luck. These individuals will tabluate higher mathematical functions among other things."
USA_new_progressive_era:0 "New Progressive Era"
USA_new_progressive_era_desc:0 "Since our election, America has enjoyed a period of growth unheralded in its history. Rising from the ashes of the Civil War, we can now turn our gaze to spreading progressivism around the world."
USA_fair_labor_standards:0 "Fair Labor Standards"
USA_fair_labor_standards_desc:0 "The FLSA will go a long way to protect American workers. We plan to establish a minimum wage, give overtime pay, and implement harsher youth employment standards. These measures will go a long way in curbing corporate mistreatment of workers while also bolstering the economy."
USA_federal_one:0 "Federal One Project"
USA_federal_one_desc:0 "Industrial workers aren't the only people who have to eat. The government will employ thousands of artists, musicians, actors, writers, and other cultural figures. Noone shall be denied employment discriminately in these trying times, and the work these people do is just as important as the work of anyone else. Let us give our people dignity."
USA_agricultural_adjustment:"Agricultural Adjustment Act"
USA_agricultural_adjustment_desc:"There are many ideas for how to help our farmers in this crisis. One idea states that we should create the AAA, which will boost agricultural prices for farmers while reducing surpluses. The government will use this to ensure their farmers can stay afloat in these desperate times."
USA_banking_act:0 "Banking Act"
USA_banking_act_desc:0 "This act will resquire a certain amount of reserves and interest rates for deposits at member banks, as well as giving the Board of Governors contorl over some tools of monetary policy. The Board will also have authority over discount rates in each Federal Reserve district."

USA_freed_currency_desc:0 "This act will require all gold held by the Federal Reserve to be put into the hands of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. This will allow us to use monetary gold stuck for the good of the country and to protect our currency system from foreign practices."

### Social Democrats ###
USA_new_nationalism:0 "New Nationalism"
USA_new_nationalism_desc:0 "This New Nationalism regards the executive power as the steward of the public welfare. It demands of the judiciary that it shall be interested primarily in human welfare rather than in property, just as it demands that the representative body shall represent all the people rather than any one class or section of the people."
USA_labor_relations_act:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
USA_labor_relations_act_desc:0 "Poor relations between the owners and working classes was a major spark for the Civil War. We need to enact legislation that will ensure workers are protected from exploitation."
USA_social_security:0 "Social Security"
USA_social_security_desc:0 "A modern Social Security system will give the elderly the ability to retire in peace and financial security, and generate a great deal of popular support for our administration."
USA_social_democrats_in_power:0 "Progressives Elected"
USA_social_democrats_in_power_desc:0 "In an upset, the Progressive party has won the [GetYear] election! They have a sweeping agenda that emphasizes mending the divide between the working class and the wealthy, as well as building a welfare state."
USA_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
USA_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "Unemployment breeds radicalism. We must ensure that the young men demobilized from the war have meaningful employment, or we will see a rise in the radicalism we spent the last few years attempting to suppress."
USA_brain_trust:0 "Brain Trust"
USA_brain_trust_desc:0 "The group of young new progressive Senators elected in the Farmer-Labor ticket have been deemed the 'Brain Trust' due to their Ivy-League education and radical proposals for reforming the country."
USA_public_works:0 "Work for Welfare"
USA_public_works_desc:0 "Under the new Works Progress Administration public work projects will be available for those on relief or are unemployed which serves a two-fold purpose; they will help repair the damage wrought by the Civil War and they will provide valuable work opportunities for those whom need it most, especially veterans."
USA_new_anti_trust_laws:0 "New Anti-Trust Laws"
USA_new_anti_trust_laws_desc:0 "Corporate exploitation of the working class was a major reason for the rise of the CSA. We need to break up the largest banks and other industrial conglomerates to prevent this from occurring again."
USA_workers_compensation:0 "Worker's Compensation"
USA_workers_compensation_desc:0 "Workers must be protected from exploitation. Those who are injured in the workplace will be provided for by this new round of legislation, which allows wage replacement for such workers. Our disabled bretheren deserve dignity too."
USA_minium_wage:0 "Minimum Wage"
USA_minium_wage_desc:0 "We currently lack any sort of a federal minimum wage. Ensuring that all everyone is able to afford a minimum standard of living will not only ensure people are able to live securely, but it will help the national economy as a whole."
USA_resettlement_adminstration:0 "Resettlement Administration"
USA_resettlement_adminstration_desc:0 "Massive numbers of refugees fled all over the country during recent strife.

USA_bread_and_roses:0 "Bread Peace and Roses"
USA_bread_and_roses_desc:0 "America has prospered under the Farmer-Labor party. The economy is booming, and radical syndicalism and other leftist ideologies have been undercut by the government's welfare programs. It's a new day in America."
USA_removing_money_from_politics:0 "Fight Money in Politics"
USA_removing_money_from_politics_desc:0 "Money is a cancer that has infected our political system for decades. For too long, politicians have been at the whim of their donors in the oil and steel industries, while simultaneously ignoring their loyal supporters. This will no longer be the case. Legislation banning all forms of dark money in politics will be passed while the amount of legal money that should be allowed in donations is still being debated."
USA_national_electricity:0 "National Electricity"
USA_national_electricity_desc:0 "The American people need affordable electricity and they need it now. The government will take control of waterpower direclty through buyouts and purchase majority shares in US electricity companies to organize cheap electricity for the public good to power America's railroads, streets and homes."
USA_power_of_the_ballot:0 "Power of the Ballot"
USA_power_of_the_ballot_desc:0 "We can no longer allow for the American people to be left out of decisions concerning a government that affects them all. National initiatives and referendums should be expanded as a means to settle public debates as opposed to relying exclusively on bureaucrats and the ability to recall public officials seen as a moral right."
USA_wealth_taxation:0 "Wealth Taxation"
USA_wealth_taxation_desc:0 "We cannot allow America to become a new aristocracy that eliminates divine right of monarchy but replaces it with wealth. Our new inheritance and land taxes will ensure that the wealthy do their patriotic duty and pay the appropriate amount of taxes to fund goods for the American people, especially its farmers and workers."
USA_new_public_works:0 "Public Works"
USA_new_public_works_desc:0 "We need to knock out two for the price of one and combat both the unemployment and under-development that poses a national security risk. The Public Works Administration will hire a large swath of people to build massive public projects such as dams, bridges, and highways. It may be expensive, but the hope it offers America is priceless."
USA_encourage_temperance:0 "Encourage Temperance"
USA_encourage_temperance_desc:0 "Overconsumption of liquor is little more than a gateway to poverty, madness, and sloth, and it remains one of the great social ills of our times. While the anti-Saloon League failed to nationally prohobit it, we can expand funding for dry county enforcement, build temperance fountains and scare the public straight with a campaign against liquor."
USA_citizen_education:0 "Citizen Education"
USA_citizen_education_desc:0 "All across the nation, Native American citizens are not receiving a proper, hands on education. Our Education system should implement some of John Dewey's reforms alongside a nationalistic program that promotes American values and loyalty."
USA_national_railroads:0 "National Railroads"
USA_national_railroads_desc:0 "Our country is sadly lacking in providing a public means of national production while the Railroad Brotherhood desires greater protection from their bosses. The solution to this comes naturally via the nationalisation of railroads, purchased with money raised by bonds via the genius of Glenn E. Plumb."
USA_credit_unions:0 "Support Credit Unions"
USA_credit_unions_desc:0 "It is time to shake off the influence banks have over the lives of workers, farmers and the free-laborer. Credit unions will be issued cheap federal loans to get their start and tax breaks so that the independent contractors may be more self-reliant and the bankers held accountable."
USA_national_health_insurance:0 "National Health Insurance"
USA_national_health_insurance_desc:0 "When our citizens fall ill they are expected to pay for the right to live. This is immoral but worse, it drives the people in the arms of the faux-caring Marxists. A public healthcare option will provide universal health care, funded by an increase in the income tax, so that all may enjoy their natural right to life."
USA_fair_house_trade:0 "Fair House Standard Trade"
USA_fair_house_trade_desc:0 "While trade has its place, especially for our farmers whom must export their goods, our workers can not be expected to compete with every nation on earth. It also undermines our cause to accept cheap goods from nations that do not accept similar working conditions. Goods that will lower the wages of our workers will pay a higher tariff."
USA_protect_strikers:0 "Protect Strikers"
USA_protect_strikers_desc:0 "Strikers are little more than workers asserting their rights in the face of abysmal working conditions and yet governors, bosses, and judges believe they have the right to make Marxists look vindicated by cracking down on these patriotic Americans. Striking will be recognized as a national right and the army will protect those whom are attacked by industrial goons."
USA_quota_act:0 "Quota Act"
USA_quota_act_desc:0 "With all the pressure already laid on American culture and worker wages that last thing we need is large amounts of untrained, cheap laborers pouring over the border. The quota system will put a limit on the number of low-wage immigrants that can come into the nation annually."
USA_food_stamps:0 "Food Stamps"
USA_food_stamps_desc:0 "Henry Wallace had a revelation when he saw surpluses of agricultural goods on one hill and starving citizens on another. If the market won't achieve equilibrium on its own, we will give it the encouragement it needs with a food stamp program that will make it easier for poor citizens to afford farm goods."
USA_farm_credit_act:0 "Farm Bankruptcy Act"
USA_farm_credit_act_desc:0 "The madness of allowing our farms to close, especially in a time of depression, is utterly intolerable! A co-operative Farm Credit System will be created to provide farmers cheap loans and to prevent the avoidable foreclosure of the nations providers, for their welfare and our own."
USA_support_long:0 "Rescue the Kingfish"
USA_support_long_desc:0 "Is Huey Long a man without issue? Of course not; he runs a political machine and has a head the size of Mount Rushmore. However, he is an ally of the progressives in his region and his territory is a stalwart against the authoritarians while his economic policies promise to help break radicalism. We shall do for him what he is attempting to do for America and save him from the loons and cowards whom surround him."

### National People's Party ###
USA_return_to_true_americanism:0 "A Return to True Americanism"
USA_return_to_true_americanism_desc:0 "The National People’s Party have won the 1940 election! Their agenda is a hybrid of Dixiecrat, Fordist and Nativist ideology, reflecting the big-tent nature of the party. They call for a return to small government, the dismantlement of the welfare state built by Norris and the formulation of a national policy to \"maintain America’s White Anglo-Saxon Protestant character\" at all costs."
USA_end_federal_largesse:0 "End Federal Largesse"
USA_end_federal_largesse_desc:0 "While the Progressives may claim that the system they created will lead a \"just and square America for all to enjoy\", we know better. What they have created is nothing more than a system of near Gracchian largesse, which will do nothing other than to make all Americans the clients of the Progressives and their friends in Washington. To ensure that all citizens continue to remain free men rather than slaves, we must therefore dismantle the so-called \"Fair Deal\" established by Norris. To wean the people off the poisoned chalice they have been offered will be difficult, but its rewards will be all the sweeter in the end."
USA_corporatism_not_councilism:0 "Corporatism Not Councilism"
USA_corporatism_not_councilism_desc:0 "Having dispensed with the inefficient and immoral dole instituted by Norris, we must now return to the traditions of hard work and free enterprise that made America great in the first place. With this in mind, we will begin by removing the unnecessary regulations and oversights imposed on the market, which threatened to strangle business in its entirety. In America, business fulfill its social function through the positive relationship of the capitalist and his worker, not through the demands of the bureaucrat and the union boss. \n\nWe will remind all of this fact by putting the emphasis on Fordism rather than Crypto-Syndicalist political oversight as the recipe for our social model, and let the private sector stand free once again."
USA_unchain_capitalism:0 "Unchain Capitalism"
USA_unchain_capitalism_desc:0 "While we have made great strides in combating the sprawling red-tape laid by the Progressives and restoring the spirit of free enterprise to America, there is still more that can be done. We will build on our unique social model by enshrining the role of the corporation as the locomotive which drives America towards an ever brighter future. And this great machine will now have the chains holding it in place broken."
USA_restore_agrarian_autonomy:0 "Restore Agrarian Autonomy"
USA_restore_agrarian_autonomy_desc:0 "The promises made by the Progressives to farmers across America were some of their most pernicious lies. They claimed that they would bring about a new era of stability and prosperity, bringing about Jefferson’s agrarian idyll. In actuality, the government programs targeting farmers have made them less independent and more beholden to the rich and powerful than ever. \n\nTheir dependence on government assistance to escape the horrors of the depression have tied to aid programs which are now held above their heads to justify lowering prices, growing certain varieties of crops and more. It is our imperative duty to break apart these arrangements and return power and control to the farmers, lest farming become the sole prerogative of the state. They may complain now, but they will thank us later."
USA_enshrine_states_rights:0 "Enshrine States' Rights"
USA_enshrine_states_rights_desc:0 "Given their long history as enemies of states’ rights and advocates for further increases to federal power, it should be no surprise that the Progressives continued this policy during the last four years. The Norris presidency marked the apogee of this tendency, as federal power was used as a battering ram ahead of the implementation of their un-American agenda. Now that we have taken power, we will pursue a policy of restoring autonomy to the states, and re-assuring regions like the South of our commitment to letting them once again govern themselves."
USA_whittle_down_washington:0 "Whittle Down Washington"
USA_whittle_down_washington_desc:0 "While we have now rolled back the bureaucratic despotism of the Progressive Party and re-asserted America’s traditions small government, capitalism and an independent spirit, this is not enough. We must ensure that we will enshrine these values within the law, to ensure that they will never be challenged again. Only then can the overreach of federal power be forever checked and our traditions preserved."
USA_defend_fair_columbia:0 "Defend Fair Columbia"
USA_defend_fair_columbia_desc:0 "Like our predecessor, Rome, our city on the hill is all too often threatened by the incursions of barbarian and alien elements who threaten the safety of the republic. To prevent America from being overrun, we will redouble the patriotic effort to ensure that the native population of this land and their heritage will remain sacrosanct. Liberty cannot and will not be allowed to be drowned underneath the growing tide of foreign influence that now seems to beat upon it."
USA_enforce_asiatic_exclusion:0 "Enforce Asiatic Exclusion"
USA_enforce_asiatic_exclusion_desc:0 "It is well understand throughout America that the integration of Asiatic nationals is and will remain impossible. Consequently, our policy has been to ensure that this issue does not occur to begin with, by enforcing a policy of Asian Exclusion, to prevent our shores from being overrun. Nevertheless, there are still places where this policy is insufficient, most prominently in the loopholes used by the Filipinos and Japanese to continue to enter this country. \n\nResolving the first shall be easy, if unpopular with their government, but the second requires more thought..."
USA_expel_foreign_anarchists:0 "Expel Foreign Anarchists"
USA_expel_foreign_anarchists_desc:0 "For many years, the underbelly of Europe has vomited onto the East Coast some of the vilest, filthiest and most diseased wretches known to man. Bomb-chuckers, rail wreckers and arsonists, all declaring loyalty to Anarchist and Socialist causes have done immeasurable damage to our nation. No amount of raids, prison sentences and executions can dissuade them, with some even being emboldened by the action taken against them. The only course of action left to us, is to compile records of all these dangerous subversives in our nation, together with any accomplices and associates, and expel them from our nation without delay. \n\nIf they love Socialism, let them find it in their own homelands and not here."
USA_promulgate_national_racial_laws:0 "Promulgate National Racial Laws"
USA_promulgate_national_racial_laws_desc:0 "The American people were amongst the first in the world to understand the importance of enshrining the natural racial order in law. Our laws and traditions have ensured the stability of the nation and the best development of all in it according to their traits and capabilities. Nevertheless, in this age of upheaval and radical agitation, the extant legislation is increasingly unable to respond to the needs of the day and serve the national interest. \n\nTo address this issue, we will organize the \"National Conference on Racial Order and Hygiene\", to formulate a more modern approach to racial policy, which will hopefully serve us long into the future."
USA_drive_out_seditious_elements:0 "Drive Out Seditious Elements"
USA_drive_out_seditious_elements_desc:0 "Within America, there are a number of political agitators of foreign extraction who have proven themselves increasingly troublesome. While we had hoped that our recent initiatives in reinforcing the social order would dissuade them, this has not been the case. If anything, they now roundly attack our defense of the natural order and agitate minorities within our nation in support of foreign powers. This troublesome behavior can clearly only be met with a more permanent solution. \n\nConsequently, we will begin to send these agitators and their followers to the shores of those states to whom they profess loyalty. If they wish to co-habit with the enemy, then we will help them be on their way."
USA_break_syndicalist_agitation:0 "Break Syndicalist Agitation"
USA_break_syndicalist_agitation_desc:0 "Having defended America from a myriad of threats, without and within, we now find ourselves facing the great danger of all, the Syndicalist agitator. While our actions may have severed its colored and foreign appendages, Syndicalist tendencies have unfortunately dug themselves into the minds of the American workingman like a tick. We will undertake a campaign to remove these dangerous ideologies from the minds of the general public, and cauterize the wounds they have left by reaffirming traditional American values in their place."
USA_liberty_not_legalism:0 "Liberty Not Legalism"
USA_liberty_not_legalism_desc:0 "America is not called \"the land of the free\" without reason. In this country, our traditions have always favored liberty, personal agency and the ability of the individual to act without being encumbered by excessive restrictions and red-tape. Under this policy, our nation flourished, and citizens were able to experience the boundless potential and prosperity of the American dream. \n\nWhile the job of rolling back the Progressive excesses which endangered this dream is now complete, our work is not yet done. We must now expand on this promise by codifying legislation that allows for our Capitalist model to work to its fullest, to bring about the fruits of the American Gospel more than ever."
USA_privatized_progress:0 "Privatized Progress"
USA_privatized_progress_desc:0 "Not all infrastructural development needs to be undertaken by the government. Private enterprise can frequently fulfill the same role at a lower price and with better quality to boot. Why then should we waste tax-payer money on boondoggles and roads to nowhere when private citizens will fulfill genuine needs as and when they appear, and with better results."
USA_localized_development:0 "Localized Development"
USA_localized_development_desc:0 "For too long, infrastructural development in this country has been focused on nation-wide projects of massive scope and cost. While schemes of this sort are essential to uniting a country as large as our own, they can also lead to us missing the forest for the trees. We must also take care that we maintain and build up the local roads, bridges and all manner of other infrastructure that the majority of Americans depend on. The role of the government should be to build what the little man can’t, rather than building to lofty heights most will never need to reach."

USA_power_to_the_pinkertons_desc:0 "The name \"Pinkerton\" has long been one feared by outlaws and agitators alike. Whether it be on the vast expanse of the Old West, among the slums of New York or in the factories of Chicago, the Pinkerton Agency has long been a force for order and a hammer against criminality. Even the Department of Justice has been known to call on these brave men when conventional law enforcement can no longer cope with the circumstances at hand. \n\nIn recognition of these facts, and in view of the circumstances we now face, we will once again call on the Pinkertons for help. Their use will be invaluable in crushing the most recalcitrant of socialist agitators and other criminals who wish to destabilize our way of life and the capitalist system."

USA_parochial_policing_desc:0 "The institution of the Sherriff is one of America’s noblest and best offices. Answerable to only the citizens and the constitutions of state and nation, they are as democratic as American law enforcement can be. As a result, the institutions Sheriff stands and acts on behalf of the interests of the ordinary citizenship, and symbolizes all that is good about law and order in our nation. Why then should we attempt to do with it in favor of federal agencies with diktats from Washington? \n\nInstead, we will continue to defer to the Sheriff’s departments in everyday law enforcement, and further cooperate with them in our national anti-criminal effort, rather than attempting to supplant them."

Its Protestant morality and sensibilities have been enshrined. The prosperity brought about by our Capitalist system has not only been safeguarded, but brought to greater heights than ever before. And the purity of culture and blood in our nation has been defended against the potential dangers of alien intrusion. Never has there been a time when our shining city on the hill has drawn closer to the dream which our Founders had for it, than now. n\nGod bless America!"

With the NPP now in power, he has approached us with a vision for \"the Galahad Fellowship\" to be formed and sister schools to the original college to be opened nationwide.

USA_lolberts_paradise_desc:0 "The Gilded Age represented a peak in the industrialization and enrichment of America. And for all the complaints of Socialist agents, it must be remembered that these developments occured amidst a period of limited government intervention and generally freedom of business pratice. With this in mind, we will make laissez-faire capitalism the stated pratice and value of our administration and America going forward, so that we may witness a new Gilded Age."

While we can implement all the reforms and protections we want, if we want them to be of genuine use, we need the money to make it. What better place to look then towards the Ultra-Rich, the top 1% of the 1%?

USA_combat_capitalism_desc:0 "One issue that has always been on the Populist Party's agenda has been the dismantling of the oppressive Capitalist System. Since coming into power, we have seemingly lacked sufficient reason to go after key figures within that system. \n\nThat was until today, as President [USA.GetLeader] has announced that evidence has been uncovered linking former President Garner, General Douglass MacArthur, Henry Ford and a litany of other names in a plot to ensure that the United States fell into civil war, to establish the permanent dictatorship of Capital over America. With this justification, lawsuits, crackdowns and other such actions are beginning to be implemented, and the forces of Capital are at last feeling what was long due."

In order to solve this issue and to strike against one of the most egregious specimens of a Capitalist Roadster, a series of bills have proposed in Congress, aimed at curtailing the powers of the Robber Barons.

In practice, the reality is much less promising, with a general disenfranchisement of the Colored races, corrupt elites treating many rural regions as fiefs and blatant corruption and violence at the polls.

While the Dixiecrats do not represent nearly as existential a threat for the PP, they are still a serious problem to our ambitions in the South. For this reason, we will undertake a campaign to weaken Dixiecrat strongholds and institutions and insert our own men into them.

Add to this a history as a bulwark of reactionary and corrupt elites on the national stage, and you have the greatest threat to the common man in America. The only solution is to leverage the full power of the state apparatus against these forces, to utterly dismantle and level their political power. Southern Chauvinism must be ruthlessly and completely exterminated!"

USA_ensure_election_fairness_desc:0 "Given the corruption, violence and outright incompetence displayed at the local level throughout America, it would be unreasonable to claim that the current electoral process is truly fair. While private citizens and public figures have attempted to act in the defense of the popular will, they have all too often been overcome by malicious forces. The only solution is therefore to establish a national organ for monitor elections fairly and universally. To this end, we will work towards the establishment of a national board of electoral supervisors, appointed by Congress, to safeguard our democratic process."

With the old Dixiecrat establishment out of the way, and the old AFP apparatus reconstituted, the South and Mid-West have never been more firmly under our control. Having united with the labor movement in the North, we can also establish ourselves in what was previously the region most hostile to us.

USA_riding_to_victory:0 "Riding to Victory"
USA_riding_to_victory_desc:0 "One of the major issues faced by Colored voters in this country is their inability to make it to the polls in the first place. While our efforts to dismantle the most obvious racial chauvinism and open intimidation practiced in the South may have borne fruit, this behavior has not been wholly eradicated. Contested areas still bear witness to political meddling, alongside other less obvious obstacles. Finding transport to the polls is an especially difficult endeavor, especially in rural areas, where infrastructure and transport is rudimentary. \n\nIn the spirit of democratic equality, we will organize an effort to safely bring these voters to the polls, so that they can make their voices heard."

USA_the_peoples_court_desc:0 "The Supreme Court was intended to act as a neutral and apolitical force, ensuring that the law was written and enforced in line with the spirit of the Constitution. In practice, the court has been utterly captured by the entrenched establishment and acts contrary to its role.

Consequently, it should be no surprise that the Constitution which they drafted was an exceptional document for the ages. While we may amend the Constitution to adapt to the ages, we should never think that we can do better by abandoning it. For just as the Magna Carta enshrined the principles of English liberty for centuries, so too will our Constitution safeguard the freedom of all Americans for centuries to come. \n\nSo let us cherish and preserve it, as we remember the men who drafted it."
USA_fate_of_the_electoral_college:0 "The Fate of the Electoral College"
USA_fate_of_the_electoral_college_desc:0 "The Electoral College has long be one of the most controversial institutions with American political life. While its original goal was to allow for a balance of political power between states of varying sizes and populations, the system has gradually broken down in the last century. The development of infrastructure and urbanization has made the country easier to travel and more disparate in population. \n\nAt the same time, the development of political machines has led to partisan capture of many state legislatures, allowing small entrenched elites to vote contrary to popular will. And while the allocation of electors may mitigate the effects, they cannot fundamentally solve the issue. To truly resolve it, the only solution may be the outright abolition of the college."

USA_the_second_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "In rising against the British and fighting for a more free and representative America, the founders showed their essentially populist and egalitarian character. Nevertheless, theirs was a fundamentally Bourgeoise revolution, motivated primarily by issues of taxation and particularly beneficial to that class. More clearly reprehensible was their treatment of the Negroes, who would be held in bondage for almost a century more, and whose conditions remain deplorable. \n\nAs such, the time has now come for parting way with the legacy of the Founders. We will convene a new Constitutional Convention, and draft a new guiding document truly capable of forwarding the rights and interests of proletarian America."

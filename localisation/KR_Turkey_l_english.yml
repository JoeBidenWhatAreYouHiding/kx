### Events ###

turkey.1.t:0 "Armed Putsch"
turkey.1.d:0 "The latest disasters suffered by our country have proved that our tyrannical leadership is completely incompetent and unfit to rule. A group of officers with the silent support of the General Staff have launched a putsch aimed at deposing the sultan."
turkey.1.a:0 "Putsch overthrows the sultan! A republic is declared!"

turkey.2.t:0 "Future of Turkey"
turkey.2.d:0 "After the catastrophes of the last years there's no doubt that Ottoman Empire cannot exist much longer. A group of radical officers announced the creation of a new country - the Republic of Turkey, but the future of this country is still unknown. Various cliques within the armed forces are locked in a struggle to gain control of the situation..."
turkey.2.a:0 "Nihal Atsız will lead the broken nation to revenge!"
turkey.2.b:0 "Şefik Hüsnü will introduce syndicalism!"
turkey.2.c:0 "Turkey needs unity and stability."

turkey.3.t:0 "Foreign policy"
turkey.3.d:0 "With the Turkish people finally free from the oppressive rule of the Sultans we can now freely decide our stance towards the international community. While many are arguing for an immediate alliance with other syndicalist nations, it might be wise enough to remain neutral to rebuild our country."
turkey.3.a:0 "We must join arms with France."
turkey.3.b:0 "Isolationism, we must organise our country."

turkey.4.t:0 "Turkey wants to join the Syndicalists"
turkey.4.d:0 "Republic of Turkey has expressed a desire to join the Syndicalist bloc. It should not be considered a sudden move, as pro-syndicalist policies are popular in many circles including the government and army. Do we want Turkish workers joining the crusade against bloodthirsty Germans and rotten imperialist Canadian pigs?"
turkey.4.a:0 "Yes!"
turkey.4.b:0 "Rather not."

turkey.5.t:0 "We join the syndicalist bloc"
turkey.5.d:0 "The French and British are happy to see us joining the common cause - destroying the evil imperialists. Now we are part of the syndicalist bloc."
turkey.5.a:0 "This time we will win!"

turkey.6.t:0 "France rejects our membership!"
turkey.6.d:0 "Unbelievable! The Commune of France has rejected our request to join the Internationale!"
turkey.6.a:0 "We will build syndicalism on our own!"

turkey.7.t:0 "Land claims of the Bozkurt Council"
turkey.7.d:0 "Colonel Nihal Atsız, leader of the Bozkurt Council, has announced the geo-political targets of the great Turkish race..."
turkey.7.a:0 "We will regain the lands of our ancestors!"
turkey.7.b:0 "We will reclaim all Turkish lands!"
turkey.7.c:0 "We will crush the Greeks!"
turkey.7.e:0 "No revenge, peace!"

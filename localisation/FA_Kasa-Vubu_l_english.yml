outerheaven.1.t:0 "Creating the Mercenary Committee"
outerheaven.1.d:0 "Jacques Massu leads the brave mercenaries of the West Congo in rebellion against the tyrannical Pierre Ryckmans as the Congo, and Mittelafrika as a whole, dissolve into a maelstrom of disorder and lawlessness. Under his guidance, we have revolted against the oppressive regime in the capital, seeking to bring true freedom to these dark jungles. However, many in our ranks seek to incorporate all of the various mercenary companies scattered across the Congo, uniting under one banner to fight for our right to wage war and live as we see fit. Leading this opposition is none other than famous explorer and soldier-for-hire Carl Gustaf von Rosen. The grizzled veteran serves as a unifying figure amongst the disparate mercenary groups, and many in our inner-circle feel that his inclusion would spell the end of our administration’s rule as we fall subservient to Rosen’s rule. How shall we go forward?"

outerheaven.1.b:0 "Allow Rosen in"

outerheaven.2.t:0 "Rosen's Coup"
outerheaven.2.d:0 "With the various clans and outfits of mercenaries supporting him, Carl Gustaf von Rosen has secured control over the hordes of hired guns that were currently revolting from Pierre Ryckmans’ regime. Under the stalwart soldier’s skill and guidance, we shall march from Coquilhatville and descend into the greater Congo, spreading our influence as we hack our enemies down at every turn. We will carve out our own independent state free from the lording fools in Dar-Es-Salaam and Leopoldville. As we march towards our uncertain destiny, the lessons of von Rosen echo in the minds of each of our soldiers. “A strong man doesn’t need to see the future…he makes his own.”"

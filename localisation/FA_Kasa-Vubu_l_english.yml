### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ROSEN_DESC:0 "The last of a dying breed, Carl Gustaf von Rosen is the epitome of the honorable mercenary ideal. Born in 1909 in Helgesta to the famous Swedish explorer Eric von Rosen, adventure and the pursuit of glory has always been in Carl’s blood despite being labeled the black sheep of his family. Taking an interest in mechanics and aeronautics at a young age, the young von Rosen became obsessed with flight and speed. Studying at Lundsbergs and AB Aeromateriel, Carl would train to become a test pilot and a barnstormer, doing death-defying stunts of acrobatics within his flying machines, cementing his love of the air. During the early 30s, the young von Rosen learned of the atrocities committed at the hands of numerous colonial regimes across Africa, and so took it upon himself to fly relief missions for those poor souls whose lives were racked by war and conflict they themselves did not start. Flying for rebels in Kenya, separatists in Nigeria, and for natives in the Congo, Carl showed his true colors as a man of the people and a true freedom-fighter, especially against those regimes who would use horrific weapons of a biological or chemical nature, like the governments of Westafrika and Südwestafrika. With this infamous career, von Rosen made a name for himself across Africa as a guardian to the downtrodden and as the archetypal mercenary lord. With the power struggle to control the Mercenaries du Congo Ouest now over, von Rosen now amasses his band of flyboys and hired-guns, seeking to transform the Congo into a free, noble, and secure state under the watch of his airwings and legions. Only under their new Consul shall this ancient Eden be made civilized and equal."
POLITICS_MASSU_DESC:0 "The young officer-turned-mercenary Jacques Massu has lived through a violent career in his short life. Born in 1908 in France before the fall of the Empire, Massu was just a child when Paris fell and the Commune rose, and witnessed the fall of an empire with his very own eyes as brother fought brother in the Fall of France before finally escaping to Algiers with his family. Burning with a patriotic zeal common for men in the nationalist exile regime in Algiers, Massu fell into a military life as soon as he came of age, and spent much of his early military career crushing Tuaregs and other tribes of the Sahara for the Petain regime. Growing disillusioned with his government’s ‘righteous destiny’ to reclaim the Metropole, Massu and a retinue of his closest comrades and followers fled from French Chad into Sub-Saharan Africa, finding themselves in the Vrijstaat and finding quick positions within the Force Publique as foreign hires. As Massu and his men continued their work under the FP, they increasingly began to fall further into ‘corrupt’ practices, such as taking bribes or looting tribal settlements, quickly picking up a taste for the mercenary lifestyle while furthering their own deluded sense of morality under Massu’s new ‘knightly’ codes. After their commanding officers in the Force Publique had gotten wind of the nature of their new habits, Massu and his men were once again forced to flee. However, this time they would not flee to another colony or regime, but to the Jungle itself, seeking to carve out their own mercenary fiefdom based on Massu’s own twisted ideas of chivalry free from the prying eyes and nagging rules of other lesser regimes."
POLITICS_HALLSTROM_DESC:0 "Few men could manage to control the varied groups and cliques within the Mercenaries du Congo Ouest, let alone forge them into a unified front, and yet Gustaf Hallström has managed to do just that. Born in 1880 to Swedish school teachers, Gustaf spent much of his young life pursuing higher education, studying to become an antiquarian, an archaeologist, and a philosopher at Uppsala University - a stark contrast to the background of many others within this brotherhood. Under this career, Hallström became famous within academic circles for his work on documenting the petroglyphs of the Sami peoples, with each dig having him further languish away in stuffy academia until the call of adventure landed upon his ear. \n\nDriven on largely by his soldier-turned-adventurer for a brother, Thord Ivor Hallström, Gustaf would drop his life of digging in the snow and mud for a lifetime of action and pursuing the true unknown. Arriving in Mittelafrika from Sweden in the mid-1920’s, Gustaf, along with Ivor and his other brother Gunnar - the famed artist and intellectual, carved his way through the dark expanse of Africa, taking odd jobs as soldiers-of-fortune and explorers while slowly amassing their group of dedicated lackeys and followers. Seeing the Congo as the final true African frontier and the last place on Earth free from the prying eyes of the modern world, the Hallström brothers slowly made their way deeper into this primordial jungle, integrating with other mercenary groups until the Mercenaries du Congo Ouest was formed and grew strong enough to cast off the shackles of colonial rule. Now, with the colonials dead and the old order toppled, the Congo now stands as a new cornucopia of opportunity for Hallström and his men - a perfect heaven and hideaway here at the Dark Heart of Africa."

outerheaven.1.t:0 "Creating the Mercenary Committee"
outerheaven.1.d:0 "Jacques Massu leads the brave mercenaries of the West Congo in rebellion against the tyrannical Pierre Ryckmans as the Congo, and Mittelafrika as a whole, dissolve into a maelstrom of disorder and lawlessness. Under his guidance, we have revolted against the oppressive regime in the capital, seeking to bring true freedom to these dark jungles. However, many in our ranks seek to incorporate all of the various mercenary companies scattered across the Congo, uniting under one banner to fight for our right to wage war and live as we see fit. Leading this opposition is none other than famous explorer and soldier-for-hire Gustaf Hallstrom. The grizzled veteran serves as a unifying figure amongst the disparate mercenary groups, and many in our inner-circle feel that his inclusion would spell the end of our administration’s rule as we fall subservient to Hallstrom’s rule. How shall we go forward?"

outerheaven.2.t:0 "Hallstrom's Coup"
outerheaven.2.d:0 "With the various clans and outfits of mercenaries supporting him, Gustaf Hallstrom has secured control over the hordes of hired guns that were currently revolting from Pierre Ryckmans’ regime. Under the stalwart soldier’s skill and guidance, we shall march from Coquilhatville and descend into the greater Congo, spreading our influence as we hack our enemies down at every turn. We will carve out our own independent state free from the lording fools in Dar-Es-Salaam and Leopoldville. As we march towards our uncertain destiny, the lessons of von Hallstrom echo in the minds of each of our soldiers. “A strong man doesn’t need to see the future...he makes his own.”"
outerheaven.2.a:0 "This is our only home. Our heaven and our hell. This is Outer Heaven."

outerheaven.3.t:0 "Of Mercs and Men"
outerheaven.3.d:0 "Hired armies, soldiers of fortune, and other forms of mercenaries have been used in Africa for centuries, but the Vrijstaat has turned the practice into a practical arm of the state. Before the fall of Mittelafrika, mercs would be frequently used to supplement the Force Publique, with each payment upon services rendered adding to their strength and hunger for more war and profit. \n\nThe Mercenaries de Congo Ouest are the largest coalition of these mercenary groups in Africa, and possibly the world - a misfit band of thugs, soldiers, adventurers, poachers, thieves, hunters, sailors, pilots, and so many more banded together under one common identity and profession. With the collapse of the German colonial empire in Africa, this band of thieves has seized on the chance to declare their own sovereign mercenary state, and now they must fight for their lives to earn their right to independence. \n\nThe love of thrills and the unknown are what has driven them all to join up together as one, united band of mercenaries, for even mercs know that there is always strength and opportunity in numbers. However, our brotherhood is not as united and jovial as it may seem, and even now the various internal factions vye power and influence as [KSV.getleader] tries to lead us through these hellish times. Now, with our backs to the wall and all of the Congo against us, we must fight tooth and nail to carve out our own sector of the world here in the Dark Heart of Africa."
outerheaven.3.a:0 "No masters or gods, only war and adventure!"

outerheaven.4.t:0 "A Struggle for the Heart of Africa"
outerheaven.4.d:0 "The varied mercenaries of the Congo have long fought in this hell; the bones of their brothers strewn about these jungles and mires, far from the lands of their birth. The beasts and savages who visited such a craven death upon our comrades have since been brought to the sword, and now the only thing that stands in the way of total peace within this primordial thicket is each other. With the foes who solidified our cooperation now buried beneath the mud, the sights of the largest and most ambitious camps and cliques within our brotherhood have now all leveleved their sights upon one another, and the tense atmosphere of coming war hands in the air. \n\nThe three main cliques that hold any chance of winning could not be more different in their approach, both to war and in how they administer their own forces. The favorite to win the struggle, with the largest amassed force and the widest range of weapons of war at his disposal, is Gustaf Hallström who along with his two brothers aim to create a true and pure mercenary state entirely devoted to the pursuit of war, adventure, and profit while remaining free from the entanglements of foreign diplomacy. Ready to use experimental weaponry, gas tactics, and other cutthroat methods, Hallström and his clique shall be a tough force to overcome. The main rival to this cut-throat force of true soldiers of fortune is the second largest faction within our brotherhood, belonging to Carl Gustaf von Rosen. A famous pilot and freedom fighter, von Rosen leads his diverse force of former Askari, wartime pilots, and less biased soldiers within our ranks as the new Mark Antony or Consul of the Congo, seeking to carve out an egalitarian and colorblind mercenary republic based on Roman idealism and meritocratic beliefs. The darkhorse of the competition, leading a smaller force than either that of Hallström’s or von Rosen’s, is Chevalier Jacques Massu, who has quickly become known as the Congolese Knight or the Dauphin of Congo Ouest. Massu, still holding connections to Entente contacts from his time in the Algiers Regime, is well funded and well supplied, and though he and his chivalric knights are greatly outnumbered, they still have a solid chance in the coming battle. \n\nAs these forces prepare for the coming final battle, all within the Congo have grown tense as this wartorn Eden once more marches to the sounds of war drums and battle cries. Meeting on the great plateau that overlooks the Lufira river in Katanga, each of these three warlords have rallied their forces and now march against each other, rifles in hand and weapons at the ready. As the sound of dive bombing aircraft and thunderous artillery begin to shake the earth and shatter the skies, it has become clear to all that war has once again reached the Congo, and this time, hopefully, it shall be the final fight for some time."

outerheaven.5.t:0 "The Legate of the Congo’s Skies Takes Command"
outerheaven.5.d:0 "With his enemies defeated, his clique’s power and cohesion fully coalesced, and after constant struggle, both through diplomacy and conflict, Carl Gustaf von Rosen, the modern Marc Antony of the Congo, has finally come to control the entirety of this primordial Eden. Though this ‘total-control’ is entirely nominal, as most of the Congo still exists as an unpatrolled and uncontrolled, disconnected quagmire, none can deny von Rosen is now the most powerful man in the nation, and his forces are now the undisputed masters of this wild expanse. Now the world must watch with bated breath as the new Consul of the Congo strives to create his unique martial republic as the skies over this paradise become black with his aerial forces."

outerheaven.6.t:0 "The Chevalier of the Congo Surmounts All Obstacles"
outerheaven.6.d:0 "With the savages that comprised the ranks of von Rosen and Hallström’s cliques now thoroughly dealt with, all either defeated or absorbed in our growing order, the Knight of the Congo Jacques Massu now stands as the herald of this Eden’s new destiny. With this brave and studied soldier at the helm, Massu and his new retinue of mercenary lords and modern knights shall strive to purify the Congo of sin and dishonor, for the new foundations of Massu’s fiefdom shall be built upon his deep, albeit warped, understandings of chivalry, honor, and duty. For his brothers in arms and potentially for his formed homeland, Chevalier Massu, the newly christened Dauphin of the Congo, will ride forth into a glorious future as the champion and architect of our newly purified and reformed brotherhood."
outerheaven.6.a:0 "The Congo bows to its new Dauphin."

outerheaven.7.t:0 "A Soldiers Republic or a Council of Mercs?"
outerheaven.7.d:0 "As Carl Gustaf von Rosen has solidified his power base and anchored his position as the undisputed top man in the Congo, a nagging question has throbbed in the back of his mind - a question on national determination \n\n Von Rosen has long been sympathetic to the plight of people fighting for their natural right to govern themselves, to dictate how their own lives should be lived. With his mercs now allowing Congolese and European soldiers to fight and serve as total equals within our brotherhood and with our armed forces encompassing all aspects of our state, perhaps the time has come for von Rosen to finally break the final barrier and enact the scheme he has long pondered on. \n\n If enacted, von Rosen would open up local ‘democratic’ elections to all official citizens of our nation while allowing any previously-vetted citizen to run for office, with von Rosen of course staying as the Consul of the nation above all. However, since the only requirement to being a citizen is not race nor gender, but the ability to serve one’s own nation and its military in any way, it would in effect enfranchise all adults within the Congo that are enrolled in our army. Any man or woman who can carry a rifle or otherwise serve their nation and its military shall be given the full right to participate in this soldiers' republic. \n\nA revolutionary idea emulating the ideas of Rome and not seen in wide-scale use for centuries, this style of governance would be one of the single largest democratic transitions in modern history, affecting the lives of millions, though it would still be a far cry from modern Western-style democracies like France before the revolution or the United States before their recent turmoils. Just as easily, it could lead to the decay and eventual collapse of our nation as we fall under the tide of ineffectual governance at the hands of lead-for-brains mercs and conscripted Africans serving their own interests. \n\nThis uncertainty has been cause for enough concern, and an alternative idea has grown popular to oppose von Rosen’s naive dream. This alternate camp seeks to instead go for a more traditional and less radical governmental system where von Rosen would serve as the head of state with a council of his most trusted officers and native allies under him serving as advisor and administrators. Though less revolutionary and egalitarian, this system would almost certainly be more stable, though would also likely cause more instability with the locals. In the end, only von Rosen can make the decision, and with it he shall sign away the fate of tens of the millions across the heart of Africa."
outerheaven.7.a:0 "Only through martial prowess and guided democracy can the Congo be truly Safed."
outerheaven.7.b:0 "Let us not be too hasty or foolish. A council of trusted officers shall rule under von Rosen."

outerheaven.8.t:0 "The Foundations of our ‘Democracy’"
outerheaven.8.d:0 "With Consul Carl Gustaf von Rosen’s decision to go forward with his dream of a soldiers republic here in the Congo, the foundations of this new republican government must be established. \n\nIn effect, the votes of our citizen-soldier shall only really matter at the local level, for anything resembling a national-level government is directly under the control of von Rosen and his closest advisors, aptly titled his Praetors. Below these loyal servants to our Consul, the various lower level elected officials, from our promagistrates to our local governors, shall handle the more monotonous, tedious local governance. Their ranks shall all be citizens of our nation, ranging from allied tribal chiefs and lords to influential colonials remaining in our borders. However, while to the wider public this new governmental system may seem like a united, or at-least semi-united front, in reality the ranks under von Rosen are a political warzone of vying cliques and interests all battling for control, figuratively and also sometimes literally going to war with each other for influence within this Soldiers Republic. With these forces jockeying for influence, von Rosen must choose a clique once more to set a definitive path and creed for this new republic. \n\nThe three main cliques are composed of a wide variety of forces. The most influential clique is mostly made up of various mercenaries, higher ranking government officials including most of our Praetorians to many of our loyal governors, our aerial legionnaire commanders, and myriads of regular citizen-soldiers who all follow von Rosen without question and adhere strictly to our old mercenary spirit, forming the Old Guard of our nation’s political and military sectors, as if they were separate. These veterans of our initial struggle against Massu and the Hallström Brothers simply want to adhere to our traditions - that we are mercenaries and soldiers first, politicians and nation-builders second. \n\nOpposing them are two much larger but less influential groups. The first of these groups are the less conservative, or more profit-orientated comrades of the Old Guard, as well as many of the renaming colonial assets within our government, particularly the UMHK. This coalition of colonials and money-hungry mercenaries are like a band of thieves and tycoons keen on reaping the Congo of its economic treasures. Following them are also many of the more adventure-oriented types within our ranks, who seek to scour the Congo for its abundance of artefacts and mysteries, with prominent archeologists and adventures such as Sir Leonard Wooley, Hiram Bingham, Henri Breuil, and Roy Chapman Adams all being affiliated with their ranks, and many others.  Finally, the largest but weakest of the cliques, only due to rabid suppression from the other two groups, is the ‘Humanitarian Clique’ - a group of bleeding-heart mercenaries, opportunistic populists, allied African representatives and nationalists, and the bulk of our conscripted Black soldiers who all seek a more equitable, egalitarian, and truly democratic system based more closely on the Roman Senate and their archaic republicanism. Whichever faction wins out, nothing shall change the fact that all in the Congo must kneel before the Consul, for von Rosen’s word is supreme."

After reveling in the glorious cacophony of war, we have emerged triumphant, clutching both victory and the Congo in our palms as we stand atop a mountain of corpses and ash. Now, it is up to our fractorious and schismatic band of brothers to settle our differences once and for all in order to finally declare a new master of this dark heart of Africa."

In order to abate this crisis, a new joint committee must be created, drawing from each of the major groups, cliques, and factions within our brotherhood. By pooling together and working to an agreeable compromise is the only way this mercenary horde shall be able to cooperate long enough to be able to establish the foundations of our new regime without spilling more precious blood."

Pharmaceuticals inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Genetic control, information control, emotion control, battlefield control...everything is monitored and kept under control. \nWar...has changed. \nThe age of ingenuity has become the age of control, all in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction, and he who controls the battlefield, controls history.

Everything at our disposal from the newest radio technologies to simple telegrams and messenger pigeons shall link together our cadre, allowing us to grow our influence and further spread our strengthening facade. The world must never learn that we are truly in control of the Congo, and with a wider network of contacts at our disposal, keeping the truth buried in this primordial jungle shall be much easier."

We searched for ore and land, for years and years we surveyed, as we gazed a gazeless stare at the natural bounties of this paradise - the Congo. We’ve dug a million mines, and our foes must have died alone, a long, long time ago. Who knows?

Drawing from his own views on biologic-racial theory and from the writings of the likes of Charles Darwin, Arthur de Gobineau, and Lothrop Stoddard, Boss Hallström seeks to usher in a new era of scientific thought to our new state. Through the application of modern, scientific ideas about race, ethnicity, and nationality and their ties to intelligence, obedience, and other traits, we shall devise better methods of keeping control over this unruly jungle."

Good soldiers follow orders. The state and our regime must be the single most important thing in the heart of all our battlebrothers, and loyalty to this state must be paramount.

KSV_fight_for_what_we_belive_in_desc:0 "Though we are brigands and soldiers, mercenaries and hired murderers, that does not mean we do not have principles. War may be a chaotic cacophony that fosters death and horrific, immoral acts, but it is also a beautiful artscape that we have mastered through raw skill and practice, infusing our own ideas and notions on subjective morality to make this most holy of acts truly righteous. We charge forth into the maelstrom that swirls around our destiny, clutching tight to our honor and our ideals as we endeavor to never lose sight of ourselves and our principles as we rage against the civilized world as the new masters of conflict."
KSV_no_masters:0 "No Masters..."

Between our battlebrothers stands multiple millennia of combined combat experience, evolving these once mere veterans into the best of the best of the best that the world can offer."
KSV_war_and_adventure:0 "Only War and Adventure!"
KSV_war_and_adventure_desc:0 "This paradise has been molded by our brotherhood to meet the needs and desires of our men without revealing our true nature to the wider world. As the rest of the world looks on seeing the ‘true’ Vrijstaat continuing its mandate, they are blinded by our facade, hiding our true intentions and goals. This secrecy has given us the freedom to pursue life as we see fit as the proven masters of both the Congo and conflict itself, and with this gift we have created the perfect society. Greed, hollow faith, and self-serving political ambition have all been purged or otherwise cast aside, shedding the weaknesses that plague lesser men. Only war, only adventure truly matters!"

Under his rule, the Congo shall be transformed into Massu’s own personal feudalist fiefdom, based around a mercenary-noble class that serves as the landowners, with other allied native chiefs and colonial remnants serving as subordinate ‘lords.’ Under this system, the Congo shall fuse modernity with tradition, forming a new knightly state here in the dark heart of Africa."

KSV_union_minire_ties_desc:0 "If our new chivalric state is to survive, we must make amends with the colonialist industrialists that once ran the entirety of the Congo’s economy. The main focus of our efforts should be on the UMHK - the single largest corporation within not only Congo but all of Africa, accounting for over 70% of our economy before the outbreak of the civil war.

KSV_re_use_colonial_infrastructure_desc:0 "The Congo is rife with viable infrastructure left over from the former colonial regime. Both the Flandro-Wallonians and the Germans poured millions into the Vrijstaat to modernize their holdings, creating new rail networks, telegraph and electrical grids, and sewer systems across the more densely populated urban and rural regions.

KSV_ignore_natives_desc:0 "The native Congolese fought hard for their right to govern themselves, and though they ultimately lost to the might of our mercenaries, they still stood firm as worthy foes only seeking the noble cause of self-determination. We shall humbly grant them this request, and leave the natives of the Congo to their own devices. Their various chiefs, presidents, tribal lords, and other leaders shall serve as nominal lords under Dauphin Massu, each free to govern their own people as they see fit without meddling or interference from our regime. All they need to do in return is pay regular tribute to our forces to ensure their continued protection."

His mercenary forces patrol these jungles and primordial groves as the final and highest law in the land, with all of the Congo at their feet. Massu’s mercenaries serve as the new noble class of our society, standing as true paragons of chivalry and the new archetypal embodiment of modern knightly ideals. Our Knightly Order of the Congo has brought stability and honor to these wild lands, and we shall not rest until this entire expanse we control is made civilized and to pay their rightful tribute to their new lords."

A fully cohesive and functional ‘mercenary feudalist’ society has been formed, with the lords and royals of old being replaced by mercenary officers, loyal native leaders, and the old corporate colonial barons of old who were intelligent enough to accept our offer.

This spirit of aiding those in need has begun to rub off on many of those within this Swede’s clique, and many have moved to emulate his graciousness. Our mercenaries shall be trained and encouraged to not only hone their skills of war, but to also hone their ability to help others, for we may revel in the beauty that is war, but regular civilians do not.

KSV_outplay_the_big_dogs_desc:0 "The Entente and the Third Internationale stand as the most direct threat to our rule, for the Germans seem none-too-concerned by our mandate so long as they still receive their promised profits from the UMHK. With this in mind, we must play these other two world-class alliances off eachother like fools to both weaken their own positions and to improve our own. We shall worm our way into their systems and their networks, siphoning their information and their strength as we play them off each other and make them out to be fools for our own profit and amusement."

KSV_rule_from_the_sky_desc:0 "The skies are the limit, and luckily none fly farther and faster than the men of Consul von Rosen’s flying brigades. Under the steely-eyed watch of these warhawks and their ground liaisons within our mercenary brotherhood, the expanse of the Congo and its surrounding lands throughout Central Africa are surveyed day and night, patrolled for possible conflicts and adventures ripe for our men to join in on. From the skies, we shall rule over this paradise as its new masters as we command the skies, the jungles, and the Congo itself to our whims."

POLITICS_ROSEN_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_MASSU_DESC:0 "The young officer-turned-mercenary Jacques Massu has lived a violent career in his young life. Born in 1908 in France before the fall of the Empire, Massu was just a child when Paris fell and the Commune rose, and witnessed the fall of an empire with his very own eyes as brother fought brother in the Fall of France before finally escaping to Algiers with his family. Burning with a patriotic zeal common for men in the nationalist exile regime in Algiers, Massu fell into a military life as soon as he came of age, and spent much of his early military career crushing Tuaregs and other tribes of the Sahara for the Petain regime. Growing disillusioned with his government’s ‘righteous destiny’ to reclaim the Metropole, Massu and a retinue of his closest comrades and followers fled from French Chad into Sub-Saharan Africa, finding themselves in the Vrijstaat and finding quick positions within the Force Publique as foreign hires. As Massu and his men continued their work under the FP, they increasingly began to fall further into ‘corrupt’ practices, such as taking bribes or looting tribal settlements, quickly picking up a taste for the mercenary lifestyle. After their commanding officers in the Force Publique had gotten wind of the nature of their new habits, Massu and his men were once again forced to flee. However, this time they would not flee to another colony or regime, but to the Jungle itself, seeking to carve out their own mercenary state free from the prying eyes and nagging rules of other regimes."

KSV_mercs_not_governors_desc:0 "Though the varied men of our ranks hold all manner of unique talents and skills, a knack for true statecraft is not one of them. In truth, we have next to no idea how to truly govern a populace or run a state, for we have about as many administrators and bureaucrats currently within our ranks as we do women or dead men. We must remedy this shortcoming at once, lest we too fall into collapse and chaos."

outerheaven.1.t:0 "Creating the Mercenary Committee"
outerheaven.1.d:0 "Jacques Massu leads the brave mercenaries of the West Congo in rebellion against the tyrannical Pierre Ryckmans as the Congo, and Mittelafrika as a whole, dissolve into a maelstrom of disorder and lawlessness. Under his guidance, we have revolted against the oppressive regime in the capital, seeking to bring true freedom to these dark jungles. However, many in our ranks seek to incorporate all of the various mercenary companies scattered across the Congo, uniting under one banner to fight for our right to wage war and live as we see fit. Leading this opposition is none other than famous explorer and soldier-for-hire Gustaf Hallstrom. The grizzled veteran serves as a unifying figure amongst the disparate mercenary groups, and many in our inner-circle feel that his inclusion would spell the end of our administration’s rule as we fall subservient to Hallstrom’s rule. How shall we go forward?"
outerheaven.1.a:0 "Massu will Rule Alone, forget Hallstrom"
outerheaven.1.b:0 "Allow Hallstrom in"

outerheaven.2.t:0 "Hallstrom's Coup"
outerheaven.2.d:0 "With the various clans and outfits of mercenaries supporting him, Gustaf Hallstrom has secured control over the hordes of hired guns that were currently revolting from Pierre Ryckmans’ regime. Under the stalwart soldier’s skill and guidance, we shall march from Coquilhatville and descend into the greater Congo, spreading our influence as we hack our enemies down at every turn. We will carve out our own independent state free from the lording fools in Dar-Es-Salaam and Leopoldville. As we march towards our uncertain destiny, the lessons of von Hallstrom echo in the minds of each of our soldiers. “A strong man doesn’t need to see the future...he makes his own.”"
outerheaven.2.a:0 "This is our only home. Our heaven and our hell. This is Outer Heaven."

outerheaven.3.t:0 "Of Mercs and Men
outerheaven.3.d:0 "Hired armies, soldiers of fortune, and other forms of mercenaries have been used in Africa for centuries, but the Vrijstaat has turned the practice into a practical arm of the state. Before the fall of Mittelafrika, mercs would be frequently used to supplement the Force Publique, with each payment upon services rendered adding to their strength and hunger for more war and profit. \n\nThe Mercenaries de Congo Ouest are the largest coalition of these mercenary groups in Africa, and possibly the world - a misfit band of thugs, soldiers, adventurers, poachers, thieves, hunters, sailors, pilots, and so many more banded together under one common identity and profession. With the collapse of the German colonial empire in Africa, this band of thieves has seized on the chance to declare their own sovereign mercenary state, and now they must fight for their lives to earn their right to independence. \n\nThe love of thrills and the unknown are what has driven them all to join up together as one, united band of mercenaries, for even mercs know that there is always strength and opportunity in numbers. However, our brotherhood is not as united and jovial as it may seem, and even now the various internal factions vye power and influence as [KSV.getleader] tries to lead us through these hellish times. Now, with our backs to the wall and all of the Congo against us, we must fight tooth and nail to carve out our own sector of the world here in the Dark Heart of Africa."

KSV_battle_for_the_heart_of_the_congo_desc:0 "In screaming defiance of the old order, we Mercenaries de Congo Ouest raged against the dying regime that once controlled the Vrijstaat. After reveling in the glorious cacophony of war, we have emerged triumphant, clutching both victory and the Congo in our palms as we stand atop a mountain of corpses and ash. Now, it is up to our fractorious and schismatic band of brothers to settle our differences once and for all in order to finally declare a new master of this dark heart of Africa."

KSV_set_up_the_commitee_desc:0 "The men of our merry band are at eachothers’ throats, and if this inner-conflict continues, we shall lose control over this prize and descend into chaos and war once more. In order to abate this crisis, a new joint committee must be created, drawing from each of the major groups, cliques, and factions within our brotherhood. By pooling together and working to an agreeable compromise is the only way this mercenary horde shall be able to cooperate long enough to be able to establish the foundations of our new state without spilling more precious blood."

Using the newfound plunder and loot earned in our conquest of the Congo, we shall pay the men and prepare them for war once more. One final battle awaits our brotherhood until we reach our new destiny, and the road to it shall be paved with skulls and blood as we march against our foes into our promised dawn. The only loyal mercenary is a paid one."

These titans and potential Bosses of the Mercenaries de Congo Ouest , namely Carl Gustaf von Rosen, Jacques Massau, and Thord Ivar Hallström, now stand as the last hopes and potential destinies for our newly independent mercenary state. Now, with our new state’s destiny hanging in the balance, these three men play their games of deception and intrigue in their own attempts to seize power once and for all, but only one shall emerge as the one true Boss."

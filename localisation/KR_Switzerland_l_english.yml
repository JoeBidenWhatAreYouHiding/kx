### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SWITZERLAND_COUNCIL_DESC: "Founded in 1848, the Swiss Federal Council is a seven-member executive council which serves as the collective head of state for Switzerland. Each council member heads one of seven different federal departments, and the position of Federal President moves between the seven Councillors every year, with the current year's Vice President serving as the next year's President."
POLITICS_BIRCHER_DESC: "A Germanophile and diehard anti-Syndicalist, Eugen Bircher is a physician by trade and invented several groundbreaking procedures dealing with arthroscopy of the knee. After the rise of Syndicalism in France Bircher largely gave up his medical work and founded the SVV, which quickly pervaded Swiss military and political circles as a counterbalance to the rising tide of Socialism in the nation."
POLITICS_ULRICH_WILLE_JR_DESC: "Former Infantry Chief of Arms, Corps Commander and the son of Ulrich Wille: the man to hold the Swiss Military’s highest position during the Weltkreig, Ulrich Wille Jr. has outmaneuvered his fellow officers taken the reign of the Swiss State in these turbulent times. Like his father he is an outspoken Germanophile who looks to Germany as a potential ally if the country would ever come under attack, and seeks to transform the Swiss Army along the Prussian line. Despite his powerful position within the Swiss Government and Military, his personal grudges against Henri Guisan have made him a contentious figure in the armed forces."
POLITICS_SONDEREGGER_DESC: "Born as the son of a wealthy embroidery businessman, Sonderegger worked for the export branch of his father's company, travelling extensively and developing strong language skills as a result; eventually leaving the family business to follow a career in the Swiss Army, rising to artillery lieutenant by 1888. While in the army he commanded the 4th Division and played a pivotal role in suppressing the General Strike in Zurich, routing several defiant socialist groups in small skirmishes. While he originally planned to resign from the army in the face of a proposed restructuring, the Syndicalist Revolution to the west convinced him to remain in the army and take an active part in the defense of the Swiss Nation. After a lucrative career in the arms manufacturing business, he turned to far-right politics, strongly opposing democracy and eventually going on to found the ‘Volksbund’ after a falling out with the right wing ‘National Front’. One of the leading figure in the Military Coup that followed the Savoyard Crisis, he gained complete control of the Swiss State following the dissolution of the Swiss Security Council and creation of the office of Chief Commander. "
POLITICS_SWITZERLAND_JUNTA_DESC: "A Military Coup following the Savoyard Crisis led to the end of the Swiss Federal Council which had governed our nation since its inception. In its stead is the temporary ‘Swiss Security Council’ - an unelected body made of military officers involved in the coup. While the nature of this council is interim, one can hardly imagine that it will acquiesce power back to democratic institutions once our crisis has ended; instead most predict that one central military figure will come to rule Switzerland as a dictator."
POLITICS_SWI_UNION_DESC: "The Federal Union Council is the temporary governmental body of the Swiss Syndicalist state after the overthrow of the government, dedicated to the stabilisation and reformation of the Swiss nation."
POLITICS_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTORY_DESC: "The Executive Directory acts as the permanent Helvetic Head of State in the wake of the revolution, occupying a similar position to the Federal Council of old, but with more executive power vested in the Directory to allow for more decisive action to be taken in times of crisis."
POLITICS_OLTRAMARE_DESC: "A lifelong fan of the Socialist work of Benito Mussolini, Georges Oltramare is a former novelist and active Syndicalist revolutionary who aims to shape Switzerland in his vision. A signatory of the Totalist charter, Oltramare's more extremist tendencies have caused a rift between his hardline faction the Union Nationale and the more mainstream Syndicalist elements within the nation."
POLITICS_GENEVA_DESC: "The temporary movement of the capital to Geneva has placed the burden of governance on the current Geneva Council of State, which has taken over control of the nation until a more permanent office can be created to guide the nation."

POLITICS_SWI_HENRI_GUISAN_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 21st, 1874\nMézières, Vaud, Switzerland\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in a French-speaking part of Switzerland, Guisan originally attended school and studied agricultural medicine. However, after entering the Swiss military in 1894, he has gradually climbed the ranks, and was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1932, the highest rank in peacetime. Guisan participates in politics less than many of his peers, and views the best path forward as neutrality by deterrance, supporting strong and elaborate defenses to make conquering Switzerland a long and painful feat."
POLITICS_SWI_EUGEN_BIRCHER_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 17th, 1882\nThun, Aargau, Switzerland\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAlong with Henri Guisan, Bircher occupies the highest rank of the Swiss military available during peacetime. However, unlike his equal, he spends much of his time in politics, spearheading a semi-secret far-right organization with great influence in the Swiss government."
POLITICS_SWI_ULRICH_WILLE_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 14, 1959 \nThun, Meilen, Switzerland\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhile Wille originally studied law, he eventually joined the Army and became an instructor. By 1931 he became Infantry Chief of Arms and eventually a Corps Commander. Like his father: Switzerland’s previous highest ranking Officer, Wille holds strong pro-German sympathies, sympathies that may come in clutch if our nation ever finds itself under attack from the Syndicalists. His Pro-German Sympathies however has made him unpopular with certain figures within the army, most notably Colonel Henri Guisan."
POLITICS_SWI_EMIL_SONDEREGGER_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 28, 1868 \nHerisau, Switzerland\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn as the son of a wealthy embroidery businessman, Sonderegger worked for the export branch of his father's company, travelling extensively and developing strong language skills as a result; eventually leaving the family business to follow a career in the Swiss Army, rising to artillery lieutenant by 1888.

SWI_abolish_the_verdingkinder_desc: "The Verdingkinder, or "Contract Children", are children taken from their loving families and sent to work as slaves for the benefit of fat capitalist corporations.

SWI_mandatory_service_desc: "It is not enough to simply draft the men in defence of Switzerland. The women, the children, the elderly. Our neighbours can field armies of millions, so we too must field an army of equal size to combat these threats."

SWI_one_people: "One Swiss People, One Swiss Language"
SWI_one_people_desc: "For too long have the Swiss people bent to the wills of our neighbours and spoken in their tongues. It is time for Switzerland to abandon these foreign languages and only conduct official business in the German language, the one true language of Switzerland."

SWI_consolidate_power: "Consolidate Governmental Power"
SWI_consolidate_power_desc: "There are dissenting voices still within the government and in the streets that oppose the takeover of the government by loyal nationalist forces.

SWI_fortress_defense_desc: "If our enemies are so keen to attack us in our homes, then we will make such a network of interconnected fortifications that the very idea of assaulting Switzerland will fill the enemy with dread, as the imagine the many millions it will take to gain even a single kilometre of our land."

SWI_executive_commander: "Modell der Unternehmensführung"
SWI_executive_commander_desc: "Sonderegger, ever the strong opponent of parliamentary democracy, likening it to the chaos of a stock exchange, has proposed a new, better system.

SWI_generation_of_generals_desc: "Ulrich Wille saved Switzerland from the fate which the French and English met; in the wake of the Savoyard Crisis, his son has pulled off the same feat Two generations of Generals have been responsible for Switzerland’s good fortune in fighting off Syndicalism, and for their efforts we are forever grateful.

Our most natural allies in Berlin, and seeing as it would be foolish not to seize on our shared ties, we shall formally petition the Kaiser to allow us into the German Sphere.

SWI_unity_through_conquest_desc: "It is not by hiding in our homes and bracing for the coming tides that we shall weather the storm. It is by taking what is and has always been rightfully ours.

SWI_french_mission: "Diplomatic Mission to the Commune"
SWI_french_mission_desc: "The source of the crisis in Haute-Savoie was our extremely sour relations with our large neighbour, the Commune of France.

#Syndicalist Path

SWI_bend_to_france: "Bend to France"

SWI_never_again_desc: "The Geneva Strikes of the early 1930s were caused by a failing and inefficient government. We have made steps to reform that government, but there are many who seek protections against such a tragedy ever occurring again. Thus the Syndicalist Unions are to be given their own military powers, so that the power rests solely in the hands of the Trade Unions."

SWI_workers_reform: "Reform Workers Rights"
SWI_workers_reform_desc: "Much of the violence in the recent history of our country have been driven by labour disputes. With a Syndicalist Government in Command we can begin reforming the government on the labourers line.

SWI_womens_suffrage: "Votes for Women"

SWI_new_national_council_desc: "With the Federal Council being dissolved some time ago, the time has come to decide on a new governing body for our nation.

SWI_the_peoples_republic: "Found the Helvetic Commune"
SWI_the_peoples_republic_desc: "The people of Switzerland have made their wills clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by a government too strong for its own good, and too disconnected from the people, wallowing in its capitalist greed. Thus a new government must be formed, a government run solely by the people, and for the people."

SWI_totalitarian_regime: "A Stronger Hand is Needed"
SWI_totalitarian_regime_desc: "The people of Switzerland have made their will clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by lack of protection from foreign influences.

SWI_bircher_plan_desc: "Colonel Eugen Bircher has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves pursuing a more traditional war with a larger army and a central, mobile force that would seek set-piece battles. Choosing this plan would commit the nation to fighting a war centred around a mobile army with as many offensive moves as defensive."

SWI_man_borders: "Activate the Border Guard"
SWI_man_borders_desc: "We must first activate the civilian Border Guard units and flood our outer defences with soldiers in a show of force against outside aggression. The Swiss people will flock in droves to our defence, and only the staunchest of foes would dare break themselves upon our walls."

SWI_ski_divisions: "Assemble the Ski Divisions"
SWI_ski_divisions_desc: "The Swiss Ski Divisions have a mastery of the Alpine terrain and should be moved into a single, cohesive unit capable of making a decisive strike against our enemies. Properly equipping and expanding these forces will give us a powerful tool to use in the fights to come."

SWI_mountineer_defense: "Active Defence"
SWI_mountineer_defense_desc: "The best defence is a good offence. It is not good enough to simply sit behind or lines. We must make active manoeuvres and strike at the enemy whenever we are given an opportunity, so that we may eventually drive him from our lands entirely."

SWI_integrate_militias: "Integrate the Militias"
SWI_integrate_militias_desc: "The true heroes of the Savoyard Crisis are the brave men of the anti-syndicalist militias. Their support helped us strengthen our nation, but it is now time to integrate the political militias into our armed forces, so they can fight for our great nation once again."

SWI_wille_plan_desc: "Despite holding a lower rank than his compatriots Guisan and Bircher-  Ulrich Wille Junior, son of our nation’s previous General has been promoted to the Swiss Army’s highest office. This promotion comes to the dismay of colonel Guisan, who has often been at the center of hostility with Corps Commander Wille, who sees Guisan as his main opponent. "

SWI_prussian_reorganization: "Reorganise the Army on Prussian Lines"
SWI_prussian_reorganization_desc: "Just like his father, the Junior Ulrich Wille holds outspoken pro-German views, and just like his father, has moved to reorganize the Swiss Armed Forces on the Prussian Model. To properly defend Switzerland against the French marauders, we must replicate the tactics of the army which has time and time again defeated the forces of France."

SWI_legacy_of_wille_sr: "Legacy of the Elder Ulrich Wille"
SWI_legacy_of_wille_sr_desc: "Throughout the first Weltkreig, Ulrich Wille Sr. kept our nation safe from Socialist forces - preventing our noble Helvetica from falling victim to Syndicalist like our neighbors to the west. The defensive spirit espoused by Wille will be replicated once more to effectively utilize the Swiss Defensive Spirit against our foreign and domestic foes."

SWI_deploy_soldiers: "Soldiers on the Streets"
SWI_deploy_soldiers_desc: "Revolutionaries threaten Switzerland at every turn, with Socialists enveloping us at every angle and domestic rabble rousers actively conspiring with the enemy; to defend ourselves drastic action must be taken. On the orders of General Wille the Swiss Armed Forces will be deployed in major hotbeds of Syndicalist Action, preventing Syndicalism from taking hold, all while patching major holes in Switzerland’s defensive network."

#Guisan

SWI_guisan_plan: "The Guisan Plan"
SWI_guisan_plan_desc: "Colonel Henri Guisan has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves a stoic defence and continued usage of the pre-prepared fallback lines and fortresses that would ensure a campaign of guerrilla warfare throughout our nation. Accepting his plan would mean moving forward with a plan to fight a purely defensive war."

SWI_guisan_speech: "The Rütlirapport"

SWI_old_generals: "Dealing with the Generals"
SWI_old_generals_desc: "While the vast majority of the 'Old Guard' has fled to Germany, some loyal officers still remain. However, letting them lead our armies may alienate those who fought for the revolution."

SWI_new_officers: "Rebuilding our Officer Corps"

SWI_swiss_guard: "Expand the Swiss Guard"
SWI_swiss_guard_desc: "Long since a fixture of the Holy See, our newfound relationship with the Italy has given us opportunity to expand the Papal Guard with experienced and veteran soldiers. Sending these soldiers to the Pope's aid will serve as a fine gesture of goodwill and thanks for standing by us in our time of need."

SWI_strategic_services: "Found the Military Intelligence Service"
SWI_strategic_services_desc: "As a small nation in the centre of Europe, we cannot hope to win on strength alone. We must found a new intelligence service that can solve our problems before they can snowball out of control, and give us powerful intelligence on the moves of our enemies."

SWI_electronics_research: "NEMA Modell 45"
SWI_electronics_research_desc: "Developed as a replacement for the ageing German ciphers used by the Swiss Army prior to the Second Weltkrieg, the NEMA represents the nation's interests in ensuring that no other nation no matter how friendly, can read our mail."

SWI_swiss_miracle: "The Swiss Miracle"
SWI_swiss_miracle_desc: "A combination of strong economic policies, a healthy bank stocked with gold, and a dash of luck have combined to birth an economic boom the likes of which Switzerland has never seen. Dubbed "The Swiss Miracle", this spurt of economic growth is exactly what we need to advance our place in the world's hierarchy."

SWI_nuclear_program: "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy"
SWI_nuclear_program_desc: "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy's purpose is to investigate the use of both nuclear power in providing for our nation's energy needs, and to evaluate the requirements for the advancement of a weaponised nuclear programme for the defence of the nation."

SWI_uranium_mine: "The Schmutzli Project"
SWI_uranium_mine_desc: "Switzerland is a small state compared to the titans of Europe. Thus we find it necessary to defend ourselves with all means available to us, even if we must bathe the continent in nuclear fire to achieve our goals."

SWI_expand_our_operations: "Expand our Intelligence Operations"
SWI_expand_our_operations_desc: "With the world falling to chaos, the Military Intelligence Service must be called upon again and again to undertake more dangerous and more dubious tasks to defend the nation. Expanding their areas of influence and operational capacities will help them resolve whatever problem comes their way. No matter how unsavoury."

SWI_motorization: "Transition to a Motorised Force"
SWI_motorization_desc: "Our military is almost entirely composed of foot infantry and horse-drawn support. Our troops are slow to move and our supplies even slower to arrive. It is important that we invest in motorisation to keep our troops from fighting the next war with the last war's equipment."

SWI_armor_experiments: "Invest in the Nahkampfkanone"
SWI_armor_experiments_desc: "The Nahkampfkanone, an experimental Swiss AT Destroyer, has shown great promise in its initial field tests. This project has shown that we are capable of designing our own armoured vehicles, and that we should continue to invest in similar projects."

SWI_mechanized: "Panzergrenadiers"
SWI_mechanized_desc: "Our initial motorisation efforts have proved most successful, but there is still more to do. In Germany, new mechanised Panzergrenadiers have begun to show promise as the fighting force of the future, and it is only wise that we follow in their footsteps and invest in our own mechanised forces."

SWI_defensive_constructions: "New Defensive Fortifications"
SWI_defensive_constructions_desc: "Our previous projects have given us extensive experience and knowledge in the proper construction and design of fortifications. We can take advantage of this knowledge and create new defensive networks wherever they are needed."

#Economic Tree

SWI_national_bank: "Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks"
SWI_national_bank_desc: "The Swiss National Bank is the strong economic arm of the entire country, handling the finances of the vast majority of the population and the government alike. Subsidising and assisting the bank in its operations, and allowing for bank secrecy when dealing with account holder funds, will serve to boost the economy as we recover from the Black Monday disaster."

SWI_new_roadways: "Electrify the Railways"
SWI_new_roadways_desc: "Our nation is one with twisting roadways and extensive railways that connect cities separated by large mountain ranges. It is important that we update and maintain our extensive rail networks so that we may move goods and soldiers around the nation as easily as possible. Electrifying tour rail lines with power from our hydroelectric dams will ensure they run as efficiently as possible."

SWI_develop_cantons: "National Canton Development Initiative"
SWI_develop_cantons_desc: "We must make a concerted effort to develop all regions of the nation equally. To this end, we must allow the Cantons autonomy in their own development and construction of infrastructure, as well as to empower the Bureau of Mining of the Federal War, Industry and Employment Office to create a national survey of the nation's natural resources for exploitation."

SWI_canton_improvement: "Subsidise Swiss Steel"
SWI_canton_improvement_desc: "Switzerland is a nation with few national resources of its own. Swiss Steel is one of the few Steel corporations operating inside of the country. If Switzerland is to become self-sufficient in Steel production, we will need to fund their efforts."

SWI_swiss_seas: "Swiss on the High Seas"
SWI_swiss_seas_desc: "Switzerland is a traditionally landlocked nation with no direct access to the high seas, however, this does not prevent us from fielding a fleet of our own. Whether it is a militarised navy or one of maritime commerce, the Swiss will sail the seas as proud as any other nation on earth."

SWI_military_factories: "Subsidise Oerlikon-Bührle"
SWI_military_factories_desc: "Oerlikon-Bührle is the largest producer of arms and artillery in the nation. Their weapons constitute almost half of our nations arms exports, and giving them valued government subsidies will not only increase their productivity but ensure our soldiers are equipped with the highest quality weapons."

SWI_final_factories: "The Swiss War Economy"
SWI_final_factories_desc: "The war is becoming a large drain on our stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Our trade with foreign powers is not only insufficient, but unreliable. We must transition not only our industrial quarters but all parts of our society to a war footing if we are to produce enough weapons to last the conflict."

SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels: "The Trans-Alpine Railway Tunnels"
SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels_desc: "The tunnels running beneath the Alps form a powerful economic lifeline that cross through the centre of Europe. Expanding these tunnels will increase our ability to profit from our control of these railways."

SWI_promote_franc: "Promote the Swiss Franc"
SWI_promote_franc_desc: "The economic systems of our neighbours have seen disastrous free falls in the wake of Black Monday. This has affected the strengths of their currencies, and confidence in the financial markets has fallen. Promoting the Swiss franc as the viable alternative to the failing German mark will serve to boost our own economy in the face of this economic crisis."

SWI_sell_war_bonds: "Sell Wehr Bonds"
SWI_sell_war_bonds_desc: "Promotion of the Swiss Franc has begun boosting our economy, but the government is still heavily in debt. We must turn to the people in order to support the government in the face of war."

SWI_new_fighters: "New Fighters"

SWI_war_profiteering: "War Profiteering"
SWI_war_profiteering_desc: "Our neighbour's losses are our gains. Selling weapons to our neighbours as they kill each other in senseless conflict can only serve to strengthen our own position when the time comes to fight."

SWI_economic_sufficiency: "Striving for Economic Self-Sufficiency"
SWI_economic_sufficiency_desc: "All aspects of the Swiss economy rely heavily on foreign imports in order to survive. We must work to move as many industries as possible inside of our own borders to reduce our reliance on foreign powers and encourage our economy to rely on internal sources for production."

SWI_cultivation_battle: "Winning the Cultivation Battle"
SWI_cultivation_battle_desc: "Switzerland is not a nation blessed with an abundance of natural resources. For centuries Swiss farmers have fought a battle against the harsh mountain climates to grow enough crops to feed the nation. Now that war looms on the horizon, we must subsidise these farmers to make Switzerland self-sufficient."

SWI_expanding_the_shipyards: "Expand the Shipyards"
SWI_expanding_the_shipyards_desc: "Our military adventures have found us currently in possession of several large shipyards. Theses shipyards, the first in our nation's history, could be used to produce the large blue water navy that the Swiss people have only ever dreamed of."

SWI_merchant_marine: "Focus on the Merchant Marine"
SWI_merchant_marine_desc: "Investing into a strong military navy would be a waste. By the time hostilities have ended, our navy will still be in its infancy. Meanwhile, we could instead use this time to invest heavily into our merchant marine, whose voyages could directly impact our international trade and bring back tidy profits."

SWI_military_navy: "Focus on a Militarised Navy"
SWI_military_navy_desc: "Rather than wasting our time focusing on trade, we should instead use our new naval facilities to facilitate the creation of a completely new Swiss Navy, one which can fight the navies of the other world powers."

SWI_seaborne_trade_routes: "Expanding into Seaborne Trade"
SWI_seaborne_trade_routes_desc: "The Swiss economy is on an upswing that will last it for years to come. Now that we have sea access, it is our best interests to keep this momentum and begin investing into nautical trade routes to expand our wealth."

SWI_independent_navy: "Brown Water to Blue Water Navy"
SWI_independent_navy_desc: "The Lakes Flotilla of Switzerland now finds itself in possession of all of the facilities and materiel necessary to form a proper naval force. This newly created Swiss Navy must quickly adapt itself to combat on the high seas, or be sunk in the process."

SWI_naval_bombers: "Naval Bomber Development"
SWI_naval_bombers_desc: "A combination of research into traditional bomber forces and naval innovations, the new Swiss naval bombers will drastically increase our ability to project power across the waves."

SWI_coastal_defense: "Expand the Lakes Flotilla"
SWI_coastal_defense_desc: "While we move forward with our transition to a fully blue water navy, it is still of vital importance that we support the Lakes Flotilla, for they protect the waterways in and around Switzerland from outside aggression."

SWI_naval_officers: "Naval Officer Training"
SWI_naval_officers_desc: "Switzerland's naval activities in previous years has consisted only of merchant marine sailors and the brown water Lakes Flotilla. We must take these few experienced men we can, and use them to train the next generation of proud Swiss sailors for our navy."

SWI_ship_designs: "Swiss Ship Designs"
SWI_ship_designs_desc: "While we have come into the possession of new naval facilities, a first for this formerly landlocked state, we cannot move forward with a fleet without first investing in ship designs. Switzerland's naval tradition is small, and thus we must move forward to design a new fleet of ships as soon as possible to begin our training."

SWI_first_vessel: "Christening the EKS Helvetia"
SWI_first_vessel_desc: "After several gruelling months of work, it is time for great celebration as the Swiss Navy officially christens its first ocean going naval vessel. The EKS Helvetia is the first of many in the new Swiss Fleet, and will serve as our first flagship as the Swiss Navy joins the great oceangoing fleets of this age."

SWI_beneath_the_waves: "Swiss Beneath the Waves"
SWI_beneath_the_waves_desc: "While we have found ourselves in possession of large naval facilities and dockyards, it is not feasible to create a large traditional fleet. Instead we should focus on cheap and efficient submarines, so that we can project power without the decades-long investments a surface fleet requires."

SWI_surface_fleet: "The Landlocked Fleet"
SWI_surface_fleet_desc: "Our nation was formerly a landlocked state, one that could not properly project its power on the high seas. Now we find ourselves in the possession of multiple dockyards, and as an ascendant naval power. It is our duty to create a surface fleet that can go toe-to-toe with the old powers."

# Air Tree

SWI_mountain_airfields: "Alpine Airfields"

SWI_air_academy: "Nationalise SwissAir"
SWI_air_academy_desc: "Our air force is lacking in trained pilots and serviceable planes. In light of this crisis, we must take advantage of every possible plane we can get our hands on. One proposition is to nationalise all civilian planes and recruit their pilots, mechanics, and radiomen into our own air force."

SWI_cross_the_border: "Airborne Border Raids"
SWI_cross_the_border_desc: "We should look to use our air force not only as a defensive force, but also as a force capable of striking deep into enemy territory. Performing these cross-border raids into enemy territory will let our enemies know that we are capable of more than simple defensive actions."

SWI_mountain_aa: "Camouflaged Anti-Air Emplacements"
SWI_mountain_aa_desc: "The mountainous terrain of the Alps creates a multitude of areas where we can create new defensive AA emplacements to defend our skies. Such a network of emplaced defences will make any air force rethink their plans to invade our airspace."

SWI_new_swiss_army: "The New Swiss Army"
SWI_new_swiss_army_desc: "Through reform and new military leadership, the Swiss Army of today is all but unrecognisable compared to the army that marched in drill but a few short years ago. This new army is tough, veteran, and ready to take on the world."

SWI_free_our_skies: "Free our Skies"

SWI_luftwaffe: "The Schweizer Luftwaffe"
SWI_luftwaffe_desc: "The Swiss Air Force has not seen a major change in composition since the end of the Weltkrieg. Our planes are old and decrepit, and in drastic need of an overhaul. We must begin an immediate modernisation of our air force so as not to be left behind."

SWI_new_academy: "Reform the Pilot Schools"
SWI_new_academy_desc: "In the interwar period, our fighters relied on an informal school of training that involved local instructors and wildly differing levels of competence.

SWI_new_tactics: "Bambini-Code"
SWI_new_tactics_desc: "Bambini-Code is a brevity code recently developed to allow for easy communication between our fighter squadrons in the heat of combat.

SWI_strategic_bombing: "Strategic Bombing Initiatives"
SWI_strategic_bombing_desc: "The acceleration of our previous raiding campaigns have taught us that if we are to continue, we must invest in large strategic bombing forces. These forces will allow us to project our power across the continent while maintaining our air force entirely within the confines of Switzerland."

SWI_liscense_foregin_designs: "Licence Foreign Designs"
SWI_liscense_foregin_designs_desc: "Foreign aircraft have proven to be deadly and effective in recent wars. Our own aircraft industry is in its infancy. Perhaps the best idea is to instead licence foreign designs rather than having to spend valuable resources researching our own Swiss aircraft."

### Events ###
swiss.1.t: "Guisan's Speech"
swiss.1.d: "It was a wonderful sunny day when Henri Guisan made his speech not only to all of the soldiers and officers in attendance, but to the whole of Switzerland. In his speech he praised the strength and unity of the Swiss people, and promised that victory was not only attainable, but assured.\nAs Guisan finished giving his lengthy and beautifully worded speech, he was greeted with thunderous applause from all in attendance. This will surely go down in Swiss history as a historic event."
swiss.1.a: "Inspirational to us all."

swiss.2.t: "Gathering the Army"
swiss.2.d: "Switzerland has maintained its neutrality in conflict for hundreds of years. We are a people that hold fast to our values of neutrality and peace. But now we find ourselves embroiled in a conflict for our very survival. The men are scared and many are unsure if they are capable of fighting at all. Seeing this weakness among the soldiers, Henri Guisan has decided to hold a large rally on the Rütli, the historic location of the Rütlischwur of 1291. All Swiss officers are to be in attendance, and the speech is to be made to inspire Swiss people across the nation."
swiss.2.a: "We await Guisan's speech."

swiss.3.t: "Referendum: Official Languages"
swiss.3.d: "Enough political capital has been raised to institute an official referendum today on an important topic to the Swiss people. The issue of whether or not to include Romansch as a national language of Switzerland is what is to be decided. If voted in, this predominantly Swiss language would join the likes of French, German, and Italian among Switzerland's national languages. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.3.a: "No Campaigning."
swiss.3.b: "Limited Campaigning."
swiss.3.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
swiss.3.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

swiss.5.t: "The Language Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.5.d: "The referendum has succeeded, and Romansch is now officially a national language of Switzerland."
swiss.5.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.6.t: "The Language Referendum Fails"
swiss.6.d: "Despite our best efforts, the referendum has been defeated. Romash will not become a national language."
swiss.6.a: "The people did not support it."

swiss.7.t: "Referendum: The National Protection Act"
swiss.7.d: "There has been increasing support recently for increasing powers of the state to arrest and detain subversive actors in the nation with increased authority. This move is seen as necessary by many who have seen the escalating rift between French West and German East inside of the country, and believe that many extremist movements, on the right and left, are forming an increasingly large threat to the stability of the nation. Many opponents believe that it will only be a stopgap measure, and that a conflict between the government and extremist movements is inevitable. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.7.a: "No Campaigning."
swiss.7.b: "Limited Campaigning."
swiss.7.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
swiss.7.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

swiss.9.t: "The National Protection Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.9.d: "The referendum has succeeded, and state forces have been given greater freedoms in their ability to combat extremist threats to the stability of the nation."
swiss.9.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.10.t: "The National Protection Referendum Fails"
swiss.10.d: "It seems that the people are not yet ready for an increase in state power. They have voted down the referendum and the powers of the police will remain unchanged."
swiss.10.a: "The people did not support it."

swiss.11.t: "Referendum: Combat the Economic Crisis"
swiss.11.d: "The recent disaster that was Black Monday has thrown the nation's economy into a dangerous downward spiral. There are actions that the government can, and will, take to combat this crisis, but this referendum is to decide whether the government can take extraordinary action outside of its usual power in order to resolve the crisis swiftly. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.11.a: "No Campaigning."
swiss.11.b: "Limited Campaigning."
swiss.11.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
swiss.11.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

swiss.13.t: "The Economic Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.13.d: "The economic referendum has succeeded, and the government now has free reign to solve the Black Monday crisis with its new extraordinary powers."
swiss.13.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.14.t: "The Economic Referendum Fails"
swiss.14.d: "It seems that the people do not believe that the government needs extra authority to solve the crisis. What does this mean for our economy?"
swiss.14.a: "The people did not support it."

swiss.15.t: "Referendum: Ban Syndicalist Unions"
swiss.15.d: "It is no secret that Syndicalism has been spreading constantly over recent years inside of the nation. It shares a large border with the Syndicalist Commune of France, and the pains of the Geneva Massacre still fester in Romandie. This referendum is an extreme measure to combat this crisis at the root, and ban the Syndicalist Unions from the nation entirely. This move is sure to be controversial, especially with the French Commune. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.15.a: "No Campaigning."
swiss.15.b: "Limited Campaigning."
swiss.15.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
swiss.15.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

swiss.17.t: "The Syndicalist Union Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.17.d: "Despite strong Syndicalist support is the Western regions of Switzerland, the referendum has succeeded. All existing Syndicalist Trade Unions are now dissolved and none are legally allowed to form again. This is sure to raise the ire of the French."
swiss.17.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.18.t: "The Syndicalist Union Referendum Fails"
swiss.18.d: "It seems that Syndicalist support was too strong, and the referendum has failed. Syndicalists will continue to meet as they have done over the past few years."
swiss.18.a: "The people did not support it."

swiss.19.t: "Referendum: Reorganise the Army"
swiss.19.d: "It has become clear that the old structure of the Swiss army is no longer fit for the coming years. Previously, the military has relied on a strong reserve of quickly-trained volunteers in order to form the backbone of the army when in need, but the rise of strong professional armies all around Switzerland has made this model seem obsolete. This referendum proposes that we reform the army along the German model, and create a strong and professional standing force. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.19.a: "No Campaigning."
swiss.19.b: "Limited Campaigning."
swiss.19.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
swiss.19.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

swiss.21.t: "The Army Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.21.d: "The army referendum has succeeded, and reforms are to begin immediately within the ranks of our armed forces."
swiss.21.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.22.t: "The Army Referendum Fails"
swiss.22.d: "The people have struck down our proposed reforms to the army. The army will continue to be formed from reserve troops for the foreseeable future."
swiss.22.a: "The people did not support it."

swiss.23.t: "Referendum: The Status of Freemasonry"
swiss.23.d: "Freemasonry has come into the public spotlight recently for its supposed connection to dangerous extremist movements and the prevalence of its members among higher levels of office. Freemasons are not believed by the state to be a real danger, but who really knows with such secretive societies? The public will have to say whether they are allowed to continue their practice within our borders. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.23.a: "No Campaigning."
swiss.23.b: "Limited Campaigning."
swiss.23.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
swiss.23.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

swiss.25.t: "The Freemasonry Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.25.d: "The referendum has passed, and Freemasons have been barred from official meetings inside the nation. While there is likely little effect on the day-to-day of the government's operation, the public's support of the state has risen with the news."
swiss.25.a: "Wonderful!"
swiss.26.t: "The Freemasonry Referendum Fails"
swiss.26.d: "The referendum to ban Freemasonry from Switzerland has failed. Is this the influence of the Freemasons at work?"
swiss.26.a: "The people did not support it."

swiss.27.t: "Referendum: On the Transport of Goods"
swiss.27.d: "The referendum of the day has to do with the current system of transport of goods along Swiss roadways. The proposed referendum would change how these goods are to be moved, and would potentially increase the overall volume of trade along major roadways. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.27.a: "No Campaigning."
swiss.27.b: "Limited Campaigning."
swiss.27.c: "Moderate Campaigning."
swiss.27.e: "Extensive Campaigning."

swiss.29.t: "The Transportation Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.29.d: "The referendum on the transportation of goods has succeeded, and our economy is likely to get a small boost from this."
swiss.29.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.30.t: "The Transportation Referendum Fails"
swiss.30.d: "The referendum on the transport of goods has failed. The roads will remain unchanged, for now."
swiss.30.a: "The people did not support it."

swiss.31.t: "Referendum: Abolish the Federal Government"
swiss.31.d: "There is a heavy atmosphere over the crowds today as the nation moves forward with a referendum to abolish the current federal government, and invite the leading representatives from the nation's strongest Trade Unions to draft the foundation of a new government. French "allied" military personnel and observers are seen in full force throughout important civilian centres, and many know that a vote against the change is fruitless. The old Swiss government is no more."
swiss.31.a: "Is this truly a fair vote?"

swiss.33.t: "The Government Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.33.d: "It was truly a bizarre sight, as bands played bombastic tunes and parades were held to mostly unenthusiastic crowds in the wake of the referendum's success. The new Swiss government is to be formed shortly, but many in the conservative German East of the nation find nothing to celebrate."
swiss.33.a: "As if there was any doubt."

swiss.34.t: "Switzerland Seeks to Join the Internationale"
swiss.34.d: "After the recent Syndicalist revolution rocked our small eastern neighbour, many assumed it would only be a matter of time before they joined the Third Internationale. Today is that day, as Swiss diplomats have officially requested that the nation be allowed into our alliance."
swiss.34.a: "Of course!"
swiss.34.b: "We don't need them."

swiss.35.t: "The French have Accepted"
swiss.35.d: "After our formal request to join the Third Internationale, the French have responded positively, accepting us into the alliance."
swiss.35.a: "Our brothers!"

swiss.36.t: "Our Membership has been Declined"
swiss.36.d: "Despite the fact that we share ideological similarities as well as a land border, the French have refused to accept us into their international alliance. For what reason could they have they done this?"
swiss.36.a: "Impossible!"

swiss.37.t: "Switzerland Seeks Protection"
swiss.37.d: "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to join our military alliance. How should we respond?"
swiss.37.a: "They made a wise decision."
swiss.37.b: "They would only drag us down."

swiss.38.t: "We Stand with Germany"
swiss.38.d: "Our diplomat to Berlin has sent news that Germany has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance and welcomed us with open arms. We are now a proper member state of the Reichspakt."
swiss.38.a: "Our future is bright."

swiss.39.t: "Germany has Ignored Us!"
swiss.39.d: "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Germany with regards to our acceptance into the Reichspakt. It seems that the Germans are keen on keeping us out of their alliance."
swiss.39.a: "But why?"

swiss.40.t: "Military Coup"
swiss.40.d: "Before dawn broke over the governmental offices in the capital, it was already over. Rouge Officers, aided by the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband and the Volksfront: populist movements that held large influence over governmental affairs through their extensive membership in both the military and high government offices, had moved in the earliest hours of the morning to secure all necessary locations to ensure a successful coup. Hand-picked military units held important locations throughout the capital and the rest of the nation, and not a single shot was fired, nor a single life lost.\n\nThe previous government's failure to both protect the Swiss people in Romandie and secure foreign assistance against such a move had made it obvious to officers that the current government has failed completely, and only an entirely new government could hope to revitalize the Swiss nation.\n\nOne only hopes that their nationalistic tendencies can be kept in check."
swiss.40.a: "Switzerland needs no allies."

swiss.401.t: "Formalising the Military State"
swiss.401.d: "The Swiss Federal Council was dissolved in the opening of the Military Coup - with most major politicians on the council being placed under arrest on the orders of the military. The Federal Council was replaced with a committee of officers dedicated to protecting Switzerland, with the promise that the Committee would be dissolved as soon as Switzerland was secured against all threats. However now that the Army has solidified its control over the Swiss State, it has become clear that the promises of a return to normality were nothing more than a lie. The Military Junta is here to stay, and soon the Swiss Security Council will be made a thing of the past as one figure rises to paramount of Switzerland."
swiss.401.a: "A New Switzerland Rises."

swiss.402.t: "The Face of the New Dictatorship"
swiss.402.d: "With the need for a Military Council having undoubtedly past, the time for Switzerland to choose a new leader has come. The previous failures to protect our citizens from tyranny had come from the weakness of our government; with the previous government being abolished the opportunity for Switzerland to proclaim a strong centralized government has presented itself. No longer will Switzerland be a slave to its Cantons!\n\n The choices for leadership are as follows: The outspoken Germanophile and son of former general Ulrich Wille Jr., the physician and leader of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband Eugen Bircher, and the militarist and outspoken right-wing demagogue Emil Sonderegger. These three figures were the core of the officer group which saved Switzerland from its own government, however certain other figures have put forward the immensely popular Henri Guisan as a potential leader. Such a figure could lend credibility to our government, however some worry about his pro-democracy stances."
swiss.402.a: "Ulrich Wille Jr."
swiss.402.b: "Eugen Bircher."
swiss.402.c: "Emil Sonderegger."
swiss.402.e: "Henri Guisan."

swiss.403.t: "The Restoration of Democracy"
swiss.403.d: "The suspicions of officers within the government who distrust Guisan have been proven correct. Several of the most radical officers involved in the plotting of the coup have been placed under arrest, and General Guisan has announced the restoration of Democratic Elections, with the Swiss Federal Council to be restored in a months time. This marks the end of one of the darkest chapters in Swiss History, as we return to what Switzerland was before the coup; a democratic and neutral nation founded on the principles of mutual respect and self determination "
swiss.403.a: "Three Cheers for Guisan the Liberator!"

swiss.404.t: "Sonderegger Consolidates Control"
swiss.404.d: "The announcement of the abolition of the Federal Government and the illegalization of all political parties came in the morning; by the late afternoon Sonderegger had completely secured his control over the newly proclaimed Swiss State. Officers who refused to pledge loyalty were dragged away, and the new loyal officer corps threw their complete support behind their new leader. The announcement of Sonderegger coming to lead was followed by the creation of the new title of ‘Chief Commander’ - a position that occupies the position of head of state and head of government. The failure of the Federal Council has proven to us the need for a strong leader; a need which Sonderegger is happy to meet."
swiss.404.a: "The saviour of the Fatherland!"

swiss.405.t: "Bircher Consolidates Control"
swiss.405.d: "The announcement of the abolition of the Federal Government and the illegalization of all political parties came in the morning; by the late afternoon Bircher had completely secured his control over the newly proclaimed Swiss State. Officers who refused to pledge loyalty were dragged away, and the new loyal officer corps threw their complete support behind their new leader. The announcement of Bircher coming to lead was followed by the creation of the new title of ‘Chief Commander’ - a position that occupies the position of head of state and head of government. The failure of the Federal Council has proven to us the need for a strong leader; a need which Sonderegger is happy to meet."
swiss.405.a: "The saviour of the Fatherland!"

swiss.406.t: "Wille Consolidates Control"
swiss.406.d: "The announcement of the abolition of the Federal Government and the illegalization of all political parties came in the morning; by the late afternoon Wille had completely secured his control over the newly proclaimed Swiss State. Officers who refused to pledge loyalty were dragged away, and the new loyal officer corps threw their complete support behind their new leader. The announcement of Wille coming to lead was followed by the creation of the new title of ‘Chief Commander’ - a position that occupies the position of head of state and head of government. The failure of the Federal Council has proven to us the need for a strong leader; a need which Wille is happy to meet."
swiss.406.a: "The saviour of the Fatherland!"

swiss.407.t: "Death of Emil Sonderegger"
swiss.407.d: "Our Chief, Emil Sonderegger has passed away after a lengthy battle with cancer. With a power vacuum rapidly emerging, the question of who will lead Switzerland permeates within the Swiss Officer Corps. Generals Eugen Bircher and Ulrich Wille Jr. have both presented themselves as potential successors, and despite their initial opposition to Sonderegger, their integration into the new nationalist regime make them likely successors to the late Sonderegger; even if some fear that they might dismantle the state which Sonderegger built. Alternatively, Dr. Max Leo Keller, one of Sonderegger’s ministers and leader of the National Front group has presented themselves as a potential leader, however several army officers are skeptical of the prospect of a non-soldier commanding the Swiss State. "
swiss.407.d_2: "Influential commander within the Swiss Army Emil Sonderegger has passed away today after a long battle with cancer. Active in far right circles, his death is celebrated by several socialist figures who reveal his role in the suppression of the Zurich General Strike. "
swiss.407.a: "Colonel Bircher will succeed the Chief."
swiss.407.b: "Commander Wille Jr. will succeed the Chief."
swiss.407.c: "Dr. Keller will protect the Fatherland!"
swiss.407.e: "Rest in Peace?"

swiss.408.t: "Suggestions for a Stronger State"
swiss.408.d: "With the restoration of the Swiss Democratic Process imminent, many have suggested to General Guisan the prospect of radically shifting the system of governance that has existed since our nation’s founding. No shortage of officers point to the weakness of the central government as being responsible for the failures of Savoy, and have suggested abolishing or otherwise weakening the Federal Council and instituting a singular Federal President to guide our nation. These proposals are controversial, though not without merit considering the extraordinary situation Switzerland finds itself in."
swiss.408.a: "Nonsense, the Swiss System shall be restored just as it was!"
swiss.408.b: "Perhaps they have a point... "

swiss.41.t: "The State of Switzerland"
swiss.41.d: "The Swiss Confederation saw crisis in 19th century. In several cantons liberal powers prevailed, calling for more democracy and more centralism. This met the opposition of the catholic, conservatively dominated cantons who formed the Sonderbund in 1845. The Sonderbund War erupted in 1847 which saw the liberals as victors. In 1848 a Federal Constitution was ratified, turning the loose league of cantons into a federal state with a new federal capital in Bern. The new constitution created new institutions like the Bundesrat (Federal Council), Bundesversammlung (Federal Assembly), and Bundesgericht (Federal Court). Switzerland remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg, although there were various domestic conflicts between German and French speaking Swiss citizens. In addition economic problems arose, completely surrounded as the country was by warring nations. The radical left gained a lot of support during that time, and in 1919 a strike in Geneva called for by the workers movement attempted to push through major social changes. The attempt failed because of the fear of spreading of French syndicalism and its subsequent repression by Swiss government, but in its wake social reforms were begun, bringing about higher wages and shorter work days. In 1919 the system of proportional representation was introduced. The conservative Freisinnige lost their majority while the social democrats grew stronger. Into the 1930s domestic politics were governed in response to the conflict between social democrats and conservatives. The struggles between communities in Switzerland are now taking more political values: French-speakers are more socialist, Germans more conservative and Italians more clerical. Will the rising belligerence in Europe have consequences on the neutral Confederation?"
swiss.41.a: "Onwards!"

swiss.42.t: "Expand the Swiss Guard"
swiss.42.d: "With our fates intertwined with those of the Swiss after our most recent diplomatic developments, our Swiss allies have made an interesting proposition. The Swiss Guard, a longstanding traditional guard of the pope, is to be expanded heavily and continuously supported by the current Swiss government. This increase in manpower will make the Swiss Guard a proper military force, and is obviously a sign of goodwill from our friends in Switzerland."
swiss.42.a: "To our friendship."

swiss.43.t: "Switzerland Calls for Aid!"
swiss.43.d: "Switzerland, the small mountain nation in the centre of Europe, has sent out a moving plea for assistance against the imperialistic actions of the French Commune. As we are one of the major powers of the world, accepting would show our support against French imperialism. Should we help the Swiss in their moment of need?"
swiss.43.notfrance: "Switzerland, the small mountain nation in the centre of Europe, has sent out a moving plea for assistance in their ongoing war. Switzerland is a small country with few resources, and it unlikely to win the war on their own without international assistance. As we are one of the major powers of the world, accepting would show our support against French imperialism. Should we help the Swiss in their moment of need?"
swiss.43.a: "And we will answer!"
swiss.43.b: "They are on their own."
swiss.43.c: "We have our own war to fight."

swiss.44.t: "Foreign Aid Arrives"
swiss.44.d: "A foreign power has responded to our call for aid by sending supplies and materiel for our defensive efforts. We owe them a great deal for their support."
swiss.44.a: "The support is much needed."

swiss.45.t: "Black Monday hits Switzerland"
swiss.45.d: "The recent run on the Berlin Stock Exchange is not without consequences for Switzerland. The Swiss economy relies heavily on German trading and the collapse of the German markets has sent immediate shock-waves through the Swiss economy. We must act if we are to save our economy from total collapse."
swiss.45.a: "The horror!"

swiss.46.t: "Switzerland joins the Vienna Circle"
swiss.46.d: "Responding to our calls for Europe's best and brightest to join our research initiative in Vienna, our friends the Swiss have responded favourably and have sent a handful of researchers to contribute to our initiative. Together we will make great discoveries in the name of scientific advancement."
swiss.46.a: "Fantastic."

swiss.47.t: "Switzerland joins the Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
swiss.47.d: "Compounding on our newfound influence in our southern neighbour Switzerland, Swiss scientists have begun to move to take part in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. These scientists will join our own research efforts and will hopefully create new opportunities for both our nations."
swiss.47.a: "Fantastic."

swiss.48.t: "The Foundation of the Helvetic Commune"
swiss.48.d: "Emotions were largely muted at the official signing of the papers that would make the new Helvetic Commune the official government in Switzerland, cementing the power of Syndicalism in governmental structure for the foreseeable future. Drawing on inspiration from the Helvetic Republic of old, the new Directorate promises to lead the Swiss people in a fashion that will benefit all Swiss people, and uphold their values for decades to come."
swiss.48.a: "A new dawn awaits!"

swiss.49.t: "The Birth of the Helvetic Commune"
swiss.49.d: "Thunderous applause from the steps of the capital building as Georges Oltramare was sworn in as the first and sole Director of the new Helvetic Commune. Rising to prominence on a wave of popularity due to his advocacy of the "Strong Hand" approach to revitalising Switzerland, the new Director has made promises that the mistakes of old will not be repeated, and that the new Helvetic Commune will stand tall as a proper pwer in Europe."
swiss.49.a: "Georges Oltramare is our future!"

swiss.50.t: "A New Official Capital?"
swiss.50.d: "With the foundation of a new government and a new future for Switzerland, a motion has been put forward to move the nation's official capital from its old seat in Bern to a more appropriate location in Geneva. The Genenva Council of State has been handling the government's duties effectively so far, and Geneva has long been the centre of Syndicalist movements in Switzerland. Many feel that this move would cement Switzerland's future as a proper Syndicalist nation. What should we do?"
swiss.50.a: "The capital will move to Geneva."
swiss.50.b: "The capital will stay in Bern."

swiss.51.t: "The [GetYear] Swiss Federal Elections"
swiss.51.d: "The time has come again for the people of Switzerland to vote, and decide which party will seize the majority in the National Council. Only one party can come out on top, which will it be?"
swiss.51.a: "Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz!"
swiss.51.b: "Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei - Demokraten!"
swiss.51.c: "Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei - Liberale!"
swiss.51.e: "Katholisch-Konservative Partei der Schweiz!"
swiss.51.f: "Bauern-, Gewerbe- und Bürgerpartei!"

swiss.52.t: "Looking for Foreign Assistance"
swiss.52.d: "With the French bearing down upon us, we must look to our neighbours for assistance in the defence of Switzerland. Facing down the might of the French Commune is no easy task, and it is unlikely that we will be defended, but we must try all the same."
swiss.52.a: "Look to Germany for aid."
swiss.52.b: "The powers of the world have their own struggles."
swiss.52.c: "The Austrians are no friends of the French."

swiss.54.t: "Switzerland Calls for Austrian Aid"
swiss.54.d: "Earlier today envoys from Switzerland arrived to plead for Austrian backing against French threats to seize the Romandie region. While we have little to gain from supporting such a venture, throwing our support behind the Swiss cause could boost our prestige worldwide and show the French that the Austrian Empire is not to be trifled with. Backing the Swiss in such a manner would certainly place them in our debt..."
swiss.54.a: "We will back the Swiss in this conflict."
swiss.54.b: "We really have nothing to gain from this."
swiss.55.b: "Then we shall crush them both!"

swiss.56.t: "The Austrian Empire Stands with Switzerland"
swiss.56.d: "In response to the brewing conflicts in Romandie and Haute-Savoie, the Austrian Empire has officially declared its support of the Swiss people against us. If we are to continue forward with our demands against the Swiss, it could result in a conflict of arms against Austria. The Austrians are a power to be reckoned with, can we afford a war so early?"
swiss.56.a: "The Austrians are not to be trifled with."
swiss.56.b: "It is time we show them who is the true power in Europe."

swiss.58.t: "Austria Remains Neutral"
swiss.58.d: "Despite the just nature of our cause, the Austrians have failed to come to our aid against the French menace. We cannot rely on the Habsburgs to assist us."
swiss.58.a: "Curses!"

swiss.59.t: "Looking Again for Foreign Aid"
swiss.59.d: "With our most recent diplomatic efforts not turning out the way we had hoped, we likely only have one more chance to appeal to a foreign power before we run out of time..."

swiss.60.t: "We Have Been Abandoned"
swiss.60.d: "Despite our best efforts to gain international support for our cause, it seems that no nation is willing to stand for justice against the imperialism of the French Commune. We have been abandoned by our neighbours, and there is no choice left but to give in to the French demands. We cannot hope to win on our own."
swiss.60.a: "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides."

swiss.61.t: "Revolution in Switzerland"
swiss.61.d: "Despite our initial intentions of only inciting revolt in Haute-Savoie, it seems that our efforts to destabilise Switzerland have exceeded our wildest expectations. Rather than stopping in the Western cantons and holding their ground, revolutionary forces have instead advanced east, bolstered by local support and army defections. These forces have successfully toppled the Federal Government in Bern, and are now looking to us for support of their new government."
swiss.61.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.62.t: "Syndicalist Uprising"
swiss.62.d: "What initially appeared as fringe uprising in the Western cantons has spread like wildfire east, with Syndicalist supporters rising to support an ever-growing flood of revolutionary sentiment that has swept through the nation. The army, feebly led and unwilling to take decisive action against the civilians, has been wholly ineffective at stopping their march on the capital. As the sun rises, a new, Syndicalist government claims control of the nation."
swiss.62.a: "How could this have happened?"

swiss.63.t: "Crisis in Haute-Savoie"
swiss.63.d: "With the rising escalations in the Romandie and Haute-Savoie regions and France's seeming willingness to intervene in our internal affairs, the situation in Haute-Savoie looks grim. It is only a matter of time before the situation spirals out of our control. We must prepare for the worst."
swiss.63.a: "Worrisome."

swiss.64.t: "France Demands Reforms"
swiss.64.d: "Sensing our apparent weakness and willingness to surrender to their terms, France has responded to our offer to surrender Haute-Savoie with incredulity, informing us that our response in "insincere" and obviously insufficient to guarantee the rights of Syndicalist supporters not only in Romandie, but in the whole of Switzerland. They have offered to send "advisers" to our nation in order to ensure that the proper reforms are passed "for the good of all Swiss peoples"."
swiss.64.a: "This is the only way to avoid bloodshed."

swiss.65.t: "The Swiss Give In"
swiss.65.d: "After we properly informed the Swiss that their proposal to cede Haute-Savoie was not in our best interests, they have further shown their weakness and aversion to conflict by agreeing to our proposals of instituting reforms in the nation to protect the rights of Syndicalists in the nation. No doubt these reforms will lead to the eventual supremacy of Syndicalism in the nation, and the Swiss will surely drift into our own sphere of influence."
swiss.65.a: "The revolution spreads!"

swiss.66.t: "War with France!"
swiss.66.d: "Despite our best efforts to both gain international support for our cause and prevent any bloodshed, both our trustworthy ally and France have both refused to back down. It seems that we must fight to maintain our independence from French aggression."
swiss.66.a: "We will defend ourselves to the end."

swiss.68.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Backs Our Position"
swiss.68.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to back our position in our diplomatic conflict against France. Hopefully we will not need them to resolve this peacefully."
swiss.68.a: "We owe them a great deal."

swiss.69.t: "A Meeting of Officers"
swiss.69.d: "We have received suspicious reports of large meetings of military officers meeting late in the evenings, and long into the night. While this is not a cause for concern in and of itself, the fact that all of these men are members of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has caused some in the National Council to take note. Could the officers be planning something?"
swiss.69.a: "Worrisome."

swiss.70.t: "Selection of a General"
swiss.70.d: "In times of peace and stability the highest attainable rank in the Swiss military is that of Colonel. Only in times of great need or looming military conflict is a man promoted to the rank of General in order to lead the defence of the nation. Now that we have been thrust into a time of great crisis, it is time for us to select a General to lead the command of our armed forces."
swiss.70.a: "The charismatic Henri Guisan."
swiss.70.b: "The well-connected Eugen Bircher."
swiss.70.c: "Ulrich Wille Jr, who will follow in his Father's Footsteps."

swiss.71.t: "Union Nationale Rally"
swiss.71.d: "Earlier today fringe Syndicalist radicals "Union Nationale" held a rally in the streets of Geneva against the "wilful suppression" of the Swiss workers by the current government. While such a fringe rally would normally be of no concern, the sheer amount of people in attendance has caught the government's eye.\n\nThousands of people were in attendance, seemingly hanging on every word of the main speaker, Georges Oltramare. It seems that Syndicalist sentiment is more prevalent in the West than we previously thought."
swiss.71.a: "We will have to keep an eye on them."

swiss.72.t: "Vorarlberg Defects"
swiss.72.d: "With our neighbour Austria on the verge of complete collapse in their ongoing war, some of its citizens have taken their futures into their own hands. The Bundesland of Vorarlberg, right on our eastern border with Austria, has held a public referendum to leave Austria behind and seek union with Switzerland.\n\nOver 80% of voters agreed with the proposal, and the local authorities have wasted no time pleading their case with us, hoping to avoid whatever cruel peace awaits them if Austria were to fall in their current war. The citizens of Vorarlberg are certainly willing, should we accept this new member of the Swiss state?"
swiss.72.a: "We gladly accept."
swiss.72.b: "It is too risky."

swiss.73.t: "Vorarlberg's Defection"
swiss.73.d: "It is no secret that things are not going well in the current war. Many key cities across the empire are in our enemy's hands, and morale is low. However, news has now reached us that the traitorous province of Vorarlberg has voted to leave the Empire entirely, and joined Switzerland instead!\n\nCan these traitors not see that a turn of fortunes is soon on its way? We will have to deal with these traitors, in time."
swiss.73.a: "Damn them!"

swiss.74.t: "Germany has Intervened in the Crisis"
swiss.74.d: "Despite not directly asking for their backing, it seems that the German Kaiser has seen the need to protect the order in Europe, and has intervened on our behalf against the Syndicalist menace. Could this turn the tide against the French hordes?"
swiss.74.a: "Wonderful!"

swiss.75.t: "Germany has Intervened Against Us"
swiss.75.d: "Despite the Swiss not asking for their assistance, the German Kaiser, delusional in his power, has seen fit to throw his nation into war against our glorious crusade. Surely this is the end of Germany's reign over Europe."
swiss.75.a: "German dogs!"

swiss.78.t: "The Government Moves to Geneva"
swiss.78.d: "With the collapse of the government in Bern following the Syndicalist uprising, a loose coalition of Unions was formed to handle governmental affairs. It has become painfully apparent that this haphazard group of Unions is not capable of running the government and all its functions.\n\nInstead, a new government has been formed under the guidance of the Genenva Council of State, with the assistance of the French Commune. This new government will operate the state until a proper constitution can be formed for the new Switzerland."
swiss.78.a: "We are in their hands."

swiss.79.t: "The End of Swiss Neutrality"
swiss.79.d: "Despite our best efforts to avoid foreign entanglements and conflicts, Switzerland has found itself embroiled in a war. Our neutrality, maintained for over a hundred years, has finally been broken as men young and old are called up in service of their country."
swiss.79.a: "Today, we fight."

swiss.80.t: "Georges Oltramare visits England"
swiss.80.d: "In response to an invitation from Birmingham to create a 'new Socialism', local Syndicalist agitator Georges Oltramare, leader of the radical Union Nationale party, has left the nation in order to pursue the tenets of a new 'Totalist' ideology.\n\nA longtime fan of Mussolini's National-Syndicalist movement in Italy, Oltramare's political leanings have become increasingly more radical and his supporters more numerous. His advocacy for an even more extreme form of Syndicalism can only bring further unrest to the nation."
swiss.80.a: "We'll keep an eye on him."

swiss.81.t: "Oltramare visits Mussolini"
swiss.81.d: "After his rapid ascention to power in former Switzerland, leader Georges Oltramare found time today to fulfil one of longtime dreams as he made an official state visit to the Italian Socialist Republic. While there was the usual pomp and circumstance in the visit, Oltramre made it quite clear that he was only there to spend time with his personal hero, Benito Mussolini.\n\nOltramare was reported to have nothing but praise for the Italian head of state, who in turn seemed to enjoy the generous compliments. Together, the two promised 'a new era in Helvetic-Italian relations' and increased cooperation between the two Totalist nations."
swiss.81.a: "To future cooperation!"

swiss.82.t: "Protests against German Favouratism"
swiss.82.d: "An organised protest was held today in the capital against the state's new policies on official languages. Thousands of Swiss citizens who speak French, Italian, or Romansch in their daily lives were seen chanting anti-government slogans and disrupting traffic around the city.\n\nRomansch speakers in particular are incited over the change, given that their language was made official via referendum in Switzerland only a year ago. Local forces are more than prepared to handle protests of these size, but the people have made their displeasure known to the government."
swiss.82.a: "That was then, this is now."

swiss.83.t: "Loyalty in the Officer Corps"
swiss.83.d: "With the government firmly in the hands of the proper German-Swiss authorities, it has come to the attention of many in the upper echelons of the new government that there are officers in the Swiss army with questionable loyalties.\n\nThe loss of Switzerland's non-German speaking territories is a blow the strength of the nation, however the greater threat of disloyal officers still looms. An internal review of officers born in Romandie and other French-speaking regions of the nation has begun, and those viewed to be potential threats are to be detained."
swiss.83.a: "Weeds in the garden."

swiss.84.t: "The Bern Trials"
swiss.84.d: "After a lengthy internal review of the Swiss Officer Corps, officers loyal to the state have compiled a definitive list of those deemed potential threats to the new military government. Dozens of officers from French or Italian backgrounds, or those known to harbour Syndicalist leanings, have been detained and brought before a special military tribunal in Bern.\n\nThe show trials of these officers will strengthen the loyalty of the current officer corps to the state and ensure that any future officers know that treason will not be tolerated. However, many officers in custody hold high office within the military, and the removal of these officers is sure to dampen the strength of our forces."
swiss.84.a: "Let the trials begin."

swiss.85.t: "The Trial of Gustave Combe"
swiss.85.d: "The trial has begun for Staff Officer Gustave Combe, born in Orbe to a French-speaking family. His preference for French and potential loyalty to his family in French-occupied Romandie has marked him as a potential liabilty in the new Swiss military.\n\nThe trial has commenced and the charges laid against him seem damning."
swiss.85.a: "Guilty."
swiss.85.b: "Combe is a man of character. Innocent!"

swiss.86.t: "The Trial of Louis de Montmollin"
swiss.86.d: "The trial has begun for Artillery Officer Louis de Montmollin, a French speaking officer born in Savagnier, Neuchâtel. Montmollin is both from a French-speaking household hailing from the cantons lost to France, and has shown previous Syndicalist leanings, refusing to participate in military actions taken against Syndicalist supporters within the country.\n\nWith this information, the state has determined that officer de Montmollin is a great potential risk and must be removed from his post immediately."
swiss.86.a: "Guilty."
swiss.86.b: "Louis is a sterling officer. Innocent!"

swiss.87.t: "The Trial of Henri Guisan"
swiss.87.d: "The trial has begun for Officer Henri Guisan, distinguished Swiss Officer and the most high-ranking man brought in for trial.\n\nGuisan's arrest is undoubtedly politically motivated, due to his high position and Ulrich Wille's alleged distate of the man. Losing his talents would set our military back considerably.\n\nGuisan is beloved by both his men and acquaintances alike, and has several friends in high ranking places and a sentence for him would be very unpopular. However, letting him go would show that the current government is perhaps not as powerful as they would have the people believe..."
swiss.87.a: "Guilty."
swiss.87.b: "Guisan deserves better. Innocent!"

swiss.88.t: "Continuing the Trials"
swiss.88.d: "The most high-proflie trials are over for now, but there are still many who must face the military's justice. Traitors and Syndicalists alike face trial, and perhaps a directive from the government could speed the process..."
swiss.88.a: "Most are Guilty."
swiss.88.b: "The rest are undoubtedly innocent."

swiss.89.t: "The Trials Conclude"
swiss.89.d: "After many long weeks of innocence and guilt, the trials of the Swiss Officer Corps are completed, and many have been either exonerated or retired. This process has ensured that the new Swiss military is one loyal to the state, but at what cost..."
swiss.89.a: "We now stand united."

swiss.90.t: "Defection of Loius de Montmollin"
swiss.90.d: "Officer Louis de Montmollin, after being declared innocent in the Bern Trials months before, has today been reported to have fled over the border into the Commune of France. He took with him several like-minded officers who either escaped arrest or were declared innocent in the trials, along with crucial information on our military deployments against the French.\n\nThe whole affair is seen as an embarrassment for the regime in Bern and many are wondering if the military are truly in control."
swiss.90.a: "We were fools to trust him."

swiss.91.t: "Ineffectual Purges"
swiss.91.d: "After the widely publicised show trials in Bern, the government has almost nothing to show for their efforts. We failed to prosecute any officers of note, and the people have taken us to be utter buffoons. How could we hold such trials and make no convictions?"
swiss.91.a: "We look like fools."

swiss.92.t: "New Generation of Officers"
swiss.92.d: "Months have passed, and a new generation of officers loyal to the state have entered the military. Month by month, the effects of the Bern Trials on our military effectiveness fade."
swiss.92.a: "Loyal officers are good officers."

swiss.93.t: "Swiss Officers Defect"
swiss.93.d: "After the end of the Savoyard Crisis, the Swiss government to our east was quickly overthrown by pro-German military officers who felt that the government had failed them. Paranoid and angry at French-speaking Swiss for 'betraying' their nation, they quickly began purging French elements of their military structure.\n\nThis approach has obviously backfired, as today a group of former Swiss officers fled over the border into France, seeking asylum from their oppressive government. They bring with them many secret Swiss military documents, which will surely be of use to us."
swiss.93.a: "Welcome, brothers."

swiss.100.t: "Memories Fade"
swiss.100.d: "With the bloodless resolution of the crisis in Haute-Savoie, Syndicalist agitations within the borders of our nation have faded. Old grudges have begun to be forgotten and a new period of unity is dawning. Those who remain as Syndicalist supporters have mostly begun resorting to more peaceable forms of political activism, and the political tension that once gripped the country is no more."
swiss.100.a: "We are brothers."

swiss.101.t: "France Loses Interest"
swiss.101.d: "Despite increasing tensions between ourselves and the French commune over the status of Haute-Savoie, today we have learned that the French government has suddenly dropped all plans to incense activism inside of Switzerland. It seems that the government in Paris has become dissuaded from pursuing the matter further, content to simply rattle its saber. We have dodged what could have become a major international crisis."
swiss.101.a: "Luck is on our side."

swiss.102.t: "Backstabbed!"
swiss.102.d: "Despite an initial promise of assistance against the French Commune, our ally has instead reversed that promise and instead publicly declared non-interference against this imperialist land-grab by the French Commune! It seems that our ally wanted to call France's bluff, but when France did not back down, they fled from the fight like the cowards they are. We are all alone in the world."
swiss.102.a: "Damn them all!"

swiss.103.t: "The Savoyard Crisis Defused"
swiss.103.d: "For many months, the regions of Romandie and Haute-Savoie have been gripped by tension as Swiss socialists have petitioned the Commune of France for annexation and intervention in order to unite the French speaking peoples under one banner. However, it appears that despite initial threats against the stability of the Swiss nation, no intervention seems forthcoming from the Commune. Lacking a serious supporter and seemingly acting against the wishes of the greater Swiss nation, today Syndicalist leaders have met with the Federal government for what appears to be the first of many negotiations to end the hostilities. It seems that peace has won the day, the crisis is over."
swiss.103.a: "Peace reigns."

swiss.104.t: "The Savoyard Crisis Defused"
swiss.104.d: "Despite the earlier opportunity to support the French-speaking regions of Switzerland against their capitalist oppressors, we have not found supporting their movement in our best interests. Now news has come from Switzerland that Syndicalist revolutionaries in the nation, disheartened at our lack of support, have decided to enter formal negotiations with the Swiss federal government. Whatever comes of these talks, our chance to intervene has passed."
swiss.104.a: "An opportunity lost."

swiss.105.t: "Diplomatic Mission to the Commune"
swiss.105.d: "Now that the crisis in Haute-Savoie has passed without bloodshed, there are many who have seen the extreme dangers of having an unfriendly power such as the Commune of France right on our border. The Federal Government has decided the only way to rectify this situation is to improve bilateral relations between ourselves and the French. An diplomatic mission has been sent to the Commune to attempt to defuse the hostilities."
swiss.105.a: "Let's make the attempt."

swiss.106.t: "Diplomatic Mission from Switzerland"
swiss.106.d: "Swiss diplomats arrived today in Paris to discuss the state of relations between our two countries. Previously our two states were on opposite sides of the Savoyard Crisis, but now that the crisis is behind us, it seems that the Swiss are eager to get in our good graces."
swiss.106.a: "Let's negotiate."
swiss.106.b: "Swiss? We have no need of the Swiss."

swiss.107.t: "Turned Away from Paris"
swiss.107.d: "Despite the earnest efforts of our diplomatic team to the French Commune, the French seem unwilling to negotiate with us on restoring friendly relations. We will have to remain vigilant on our shared border."
swiss.107.a: "A shame."

swiss.108.t: "Extracting Concessions"
swiss.108.d: "As the Swiss are more damaged by our poor bilateral relations, it is possible that they will agree to concessions in exchange for economic cooperation and the lifting of trade sanctions.\n\nOn the other hand, asking for too much threatens to leave the negotiations entirely. Should we make demands?"
swiss.108.a: "Demand the return of Haute-Savoie."
swiss.108.b: "Demand the concession of French Romandie."
swiss.108.c: "Demand economic concessions."
swiss.108.e: "Demand no concessions."

swiss.109.t: "The French Demand Concessions"
swiss.109.d: "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the concession of Haute-Savoie to the Commune. The Commune has declared that as the one and only legal French government, we are obligated to return Haute-Savoie under the terms of the Congress of Vienna. How should we respond?"
swiss.109.a: "We must accept."
swiss.109.b: "No!"
swiss.109.c: "This is outrageous! We're leaving!"

swiss.110.t: "The French Demand Concessions"
swiss.110.d: "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the cession of Romandie to the Commune. France has claimed that the French-speaking majority, rife with Syndicalist supporters, belongs as a proper part of the French nation. How should we respond?"
swiss.110.a: "We must accept."
swiss.110.b: "No!"
swiss.110.c: "This is outrageous! We're leaving!"

swiss.111.t: "The French Demand Concessions"
swiss.111.d: "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by an agreement to economic concessions. Any trade deal we sign with the French will be required to assist them more than it assists us. How should we respond?"
swiss.111.a: "We must accept."
swiss.111.b: "No!"
swiss.111.c: "This is outrageous! We're leaving!"

swiss.113.t: "The Swiss are Outraged"
swiss.113.d: "The Swiss response to our demands was one of complete shock. After hours of quiet discussion in private, the delegation has decided that our demands were simply insulting and belied an unwillingness to properly negotiate.\n\nThe entire delegation left soon after, and do not seem intent on returning for another round of talks."
swiss.113.a: "Negotiations have broken down..."

swiss.114.t: "Rejection of our Demands"
swiss.114.d: "In response to our demands, the Swiss have soundly rejected any sort of concessions, and seem unwilling to consider the negotiations if concessions are on the table.\n\nThey are unlikely to back down on this stance."
swiss.114.a: "They called our bluff. We will cooperate without concessions."
swiss.114.b: "No concessions, no negotiations."
swiss.115.t: "France Expels our Diplomats"
swiss.115.d: "We have informed the French negotiators that we are unwilling to continue negotiations if the French are going to demand concessions. In response, the French have expelled our delegation and halted negotiations. There will be no deal with the French."
swiss.115.a: "Unfortunate."

swiss.116.t: "The nature of our Cooperation?"
swiss.116.d: "After agreeing to the initial French demands, the ball is now in our court. Rather than simply restoring relations, it is possible that Switzerland and France can work together and create a relationship that will benefit us both. What sort of relationship should we pursue?"
swiss.116.a: "Political Cooperation."
swiss.116.b: "Technological Cooperation."
swiss.116.c: "Economic Cooperation."
swiss.116.e: "Just restoring trade will be enough."

swiss.117.t: "Nature of Cooperation?"
swiss.117.d: "The French have agreed to negotiate with us, and have made no unreasonable demands of us in the process!. Rather than simply restoring relations, it is possible that Switzerland and France can work together and create a relationship that will benefit us both. What sort of relationship should we pursue?"
swiss.117.a: "Political Cooperation."
swiss.117.b: "Technological Cooperation."
swiss.117.c: "Economic Cooperation."
swiss.117.e: "Just restoring trade will be enough."

swiss.118.t: "End of Negotiations"
swiss.118.political: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation. Both of our nations will open an official embassy with the other and trade will be restored. Both nations promise to foster improved relations with the other. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
swiss.118.techno: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of technological cooperation. Both of our nations will cooperate on technological development with the other and trade will be restored. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
swiss.118.economo: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation. Both of our nations will cooperate on economic development and trade will be restored. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
swiss.118.nothin: "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation. Trade will be restored between our two nations. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
swiss.118.a: "We agree to the terms."

swiss.119.t: "Successful Negotiations"
swiss.119.d: "Despite the political and military differences between ourselves and the Swiss, the negotiations have gone a long way towards restoring normal relations. We will see how the fruits of these negotiations fare in the coming months."
swiss.119.a: "The Swiss have made amends."

swiss.120.t: "Successful Negotiations"
swiss.120.d: "Despite the political and military differences between ourselves and the French Commune, the negotiations have gone a long way towards restoring normal relations. Hopefully this negotiated peace will last."
swiss.120.a: "The political freeze is over."

swiss.121.t: "Switzerland Recognises the Commune"
swiss.121.d: "We have received news that as part of a negotiated deal with the Commune of France, the Swiss government has officially recognised the Commune of France as the legitimate French government. This leaves us in an awkward position, as the Swiss government previously recognised us as the sole legitimate government of France.\n\nWe will not forget this slight!"
swiss.121.a: "Damn them!"

swiss.122.t: "Peace with the Commune?"
swiss.122.d: "We have gone to war in defence of the small Swiss nation against the Commune of France. Initially, we had hoped to hold the French at the border, and force them into a negotiated peace that would ensure the integrity of the Swiss nation.\n\nThis plan has failed, and as we speak enemies march into Austria itself! We must sue for a negotiated peace now before it is too late."
swiss.122.a: "Sue for peace."
swiss.122.b: "Peace?! Never!"

swiss.123.t: "Austria Sues for Peace"
swiss.123.d: "Our war of liberation against Switzerland and their Austrian allies is going well. So well, in fact, that the Austrians have come to us with an offer of peace. Austria itself is being invaded, and Vienna is looking to get out of this unfavorable war.\n\nIt is obvious that they are on the losing end of this war, and it should be possible to extract heavy concessions out of them if we so choose. How should we respond?"
swiss.123.a: "White Peace will do fine."
swiss.123.b: "Demand heavy concessions."
swiss.123.c: "There will be no peace but our victory!"

swiss.124.t: "An Offer of White Peace"
swiss.124.d: "France has responded to our request for a negotiated peace by offering us favourable terms. White peace between ourselves and the French Commune, but Switzerland will be left to the French will.\n\nConsidering our military situation, it seems like the best offer we will ever get..."
swiss.124.a: "We Accept!"
swiss.124.b: "We can't betray Switzerland!"

swiss.125.t: "An Offer of A Harsh Peace"
swiss.125.d: "France has responded to our request for a negotiated peace by offering us harsh terms. We will be forced to cut all ties with the Italian Republic, and be forced to cede some land to France's new regime in former Switzerland. Switzerland itself will be left to suffer whatever fate the Commune dreams for it. We will pay minor economic reparations for our part in the war.\n\nConsidering our military situation, it seems like a decent offer..."
swiss.125.a: "We Accept."
swiss.125.b: "These terms are unacceptable!"

swiss.126.t: "No Peace!"
swiss.126.d: "The French have completely refused to negotiate any sort of peace with us, stating that the only peace we will receive is one dictated to us from our own halls in Vienna. The French will not negotiate with us."
swiss.126.a: "We will not lose!"

swiss.127.t: "Austria Accepts White Peace"
swiss.127.d: "The Austrians were all to eager to accept our offer of a white peace, even if it means leaving the Swiss to their fate. Peace will be signed with the Austrians, and we will have a free hand to do as we like with the Swiss."
swiss.127.a: "A wise choice."

swiss.128.t: "Austrian Betrayal"
swiss.128.d: "The war was certainly not going well, but the latest news from Vienna is simply shocking. The Austrians have signed a peace agreement with the French. And even worse, they have agreed to let the French do as they will with our nation. It seems as though this is the end for our nation..."
swiss.128.a: "Enemies on all sides!"

swiss.129.t: "Our Terms Rejected"
swiss.129.d: "Despite being the nation to initiate the process of peace, the Austrians have rejected the terms we so politely offered them, and instead have insisted on seeing this war to its conclusion.\n\nThey will soon know the error of their ways."
swiss.129.a: "War it is, then."

swiss.130.t: "Austria Surrenders"
swiss.130.d: "Austria, seeing the dire situation they are in, have accepted our most generous terms and will cede all of the territory we have requested of them. In addition, Switzerland has been abandoned to its fate and is ours to do with as we please.\n\nOur allies the Socialist Republic of Italy will be most ecstatic to hear this news."
swiss.130.a: "A nice bonus."

swiss.131.t: "Austria and Italy"
swiss.131.d: "Unbeknownst to us, the Austrians and French have been engaged in a series of peace talks regarding our current conflict over Switzerland. A peace deal has been reached, and France has secured us an agreement which will see the Austrians revoking all support from their pathetic puppet Italian Republic. It is only a matter of time before that false state flounders without its puppet master's strings."
swiss.131.a: "A true ally."

swiss.132.t: "Austrian Evacuation"
swiss.132.d: "Unbeknownst to us, the Austrians and French have been engaged in a series of peace talks regarding our current conflict over Switzerland. A peace deal has been reached, and the Austrians have not come out on top. As a part of the agreement, they will be forced to sever all ties with us, essentially leaving us to be swallowed by the Socialist Republic of Italy. Times are grim."
swiss.132.a: "Damn."

swiss.133.t: "Swiss-Germans Flee Syndicalist Rule"
swiss.133.d: "With the new Syndicalist regime seizing control of Switzerland, there are many who have something to fear from the changing of the guard. Thousands of Swiss, fearing Syndicalist reprisals, have fled over the border into Germany seeking the protection of the German Empire."
swiss.133.a: "We didn't need them."

swiss.134.t: "Swiss Refugees"
swiss.134.d: "With the Swiss government overthrown by Syndicalist rebels, there is chaos in many predominantly German cities in Switzerland. Many, fearing punitive action from the new government, have fled across the border into Germany and are seeking the protection of the Kaiser from the Syndicalist menace."
swiss.134.a: "Welcome them."
swiss.135.t: "The Red Cross"
swiss.135.d: "The Second Weltkrieg has begun, and the Red Cross, based in Geneva, has begun to organise in response to the predicted casualties. The Red Cross will help both sides in the war, taking no sides, and surely countless lives will be saved by their efforts.\n\nIn the last war, Red Cross societies delivered tens of millions of letters and parcels, sent out millions of Francs in aid, facilitated the transfer of hundreds of thousands of prisoners, and saved countless lives.\n\nLet us hope that they will not need to do as much in this war."
swiss.135.a: "War is hell."

swiss.136.t: "Defeat in Switzerland?"
swiss.136.d: "In what was widely considered by the High Command to be a quick and easy war, we have found ourselves on the back foot in our fight against the Swiss and their Austrian defenders. In order to save face in the international community, many have suggested we sue for peace immediately before our ineptitude on the battlefield becomes internationally observed."
swiss.136.a: "Sue for peace."
swiss.136.b: "Never!"

swiss.137.t: "France Begs for Mercy"
swiss.137.d: "There are high spirits all around as a French delegation arrived today with the intent to negotiate a peace between our two nations. It is no secret that the war is going very poorly for the French, and they are surely eager to end the war as soon as possible.\n\nThis would be a great opportunity to demand more out of them..."
swiss.137.a: "Peace is enough."
swiss.137.b: "Seize the rest of Savoie."
swiss.137.c: "We're marching to Paris!"

swiss.138.t: "Switzerland Accepts White Peace"
swiss.138.d: "Switzerland has responded favorably to our request for a settled peace, it seems that they are as eager to end the war as we are. All land gained or lost during the course of the conflict is to be returned to its original owner, and both sides are to return and lick their wounds. The war is over."
swiss.138.a: "We got off easy."

swiss.139.t: "Switzerland Demands Savoie"
swiss.139.d: "The Swiss are willing to accept our offer of peace, but only on the condition that we hand over stewardship of the rest of the Savoie region. They do have a legal claim to the region, dating back to 1815 and the Congress of Vienna, but this is an obviously opportunistic land grab.\n\nHowever, in our current situation, we are not in a position to refuse their demand. They could certainly have demanded worse..."
swiss.139.a: "We have no choice."

swiss.140.t: "Switzerland Refuses Peace"
swiss.140.d: "Despite our generous offer of peace in the face of the Swiss advance, we have received news that the Swiss are refusing any and all offers of peace. It seems that the mad Swiss are so confident in their invincibility that they think they can defeat the whole Commune. We will take pleasure in destroying these fools."
swiss.140.a: "They are overconfident buffoons."

swiss.141.t: "Peace with France!"
swiss.141.d: "News has arrived today that Switzerland has reached a negotiated peace with France. This is a victory for both ourselves and the Swiss, the Syndicalist menace has shown its weakness for all the world to see!"
swiss.141.a: "Peace is restored."

swiss.142.t: "Victory!"
swiss.142.d: "We have come out victorious in the war against France! The people are cheering in the streets and parades are being held in honour of our victorious troops all around the nation. It is time to celebrate!"
swiss.142.a: "A hard fought peace."

swiss.143.t: "Occupation of Haute-Savoie"
swiss.143.d: "In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna Switzerland was given the legal right to maintain the neutrality of Haute-Savoie in exchange for relinquishing all official claims on the region. During the Weltkrieg, as France was falling to Syndicalist revolutionaries, the Swiss government found it necessary to send soldiers to protect the region from the chaotic violence of the time.\n\nShortly after, the true French government was exiled to Africa, and Switzerland has maintained her military occupation of the region until a time that France returns to the mainland to reclaim it.\n\nThis of course has not sat well with the current government in Paris, which has actively attempted to reclaim the province."
swiss.143.a: "We will fulfil our legal mandate."

swiss.144.t: "KKP and BGB Leave the Bourgeois Block"
swiss.144.d: "The Bourgeois Block, the informal alliance of the popular Market Liberal FDP with the BGB and KKP conservative parties, has long stood as the most stalwart of Swiss political institutions, working to ensure that conservative interests are satisfied and that aggressive Radical Socialist and Syndicalist parties remain marginalised. Today that relationship was severed as the Catholic-Conservative Party (KKP) and the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB) announced their loss of confidence in FDP's ability to handle the economy in the wake of the Black Monday disaster.\n\nWith Switzerland's greatest political parties beginning to fight amongst themselves rather than against socialism, there will be room for smaller parties to make their move."
swiss.144.a: "We are in a precarious situation."

swiss.145.t: "Swiss National Day"
swiss.145.d: "August 1st, is the Schweizer Bundesfeier, the anniversary of the signing of the Federal Charter of 1291, and is cause for celebration across the nation!"
swiss.145.a: "Go us!"

swiss.146.t: "Bircher and Sonderegger speak against Syndicalists"
swiss.146.d: "Eugen Bircher, an influential Colonel in the Swiss military, accompanied by influential right-wing leader Emil Sonderegger, made a speech today in front of the National Council, wherein he pled with the council to 'slay the beast' that was the Syndicalist movements spreading within the nation.\n\nEugen Bircher leads the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband, while Emil Sonderegger leads the Volksbund, both paramilitary pro-German societies that has been gaining influence among prominent Swiss military officers and politicians.\n\nThe colonel has been increasingly vocal both in public and in private of his distaste for Syndicalist and Socialist movements in Switzerland, and his opinion holds considerable sway."
swiss.146.a: "Hm."

swiss.150.t: "New Political Rivalries"
swiss.150.d: "With the old Federal government overthrown by proper Syndicalists and a new interim government created in its place, a clear struggle is forming between the two main Syndicalist parties for control.\n\nOne is the Union Nationale under Georges Oltramare, adherents of the more radical Totalist charter. Their main opponents are the SPdS, the more mainstream Syndicalist party under Jules Humbert-Droz.\n\nWith the need to form a new government apparent, both sides have been rallying their supporters in a bid to be the first party come out on top."
swiss.150.a: "Why can't we get along?"

swiss.151.t: "Union Nationale March"
swiss.151.d: "The Union Nationale party, not wanting to wait for official discussions, got off to a head start today as party leaders organised a large march through the capital's streets. Thousands were in attendance and Union Nationale has shown that it has the support of many Swiss citizens."
swiss.151.a: "Oltramare takes the lead."

swiss.152.t: "Jules Humbert-Droz Speaks Against Totalism"
swiss.152.d: "Not content to allow the Union Nationale to simply walk away with the nation, today Jules Humbert-Droz broadcast a powerful radio address to the nation.\n\nIn his speech, he rallied against the extremist messages of Union Nationale, and warned that supporting such a party would betray the true spirit of the revolution. Many have been swayed by the SPdS leader's message and Oltramare's support has fallen overnight."
swiss.152.a: "A fair point."

swiss.153.t: "Violence in Bern"
swiss.153.d: "In recent weeks, both the Totalist Union Nationale and the more traditionalist SPdS parties have been working hard to show themselves as the front running party in the movement to assemble the new government.\n\nWith such a close race, tensions are bound to be high, and today a violent fight erupted in Bern between supporters of the two groups. Similar bouts of violence have been popping up around the nation, and the Union Council is beginning to worry that the violence will only escalate from here."
swiss.153.a: "Order is breaking down."

swiss.154.t: "The Union Council Calls for Formal Debate"
swiss.154.d: "In an effort to stop the violence spreading across the nation, the temporary Union Council has stepped into the fray in an attempt to resolve things peacefully. It has called upon both parties to agree to a series of formal debates, to be broadcast nationally over radio, in which both parties will attempt to state their case to the general populace.\n\nTo everyone's relief, the leaders of both parties have agreed and the debates are set to begin shortly."
swiss.154.a: "Let's settle this peacefully."

swiss.155.t: "The Debate Begins"
swiss.155.d: "Tonight marked the first round of the formal debates being held between the Union Nationale led by Geroges Oltramare and the SPdS led by Jules Humbert-Droz. Many topics were covered ranging from economic agenda to political reforms. While there are more debates to come, whoever is more successful in this first debate is likely to carry public support through subsequent debates.\n\nBoth potential leaders have good points but there can only be one winner."
swiss.155.a: "Georges Oltramare is victorious!"
swiss.155.b: "Jules Humbert-Droz has won!"

swiss.156.t: "Union Nationale Wins Public Support"
swiss.156.d: "Georges Oltramare's impassioned speech in the formal debate, combined with his multitude of rallies and marches, have shown the people of Switzerland that Union Nationale is the only party with enough support to form the new Syndicalist government. The Totalist movement has taken hold of the nation."
swiss.156.a: "Oltramare will form the new government."

swiss.157.t: "SPdS Wins Public Support"
swiss.157.d: "With Jules Humbert-Droz's sterling performance in the governmental debate, and the passion of his speeches against Totalism and Georges Oltramare, the hearts of the people have moved behind the SPdS. Union Nationale remains popular, but it is obvious that it no longer has enough public support to take the lead in the new government."
swiss.157.a: "Jules Humbert-Droz will form the new government."

swiss.159.t: "Foundation of the Swiss Merchant Marine"
swiss.159.d: "As Switzerland is a landlocked nation, it relies on trade with other nations to survive. To this end, the Swiss government has commissioned the purchase of several merchant vessels to operate under the Swiss flag.\n\nThese merchant vessels will participate in vital trade missions which will secure the necessary goods Switzerland needs to survive should her borders become compromised by conflict."
swiss.159.a: "Interesting."
swiss.160.t: "Christening of the EKS Helvetia"
swiss.160.d: "There was much celebration and excitement today as the government announced the official christening of the Swiss Navy's first flagship, the EKS Helvetia. This ship, a Light Cruiser produced from Switzerland's very own dockyards, is the first official flagship of the fleet and a symbol of Switzerland's overseas ambitions."
swiss.160.a: "The Swiss were born to sail."

swiss.163.t: "Syndicalist Parties Banned"
swiss.163.d: "With the new provisional military government in control of the nation, a proclamation has come from Bern that all Syndicalist organisations operating in the country, legally or otherwise, are to be immediately dissolved. This proclamation has been met with a surprising amount of popular support, as the remaining population of the country rallies against Syndicalist "traitors"."
swiss.163.a: "We're better off without them."

swiss.164.t: "Full Membership in Mitteleuropa"
swiss.164.d: "An agreement has been made to allow for economic supplies to flow from Mitteleuropa into Switzerland to keep the nation afloat. However, while this temporary arrangement is supporting our economy for now, perhaps we should consider full membership in Germany's economic bloc?"
swiss.164.a: "Let's join."
swiss.164.b: "Rather not."

swiss.165.t: "Farmers Hit by Black Monday"
swiss.165.d: "With the German economy in freefall, the prices of many agricultural goods have fallen with it. Swiss farmers, heavily reliant on trade with Germany, have been hit hard almost overnight, and many have taken to the streets to protest the government's inaction over the issue. The BGB (Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents) who represents the interests of many Swiss farmers, and Social Conservative KKP (Catholic-Conservative Party) have begun wavering in their commitment to the current governing alliance of Conservative and Market Liberal parties."
swiss.165.a: "This isn't good."

swiss.166.t: "Socialists Propose Reconciliation With France"
swiss.166.d: "As a part of their ambitious Syndicalist-styled plan to recover the Swiss economy, Socialist leaders in the Romandie have proposed that the Swiss government save the economy through reconciliation with the Commune of France.\n\nEver since Switzerland began the occupation of Haute-Savoie, the French have embargoed Switzerland, and cut off a valuable trade route for the Swiss economy. These socialist leaders have called for the return of this land to France as a sign of goodwill on behalf of Switzerland towards France."
swiss.166.a: "Not a chance."

swiss.167.t: "An Illegal Referendum in Savoie"
swiss.167.d: "With the Federal Government in Bern so adamantly opposed to the Socialist plans for reform, a movement has gained popularity for an organised referendum on sovereignty in Haute-Savoie. The Socialists believe that if the Savoyards can be shown to wish reunification with the Commune of France, then the government will have to support their plans. Bern has caught wind of this illegal referendum taking place in the region soon, and has vowed that such a vote outside of the law will not be allowed to take place."
swiss.167.a: "Stop this at once!"

swiss.168.t: "Violence in Haute-Savoie"
swiss.168.d: "The day of the proposed referendum has come, and violence runs rampant in Haute-Savoie. Swiss military presence in the occupied zone, on high alert on orders from Bern, has clashed repeatedly with Socialist and Syndicalist protestors attempting to organise the vote in the area.\n\nDozens have been beaten and bloodied, and the region is in a state of disarray as military forces and Socialist agitators from Romandie clash in the streets. It is only a matter of time before France hears of this commotion..."
swiss.168.a: "This got out of hand."

swiss.169.t: "Syndicalists Claim Referendum Victory"
swiss.169.d: "Days after the violence in Savoie, the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland has declared that the results of the referendum are in and the region has voted to rejoin the Commune of France. In the chaos, it is impossible to verify the integrity of the vote, and the Socialists, who hold the ballots, have not offered to hand anything over to the federal government. Many in Bern doubt the validity of the Socialist claim, but it has increasingly seemed like a shouting match between two sides that won't back down..."
swiss.169.a: "These results are illegal and unverified!"
swiss.170.t: "Violence in Occupied Haute-Savoie"
swiss.170.d: "Reports have come to Paris bearing news of the violent oppression of Syndicalist freedom fighters in Haute-Savoie who were attempting to organise a referendum on the region's return to French governance. The Swiss government in Bern has sent a military force to suppress the vote, and violence has broken out over the legality of the referendum. We can't ignore this violence against our people!"
swiss.170.a: "Frenchmen bleed on French soil!"

swiss.171.t: "Romandie Secedes"
swiss.171.d: "With no nation willing to defend Switzerland, and our government's weakness exposed for all the world to see, the local governments in Romandie, reinstated by French demands, have quickly voted to secede from the Swiss Confederation and join the Commune of France. We are powerless to stop them."
swiss.171.a: "Traitors, all of them."
swiss.172.t: "The Romand Secession"
swiss.172.d: "After Switzerland pathetically accepted our demands for the return of Haute-Savoie, they were forced to reinstate publicly elected Socialist officials that they so viciously removed from their posts earlier in the year. These politicians, to our surprise, wasted no time in voting on secession from the Swiss Confederation in favour of joining the Commune of France as brothers in French Socialism.\n\nWe of course have accepted their legal and popular move, and have welcomed them into our fold."
swiss.172.a: "A welcome surprise."

swiss.173.t: "A New National Identity"
swiss.173.d: "With the transition of the Swiss State to a more orderly regime under the guidance of the military, many have proposed the creation of a new national flag to represent the new order. A few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
swiss.173.a: "We must maintain our current flag."
swiss.173.b: "The coat of arms on white background."
swiss.173.c: "The nationalist full-cross design."
swiss.173.e: "A flag more suiting the military regime."

swiss.174.t: "A New National Identity"
swiss.174.d: "A new era has dawned for the Swiss people under the new Syndicalist regime, and with it comes the need for a new national symbol and flag. A few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
swiss.174.a: "The Helvetic Design with Syndicalist elements."
swiss.174.b: "The simple Helvetic design."
swiss.174.c: "Continue with the interim flag."
swiss.174.e: "Flag of the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland."

swiss.175.t: "Switzerland Seeks an Alliance"
swiss.175.d: "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to formalize our current relationship and join our new military alliance. How should we respond?"
swiss.175.d_war: "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland requesting we formalize our de-facto relationship, and allow them membership in our new military alliance. How should we respond?"
swiss.175.a: "They made a wise decision."
swiss.175.b: "They would only drag us down."

swiss.176.t: "We Stand with Austria"
swiss.176.d: "Our diplomat to Vienna has sent news that Austria has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance, and welcome us with open arms. We now have a proper protector against any further untoward aggression."
swiss.176.d_war: "Our diplomat to Vienna has sent news that Austria has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance, and welcomes us with open arms."
swiss.176.a: "Our future is bright."

swiss.177.t: "Austria has Ignored Us!"
swiss.177.d: "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Austria with regards to a formalisation of our current impromptu alliance. It seems that the Austrians are keen on keeping us out of their alliance, whatever reason they may have."
swiss.177.a: "But why?"

swiss.178.t: "Chaos in Haute-Savoie!"
swiss.178.d: "With French support and a lax military presence in the region, French saboteurs have managed to stir unrest in Haute-Savoie, and the administration will be forced to spare extra resources to maintain the peace. We must maintain a stronger military presence if we are to keep the region stable."
swiss.178.a: "We were too lax!"

swiss.179.t: "The Commune Defeated"
swiss.179.d: "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe. With the largest threat to our nation now a thing of the past, we no longer have to worry about the looming threat of war."
swiss.179.a: "Peace reigns!"

swiss.180.t: "Returning Haute-Savoie"
swiss.180.d: "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France and a restoration of a legitimate French government, it is time we honour our obligations made at the end of the Weltkrieg and return Haute-Savoie to French control. We have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to our promise is resolute. The territory must be returned, and the French government will surely be grateful for the safeguarding of their land."
swiss.180.italian: "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France, and the consolidation of Savoy under the new Italian regime, it is time we honour our obligations made at the end of the Weltkrieg and return Upper Savoy to Italian control. We have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to our promise is resolute. The territory must be returned, and the Italian government will surely be grateful for the safeguarding of their land."
swiss.180.syndie: "The old Swiss order has been overthrown, and in its place a new and proper Syndicalist government has arisen. In order to solidify our relation with our neighboring Syndicalist Commune of France, we must make good on a promise made many years ago and return Upper Savoy to Communard rule. With this act of cooperation, we can surely align ourselves with the power that is France."
swiss.180.a: "It must go to [735.Owner.GetNameDef]."

swiss.181.t: "The Return of Upper Savoy"
swiss.181.d: "Switzerland has approached us with an offer to return the region of Upper Savoy to our control after controlling the region for nearly two decades. They have deemed our nation the rightful owners of the land, and according to their previous obligation of stewardship, have properly returned the region to us."
swiss.181.a: "They have honored their obligations."

swiss.184.t: "Officers Protest"
swiss.184.d: "Many Officers have resigned out of protest in response to our declaration of Martial Law in the nation. Perhaps driven by some remaining loyalties to Syndicalist elements operating within our borders, these officers will leave a hole in our ranks that can only be filled with time."
swiss.184.a: "This is not ideal."

swiss.185.t: "Our Swiss Assets Nationalized"
swiss.185.d: "We have been informed that the nationalist regime in Switzerland has nationalized all foreign-owned economic assets in their nation in an attempt to gain greater control over their economy. Naturally, we have not-insignificant holdings there, and we are under pressure to regain the lost capital for our citizens."
swiss.185.a: "We won't forget this."

swiss.186.t: "The New Order Falls"
swiss.186.d: "Not even a year after toppling the old Swiss government and establishing a military dictatorship "for the good of the nation", the government of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has shown itself completely incapable of rallying public support.\n\nAn increasing amount of public protests have culminated in a storming of governmental offices in the capital and the seizing of key areas by mutinous military units in league with the uprising.\n\nEugen Bircher and Ulrich Wille Jr. are missing, as are many of the officers involved in the coup, but for now a new government has been created from more moderate conservatives in the government until the old Federal Government can be properly restored."
swiss.186.a: "Long live Switzerland."

swiss.187.t: "Outpost Raided"
swiss.187.d: "An outpost in Mittelland, not responding to radio contact, was today discovered to have been attacked and raided by an unknown enemy. It is theorized the attackers were Syndicalist sympathizers, looking to arm themselves with the weapons stored at the location. The men defending the outpost were found to have been killed defending it. We must avenge their deaths."
swiss.187.a: "Scoundrels."

swiss.188.t: "Gunfire in Bern."
swiss.188.d: "Gunfire rang out in the early morning today in Bern as unidentified gunmen attempted to attack a military patrol moving through the streets. The gunmen were killed without military casualties, but the shock of the incident has rattled citizen's trust in our control of internal affairs."
swiss.188.a: "Troubling."

swiss.189.t: "Popular Support Rising"
swiss.189.d: "Our recent policy of increased military patrols and police presence have reduced crime rates dramatically across the nation, and the people are slowly coming around to the idea of our government being their protectors."
swiss.189.a: "We protect the people."

swiss.190.t: "An increase in patrols?"
swiss.190.d: "While our recent military activities have been successful in quashing resistance across the nation, especially in urban areas, it has been proposed that we increase our military presence in the more rurual regions of Switzerland as well. These are the regions most difficult to maintain order in, and it would require a significant increase in manpower to cover these areas."
swiss.190.a: "It will be done."
swiss.190.b: "Those men are better spent elsewhere."

swiss.191.t: "Fighting on the Frontier"
swiss.191.d: "Our recent decision to oust foreign agents from the nation has driven many to the frontiers to hide and work against the state. In recent days these fighters have been in numerous battles against military forces patrolling in these areas, and casualties have mounted among our forces."
swiss.191.a: "Damn them."

swiss.192.t: "The Nation Secured"
swiss.192.d: "Despite the continual efforts of Syndicalist partisans to sabotage our efforts to maintain peace and order, we have successfully identified and crushed all major sources of resistance and potential dangers to the government. With this, a new era of peace can be ushered in."
swiss.192.a: "Peace at last."

swiss.193.t: "French-Swiss flow into France"
swiss.193.d: "The rising tide of anti-French sentiment has manifested itself in recent days in a string of violence and harassment against the significant French-speaking population remaining in the nation. This divide has caused a wave of citizens to flow over the border into the French-occupied Haute-Savoie, and the military is struggling to clamp down on some of the more extreme cases of discrimination in the countryside."
swiss.193.a: "Less traitors to worry about."

swiss.194.t: "French-Swiss flow into France"
swiss.194.d: "Unable to accept the truth of a unified France under a Syndicalist regime, the reactionary government of Switzerland has begun a new campaign of persecution against the population of French-speaking Swiss still within their borders. This has resulted in a flow of migrants over the border into our nation, and many have shown an interest in taking up arms for an eventual liberation of their homeland from the reactionary menace."
swiss.194.a: "You are welcomed with open arms."

swiss.195.t: "Death of Arthur Fonjallaz"
swiss.195.d: "Early this morning, a minister in our government, Arthur Fonjallaz, was found dead. After preliminary examination, doctors have determined that he passed peacefully in his sleep. He was a truly great man who worked tirelessly for his country, and the party."
swiss.195.d_syn: "Early this morning, Arthur Fonjallaz was found dead in his home. After preliminary examination, doctors have determined that he died in his sleep. He was a dangerous reactionary politician, advocating for anti-semitism, and consistently putting himself at odds with the interests of the workers."
swiss.195.d_dem: "Early this morning, a minister in our government, Arthur Fonjallaz, was found dead. After preliminary examination, doctors have determined that he passed peacefully in his sleep. While we did not always agree with his views, he served his country in the Swiss military, and deserves to be remembered."
swiss.195.a: "We lost a good man today."
swiss.195.b: "He will not be missed."
swiss.195.c: "Give my condolences to his family."

swiss.196.t: "Death of Giuseppe Motta"
swiss.196.d: "Early this morning, the statesman Giuseppe Motta passed away. He spent his last few days in the company of his family and doctors, however he could not be cured. He was a truly great man who worked tirelessly in service and advocacy for his country, and will be remembered by many."
swiss.196.d_syn: "Early this morning, the statesman Giuseppe Motta passed away. He spent his last few days in the company of his family and doctors, however he could not be cured. While we did not agree with his views, and some of the more hardline members of our government view him as a traitor to the people, it is undeniable that he did spend a significant part of his life helping people, and that is to be respected."
swiss.196.a: "He will be missed."

swiss.197.t: "Integrating the Militias"
swiss.197.d: "Eugene Bircher and Emil Sonderegger's political militias helped us prevent syndicalist subversion before the coup, but many in the government are questioning the use of the militias now. Bircher has committed to disbanding many of the militias, however it is the choice of the government whether to simply encourage the conscription of militia personnel into our military, or to take a more direct approach."
swiss.197.a: "Accept those willing."
swiss.197.b: "These men must serve."

swiss.198.t: "Deciding our Immigration Policy"
swiss.198.d: "While Switzerland has acted liberally towards immigration in the past, the danger to our nation is too great to allow this unrestrained migration to continue. Our government has already decreed that we must address this issue; the time has come to amend our immigration policy."
swiss.198.a: "Make limited changes."
swiss.198.b: "Radically reduce immigration."
swiss.199.t: "German-Swiss Generals Flee"
swiss.199.d: "Due to the large pro-German bias that was present in the old government, most of our army was led by Swiss-Germans. However, it has become apparent that the vast majority of these high-ranking generals have fled to Germany along with the other Swiss-German refugees, too afraid to allow themselves to be judged fairly for their crimes against the Swiss people. While we may not want to admit it publicly, this loss will deliver a serious blow to our ability to operate the military effectively."
swiss.199.a: "They will not be missed."

swiss.201.t: "The Remaining Generals"
swiss.201.d: "While the majority of our generals fled after the revolution, some French-Swiss officers have opted to stay. Their remaining in Switzerland demonstrates a great level of faith and loyalty to our nation, and their experience in the army would be invaluable to our efforts to rebuild the military. However, their involvement with the old guard of the military has made their status controversial among hardline revolutionaries."
swiss.201.a: "They are traitors."
swiss.201.b: "Accept their support."
swiss.201.c: "They shall lead our armies."

swiss.203.t: "A Trippy Accident"
swiss.203.d: "Attempting to create an analeptic stimulant that had no adverse effects on women, Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman has accidentally stumbled upon genius. After learning the craft at Sandoz Laboratory in Basel, Switzerland under Biochemist and professor Arthur Stoll, Hoffman began studying ergot fungus and squill plants, and after much experimentation, he created a new hallucinogenic drug by mistake. Dubbed lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, Hoffman first synthesized it in 1938, but set the research aside for 5 years until now. Reexamining the substance, some was absorbed through his skin on his finger, and after a short period he began to feel the effects, being quoted as saying he was ‘‘affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed - for I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring - I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this condition faded away’’ after his first trip. Three days after first synthesizing this miracle drug, he intentionally ingested 250 micrograms of the substance on a day he now calls ‘Bicycle Day’ after feeling the effects kick-in while biking home from his lab, and has gone on to refine the synthesization process of LSD while being an active daily microdoser of the substance. Calling himself the first Psychonaut, Dr. Hoffman has been derided by some but applauded by many, and some believe his science will go on to change the world."
swiss.203.a: "A first step into a future unburdened by a closed mind."

### Liechtenstein Stuff ###

swiss.202.t: "Liechtenstein Asks for Protection"
swiss.202.d: "We have just received a diplomatic envoy from Principality of Liechtenstein. With the fall of the Austrian empire they are asking us for protection.\n\nThe Principality of Liechtenstein is the final remnant of the Holy Roman Empire and due to its unique geographic location has survived until now. Since 1818 they have been under the protection of Austria, first through the German Confederation and later through bi-lateral treaties.\n\nBut given Austria is defeated Liechtenstein now asks for out protection; what is our reply?"
swiss.202.a: "We would be happy to help."

swiss.209.t: "Elections to the new National Council"
swiss.209.d: "With a new National Council ruling over our Mountain Home, and with vile radicals like Oltramare defeated by the will of the people, the time for new democratic elections has arrived. A Grand Coalition of Socialists under Jules Humbert-Droz has ruled the Executive Council since its inception, however new factions have begun popping up. Fritz Platten has come to lead a faction of Jacobins and other Communists, and despite being authoritarians, are far separated from Oltramare’s like, and are unlikely to try and dissolve the Swiss System that has been created. Another faction is Jacob Herzog’s Centralized Syndicalists, a coalition of former Anarcho-Syndicalists which has shifted to a more authoritarian position with time. The final faction in contention is led by current President Humbert-Droz, who has begun shifting towards a ‘Market Socialist’ position after being influenced by figures such as Nikolai Bukharin. "
swiss.209.a: "Platten and the Communist Faction wins."
swiss.209.b: "The Syndicalist Grand Coalition Holds."
swiss.209.c: "Herzog's Authoritarian Syndicalist faction wins."
swiss.209.e: "Humbert-Droz's Market Socialist faction wins."

SWI_peace_mission_ongoing: "Maintain Peace in Haute-Savoie"
SWI_peace_mission_ongoing_desc: "With a sudden increase in French activists rallying against our mandated occupation of Haute-Savoie, the Commune of France is no doubt involved, and seeking to inflame anti-Swiss sentiment in the region.

SWI_Savoie_decisions: "The Fate of Haute-Savoie"
SWI_Savoie_decisions_desc: "Since the collapse of the French Republic, Switzerland has maintained a military occupation of Haute-Savoie to fulfil their mandate of maintaining neutrality in the region.

### Monarchy Path ###
SWI_funni_monarchism: "Birth of Swiss Monarchism"
SWI_funni_monarchism_desc: "With 1936 dawning, we must accept the harsh reality we are faced with - Republicanism is a failed ideology. This truth has been proved both in our council chambers and in the fires of the Weltkrieg, showing our tiny nation the light of monarchism as the Kaiser marched to victory. With many believing that a second war is on the horizon, we must prepare ourselves for the coming storm, and what better way to prepare than to establish a monarchy, finally bringing prestige, stability, and order in these trying times?"
SWI_crown_willy: "Crown Wilhelm II"
SWI_crown_willy_desc: "In our quest for a monarch, what better man is there than the Kaiser himself, the victor of the Great War? Switzerland is a Germanic nation, and we deserve a Germanic King!"
SWI_crown_karl: "Crown Karl I"

SWI_crown_eddie: "Crown Edward VIII"
SWI_crown_eddie_desc: "If any man is fit to rule Switzerland, surely it is the exiled King of England, Edward, is it not? Though he and his father may have lost their throne in London, the Anglos will have a second shot at glory here."
SWI_crown_krill: "Crown Kirill I"

SWI_crown_krill_desc: "Kirill I, claimant to the vacant Romanov throne, is surely the most fitting man for the new Swiss throne. After all, a little experience in leadership would help him in Russia greatly, should he ever reclaim his birthright."
SWI_enternal_regency: "Eternal Regency"
SWI_enternal_regency_desc: "If we are being honest, no man is fit to rule our fair lands, thus the regency shall endure indefinitely. We shall build monarchism without a monarch, no matter how stupid that seems."
SWI_abolish_monarchy: "Abolish the Monarchy"
SWI_abolish_monarchy_desc: "Despite our best efforts, the Monarchy has done nothing but bring chaos and instability to our little mountain home. To remedy this ailment, the monarchy shall be torn down, the throne destroyed, and any traces of regality and nobility eradicated. The Republic shall be born anew from this ash, ready to guide the Swiss people into modernity."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_DUKE_ROBERTO_DESC:0 "Roberto D'Asburgo-Este, Archduke of Austria, was promised while he was still an infant the position of Duke of Modena. He never even set foot in his duchy, as it was one of the first places where Federal forces were forced to withdraw from during the chaotic Civil War in Italy. The second son of Karl I, Roberto grew up in Austria alongside the royal family, and despite having learned Italian, seldom thought about his duties as head of the house of Austria-Este for most of his life. But now, he is Duke, and few can argue that his position isn't exactly enviable, as recovering the land ravaged by Syndicalism while having to deal with a brand new political landscape, having essentially no political experience, is quite the daunting task."
POLITICS_DUKE_ELIAS_DESC:0 "Born in 1880, Elias of Bourbon-Parma has never sat on a throne, for like most monarchs of the Federation, he never was in a position to return during the turmoil of the war on the wake of the Treaty of Rome. Having lived in exile in family estates for most of his life, he was forced to leave his birthplace in France following the Revolution, but even before that the French state harried his family for their ties to Austria-Hungary during the Weltkrieg. While he technically acted as a regent for his demented brothers, Elias has been long the de-facto head of the house, and his ascension to the throne of the now restored throne is little more than a fait-accompli of dynastic politics. However, there is no shortage of criticism for what some see as brazen ambition being put ahead of his own brother's well being."

### Focuses ###
EMI_ducal_army:0 "A National Army"
EMI_ducal_army_desc:0 "After years of turmoil and socialist mismanagement, the Emilia region is economically ruined. While the might of our foreign allies have imparted a small degree of stability on the region, to maintain order and defend our nation, we must begin to create a domestic army."

EMI_guardi_apenini:0 "Guardia Appennina"

### Events ###
emi.2.t:0 "The Appennini"
emi.2.d:0 "The rough terrain of much of our homeland is irregular and often confusing to outsiders and may well be our best defence against a larger invading force. Old Partisan veterans from the war against the SRI have come together and formed our very own mountaineer regiments, the Appennini, who will dutifully defend our western borders."
emi.2.a:0 "The best of the best!"

emi.3.t:0 "Lost Ways"
emi.3.d:0 "Many of our old crafts and specialities have lost much to the syndicalists. Especially affected are cheese and wine makers, whose workshops were often vandalised by 'futurists' who saw their craft as decadent. Our utmost effort should be to help re-establish this important aspect of our culture."
emi.3.a:0 "We must try to preserve our traditions!"

emi.4.t:0 "Enzo Ferrari's Popularity Grows"
emi.4.d:0 "A chief captain of industry and community leader, Enzo Ferrari has done much since he arrived after the end of occupation from Syndicalists. Sensing opportunity, but also a genuine desire to help his home rebuild, his efforts to develop Modena are nothing short of remarkable, and he surely will be a political force in our nation in the future."
emi.4.a:0 "He's a symbol of the modern Modena"

emi.5.t:0 "The Archduke and his People"
emi.5.d:0 "As the years go by, Roberto more and more grows accustomed to his role as Duke and as the leader of his people. Having embraced his role as the first citizen of Emilia, Duke of Modena and all that entails, his outlook on things seems to be more trusting and relaxed than during his early years, when he was afraid of the land who rejected him after the Weltkrieg. Now he finds himself speaking Italian confidently, and ever more frequently, as so do his kids and household. His popularity rises as he continually tries to appear publicly in the streets of Modena, and seems genuinely interested in the nation he was born to rule."
emi.5.a:0 "As it was meant to be"

emi.6.t:0 "A Dictionary of the Emilian Language!"
emi.6.d:0 "The University of Parma has just yesterday published the first formal dictionary of the Emilian Language, cataloguing centuries of cultural and national legacy which almost was trampled by Savoyard and syndicalist ambitions. While it's a long way from replacing Standard Italian among most, a revival of the language may now begin starting with our youth."
emi.6.a:0 "Bòn!"

emi.7.t:0 "Fierce Debate at the Academy"
emi.7.d:0 "Our status as being home to one of europe's finest military academies means we often have visitors from abroad, bringing with them ideas and concepts, but also strong opinions. Inevitably, large debates emerge, especially now that the military has chosen one way to prioritize one army doctrine over other possible views. The topic of this choice has long dominated the academy classrooms and hallways and is sure to bring improvements."
emi.7.a:0 "Many great minds at work"

emi.8.t:0 "Barilla's Factories Back at Full Capacity"
emi.8.d:0 "As our program to get foodstuff factories up and running is now at full steam, Barilla's pasta factories finally are back at full capacity, after severe vandalism by 'futurist' thugs under SRI occupation. Despite the initial despair of the owners upon seeing what was left of the buildings a year ago, we finally have one of our premier industries back on track."
emi.8.a:0 "Mussolini never could have stopped us!"

emi.9.t:0 "The Ducal Marriage"
emi.9.d:0 "Duke Roberto has today married in the Modena Cathedral princess Margherita of Sardinia, a long agreed match between the two families that was postponed for many years of this cruel war in Italy. The festivities help to lighten the mood in the city that still recovers from decades of war and terror."
emi.9.a:0 "Until Death do them Part"

emi.10.t:0 "The Firstborn"
emi.10.d:0 "Duke Roberto and Princess Margherita had their first daughter born in Modena today. Young Maria Beatrice is healthy as it can be, and the birth brought great joy to the Ducal household, and to the common people too as a nation wide Holiday was declared."
emi.10.a:0 "Great News!"

emi.11.t:0 "An Heir Arrives!"
emi.11.d:0 "Duke Roberto and Princess Margherita had their first son born in Modena today. Young Lorenzo's labour was painless, and the birth brought great joy to the Ducal household, and yet another holiday was declared for the momentous occasion."
emi.11.a:0 "Great News!"

emi.12.t:0 "The Duchy of Parma"
emi.12.d:0 "As the House of Bourbon restores order to Italy as a whole, the Duchy of Parma was reinstated as the chief power in the region of Emilia. Duke Elias is now in charge of leading our nation to its prosperous future."
emi.12.a:0 "Sorbole!"

### Events ###
eurasia.1.t:0 "Birth of the Eurasian Union"
eurasia.1.d:0 "The regular Duma session has come to an end. The deputies were returning home to their families. Today was a really long day, full of work and routine.\n\nBut in the Tauride Palace there was a light in the single window. There were 5 men in suits in the room, seeting at the long table made of oak: Georgy Vernadskiy and Pyotr Savitskiy were sitting next to each other and conversing in whisper. Opposite to them there was sitting Prince Mirskiy, looking thoughtfully at some papers on the table. Next to him there was Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov, who was sitting silently. At the head of the table there was Prince Trubetzkoy - the leader of the Eurasianist Party, the prime-minister.\n\nFinally, the latter said: 'It's time to start our meeting...'"
eurasia.1.a:0 "A silent night in Petrograd."

eurasia.100.t:0 "The Flag of the Eurasian Union"
eurasia.100.d:0 "As we have officially created the Eurasian Union the matter of the flag has come to our attention, with two designs being proposed. \nThe first design is a blue banner with a red stripe at the bottom, above it is a white circle with the symbol of our Union in the middle. \nThe other design is more simple, a blue field with the symbol of the Eurasian Union in gold centered in the middle. Both of these designs have their perks, but we must settle on one."
eurasia.100.a:0 "Go with the first design, it looks best."
eurasia.100.b:0 "The second design is more simple and looks more appealing."

eurasia.2.t:0 "An Opportunity?"
eurasia.2.d:0 "Prince Shikhmatov has suddenly abrupted Prince Trubetzkoy.\n'We should not miss the chance. The future lies in our hands.' - he stated.\n'Calm down, Yuri' - Prince Trubetzkoy said nervously. A Rittmeister, who sat in front of him, was a burden for the majority of those present.\nHe was not considered a true Eurasianist, despite being one of its leaders. He was always considered an outsider - a person with strange reputation and biography. His father was the Chamberlain of the Highest Court, full State Councilor, Chief Prosecutor of the Holy Synod, senator, member of the State Council, participant of the monarchist movement in Russia. No wonder his son had such great ambitions.\n\n'Perhaps, Yuriis right.' - Savitskiy interupted the silence, - 'With our principles implemented in life, with the Duma and the Senate fully supporting us, we are avoir les mains libres.'\n\n'Don't you undestand, Pyetr!' - Trubetzkoy exclaimed. - 'You are speaking of dangerous things. The public won't understand. The opposition won't understand. Moreover, the opposition won't accept it.'\n\n'Who cares, Nikolai Sergeevich? Do you really think the army won't support us? All these monarchists, conservators - they will support everything we do, if it is against the socialists'."
eurasia.2.a:0 "There is something in the wind..."

eurasia.3.t:0 "The Turning-Point"
eurasia.3.d:0 "'Enough!' - Shikhmatov swept out of the room, leaving the others in silence.\n'His ambitions are out of control.' - Mirskiy said the very first word at the meeting. - 'Don't be mad. Do you remember who his father was? His organisation is marginal and without any support. That's why he's among Eurasianists. We should not pay much attention to his words.'\n\n'I'm leaving too' - Mirskiy muttered.\nThree friends, three founders of the Eurasianist ideology were left alone."
eurasia.3.a:0 "Let's go home."

eurasia.4.t:0 "The Black Horse"
eurasia.4.d:0 "'I'm listening.'\nBoris Savinkov was sitting cross-legged in his chair. It was hard to say whether he was showing a real interest in Shikhmatov's plea or just was pretending.\n'Boris Viktorovich, I am here to ask for you support. The support of the paramilitaries, perhaps, some finances as well.\n'So why should I be interested?' - Savinkov replied calmly.\n'We are fighting for the future of our Motherland, Boris Viktorovich. We need this victory. With the support of NRPR, I can expect that the Council will listen. They should listen.'\n\n'Stop it, Yuri Alekseevich. We both know that is not true. You are driven by a desire to have power. Huge amount of power. Don't you think I am not right?'\n\nShikhmatov stood silently for a minute. He believed passionately in his own ideals, his desire to create a true Orthodox Eurasia was as much as his desire to own any power. A minute passed. Shikhmatov looked at the Vozhd; his face was without any emotions, with tightened lips and pursy eyes.\n'So, can I reckon on your support?'\n\nSavinkov answered with a frosty look..."
eurasia.4.a:0 "'We have common goals'"
eurasia.4.c:0 "'I cannot promise anything.'"

eurasia.5.t:0 "A Council Of Three"
eurasia.5.d:0 "It was a quiet, yet pluvious morning in Petrograd. Savitskiy, Trubetzkoy and Vernadskiy were sitting at the terrace, drinking coffee and recalling the previous night.\n\n'Do you think Shikhmatov will act?' - Trubetzkoy asked.\n\n'My friend, you are too worried about this freak.' - Savitskiy replied. - 'He is nobody. He has no support and we are the only who he can rely on. Without us he will quickly lose all the remaining support among Eurasianists.'\n\n'Perhaps you are right. But I cannot stop thinking about his words. Great Eurasia. Revolution. What was our political struggle for? We supposed to be intellectuals, the new philosophers, founders of the new political thought, not radicals or extremists.'\n\n'But we can't be just a handful of senators like in the old days, can we, Nikolai?.."
eurasia.5.a:0 "Maybe it's better to discuss Mirskiy?'"

eurasia.6.t:0 "The Red Prince"
eurasia.6.d:0 "'Mirskiy is said to have some socialist sentiments recently.' - Savitskiy claimed.\n\n'It can be just rumours, Pyetr. We know him for a long time - he's not like this.'\n\n'I understand your skepticism, Nikolai. But his friendship with Sergei Efron and Lev Karsavin...'\n\n'Alright, Pyetr.'\n\nTrubetzkoy was looking meditatively at the panorama of Neva River. He also had some concerns about Mirskiy. Recently he's been too tight lipped and melancholic. Perhaps the rumors are right, but that means that some action should be done. Trubetzkoy continued:"
eurasia.6.b:0 "'We should spy upon him'"
eurasia.6.c:0 "'We should leave him alone'"

eurasia.7.t:0 "Dear, Friend"
eurasia.7.d:0 "I am writing to you in what you know a greatly unstable times. There are some movements in the party. Shikhmatov thinks about a coup and installing an autocratic rule of the party. The triumvirate keep their eyes and ears open. It will be hard for us to do anything, only if there is a chance. Your help... it is not enough I suppose. We have no equipment to defend ourselves. I am going to contact someone in Russia.\n\nLook out, they can spy upon us. The face-to-face meetings are now too dangerous. That's why I am writing to you. I am waiting for your reply."
eurasia.7.a:0 "Sincerely, D.P. The Red Prince." 

eurasia.8.t:0 "Tovarisch Volsky"
eurasia.8.d:0 "'I am glad to hear this from you, Dmitri.' - Volsky smiled. The former leader of the KOMUCH seemed to feel quite joyful when Mirskiy asked for his support. With the PSR being a leading political ideologue of Narodism, the ideas of Mirskiy applied to the views of Volsky quite accurately. The very idea of a truly Narodist Russia has been seen as a remedy in the eyes of an old party leader. The peasantry that will finally take the place in the society it deserves. Volsky added:"
eurasia.8.a:0 "'But what about Spiridonova?'"

eurasia.9.t:0 "Ice Cracked"
eurasia.9.d:0 "All of the quintuple were sitting in silence. The split became too evident for them, but perhaps nobody realised the real scale of tragedy. At least, Trubetzkoy could do nothing with the split. The founders of a new ideology, of a new world order had nothing to do, but accept the current state of affairs.\n\nThere will be struggle. Eternal struggle for power. Eurasianism would have definetely be at the crossroads between nationalism and cosmopolitanism, but who would imagine it back in the days? The others fell under the uncontrolable influence of the socialism. If they even understand what the Orthodox Eurasianism gave them, if they don't underestimate the ideocracy we have created. Perhaps, it was all vain."
eurasia.9.a:0 "We should openly announce the party split."
eurasia.9.b:0 "We'd better not show our vulnerability."

eurasia.10.t:0 "The Party Splits"
eurasia.10.d:0 "'The Eurasianist Party has finally put a halt to the rumors about the split in the party.' - was the heading of a fresh newspaper Trubetzkoy was holding in his hands. Perhaps, the open announcement of the split in the party at the Duma session has brought even more concern and problems. Now the authority of the party is shaken. This can be harmful for the future elections as well. But, on the other hand, as Trubetzkoy reflected, the split opens new opportunities - a new political struggle for the Orthodox Eurasianists that should show to the country that they are still strong and ready to fight."
eurasia.10.a:0 "We need a plan."

eurasia.11.t:0 "The Eurasianist Party Congress Announced"
eurasia.11.d:0 "Trubetskoy has announced the extraordinary party congress as what he mediated will be the turning point in the future of the Eurasianist party. At the congress, the delegates from the PLE, led by Mirskiy; National-Maximalists, led by Shikhmatov; and himself, accompanied by Savitskiy and Vernadskiy will present the new party programme for the rest of the Eurasianist party members. After that, the democratic decision will be made: a new party leadership appointed and a new party programme adopted."
eurasia.11.a:0 "The Democracy will always win."

eurasia.12.t:0 "Silence the Opposition"
eurasia.12.d:0 "Even if the party split was a secret, more and more people are becoming treasurers of this secret. The newspapers write about the split in the ruling party according to 'the information from insiders'.\n\nBut it is time to act now. The opposition to the 'Main Party Line' shall be silenced. Neither Mirskiy nor Shikhmatov have the influence we do. We must use any chance to crack down on violations and nip in the bud all attempts to overthrow current party leadership."
eurasia.12.b:0 "Focus on National-Maximalists."
eurasia.12.a:0 "Focus on Left Eurasianists."

eurasia.13.t:0 "Doctrine of Single Ideology"
eurasia.13.d:0 "One of the leaders of the Eurasianist Party, Georgy Vernadsky has delivered a speech on the party congress about the unity and single ideological agenda made obligatory for all party delegates.\n\nIn this act of authoritarian tendencies inside the Party, the leadership tries to silence the internal opposition to the main policies of the Eurasianists. With the split in the party into leftists, centrists and rightists, this act was seen as a deliberate necessity. With the attempts to silence the opposition, Vernadsky tries to restore order in the party, what he calls 'Putting an end to the eternal vain discourses about the party programme and suppressing destabilizing elements that causing the split within the party.'"
eurasia.13.a:0 "Let us hope this helps."

eurasia.14.t:0 "Shikhmatov and Mirskiy Criticize the Doctrine"
eurasia.14.d:0 "The recent doctrine, adopted at the party congress has caused large discontent among the party delegates, especially ones from the left and the right. While the Doctrine has defenitely undermined attitudes of the 'destabilizing elements', they are becoming ready to act more vigorously.\n\nEven if the left and right opposition are still to weak to declare their withdrawal from the party and the list of their supporters being too small, the critics say that the Doctrine of Single Ideology could have caused even more split than it originally planned to supress."
eurasia.14.a:0 "Better for all of us."

eurasia.15.t:0 "Union of National-Maximalists"
eurasia.15.d:0 "The recent week was not easy for Yuri. He had to solve major problems, perhaps the most compex ones in his whole life. It was a difficult choice that he had to make. His dissent from traditional Eurasianist doctrine and current party policies drive him to take a decision to leave the party, followed by his confederates.\n\nWith Shikhmatov's defection from the Eurasianist party and the re-establishement of the Union of Russian National-Maximalists he has finally and forevermore severed his ties with other members of the Eurasianist Party. But the decision was made. It is rather him or them. Power or suppression. Liberty or prison. What shall he do next? He had a plan. If the debate cannot be solved by peace and words, it will be solved by war and arms."
eurasia.15.a:0 "The power struggle begins."

eurasia.16.t:0 "Party of Left Eurasianists"
eurasia.16.d:0 "Mirskiy was on firm ground. He was standing before his supporters. The First Congress of the PLE, Party of the Left Eurasianists has just ended. A political programme, lineup of the Central Committee was decided on. After the Shikhmatov's withdrawal and establishment of the SRNM he has nothing to do, but proclaim his own political power. The new party was supported by some of the socialist parties, and it is said that even the Left SRs have installed close ties with the new party."
eurasia.16.a:0 "Socialist Eurasianists?"

eurasia.17.t:0 "Leftist Propaganda"
eurasia.17.d:0 "With the establishement of the Party of Left Eurasianists, the ideology of socialism and Eurasian-wide narodism has spread throughout the country, and, what is most important, amongst the delegates of the Eurasianist party. The socialist ideals are becoming more and more appeal with the propaganda in the mass media. Without any chance to silence the opposition, we must, therefore, increase our efforts to promote Orthodox Eurasianism."
eurasia.17.a:0 "The truth is in Orthodox Eurasianism."

eurasia.18.t:0 "The Rightists Unite"
eurasia.18.d:0 "Perhaps, the charisma of the leader of the rightist Eurasianists has been decisive in promoting the party's ideology. Moreover, with the support of the NRPR, the National-Maximalist influence is spreading quicker. We must do something to persuade the delegates of the Congress to stay away from radicalism and support us."
eurasia.18.a:0 "Shikhmatov is becoming more pretentious."

eurasia.19.t:0 "The Eurasianist Party Congress Begins..."
eurasia.19.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, it is time to start our session. Most of you understand why this Congress is necessary. There is a serious split in the party, what is more, the split cannot be resolved by building a strong coalition, invulnerable to external enemies and internal ideological disagreements...'\n\nTrubetzkoy stopped. He did not stumbled over words. Either he did not knew what to say next. This momentary pause revealed the real emotions of the party leader - his face expressed sorrow. This Congress, which will become history in the future is about to put an end to the Eurasianist party he knew. The party, which arose from an idea that Russia can be strong - that it should be strong. The unique cultural and political environment, unequalled heroism of the Russian people and reborn Slavophilia in contrast to the Kaiser-appeasing previous government."
eurasia.19.a:0 "Are you alright, Mr. Trubetzkoy?"

eurasia.20.t:0 "The Interlude"
eurasia.20.d:0 "'We have gathered togerther today to elect the new leadership of the party.' - Trubetzkoy continued.\n\n'Being totally faithful in the ideals of the Eurasianist democracy, the only solution to the crisis in the party that I see is through election. At the current session we are going to listen to the delegates from the party fractions.\n\nI will present the speakers. Prince Dmitri Petrovich Mirskiy will speak on behalf of the Left Eurasian fraction. Yuri Alekseevich Shikhmatov will present the political programme, suggested by the National-Maximalist. On behalf of the current leadership Mr. Vernadsky will speak.\n\nThank you for your attention."
eurasia.20.a:0 "Let's move on."

eurasia.21.t:0 "The Red Prince"
eurasia.21.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, with gratitude to Mr. Trubetzkoy, I may proceed with the agenda of the meeting. I respect the decision of the party leadership to give me the floor to speak. On behalf of the Russian people, peasants and workers of the Eurasian Union, I will present the new party programme, developed by the leading experts in the economic and political spheres. Based on the theoretical assumptions of myself, the Union shall endorse its strength in the majority of its population. By completely destroying the foundations of our society - the Russian people we risk to fall again under the influence of the West. Enslaved by the Kaiser, soured by misfortunes of the tainted Western Capitalism, our nation has lacked unity and strength in achieving its goals. By giving the power to the peasants and workers, the Union will endure forever.\n\nThe new Age is coming. The Prussian Eagle is dying before the swords and torches of the international proletariat. I dare to assure you, the esteemed members of the Congress, that the future is in our hands. In hands of a strong Eurasia, driven by the ideas of narodism and socialism..."
eurasia.21.a:0 "He seems to flatter his knowledge."

eurasia.22.t:0 "The Rittmeister"
eurasia.22.d:0 "The final of Mirskiy's speech was accompanied by uncovered enmity and general discontent of the Congress members, especially the National-Maximalists. He was supported by a group of his confederates, who applauded. The presentation of the so-called Red Prince was over.\n\nYuri Shikhmatov, standing before the Congress has begun his speech.\n\n'Esteemed members of the Congress, I am glad that the National-Maximalists were given the floor to speak after this disreputable act, performed by the leftist delegation of Left Eurasianists. The National-Maximalists protest vigorously against the suggestions of Mr. Mirskiy to turn our great Union to a bulwark of international socialism. What I want to highlight is the determination, with which Mirskiy has stated his mock-scientific image of Russian people, and what is most important - Eurasian nation.\n\nThe National-Maximalists are greatly disillusioned by the decision of Mr. Trubetzkoy to even give the opportunity of this absolutely anti-Eurasianist internationalist group of opposition to perform at the Congress...'\n\nShikhmatov continued his ardent speech about the everlasting dishonour of the Left Eurasianistm and flabbiness of the current Eurasianist leadership or whatever. Trubetzkoy was not listening. He was lost in reflection about the decision he had made. Was it right to give the floor to all these ignoramuses? He felt the responsibility before the Congress for what he had just did. Perhaps, it should have been better to silence the opposition and promote unity of the party? Who knows?\n\n'Mr. Vernadsky, before you speak..."
eurasia.22.a:0 "Convince the Congressmen that they are mistaken...'"

eurasia.23.t:0 "The Founding Father"
eurasia.23.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, I would like to begin my speech with telling you the following. A decade ago, when me, Mr. Trubetzkoy, Mr. Savitskiy and Mr. Jakobson became the founding fathers of a new revolutionary doctrine - a single idea that the Russian nation can be strong - can be powerful, can be sovereign. From this single idea a new movement was born. A movement that finally won. And I dare to disagree with Mr. Shikhmatov. We are all greatly disillusioned that the Congress has to waste time on discussing the ideas that contradict the basis of the Eurasianist ideology. Neither the Left Eurasianists nor the National-Maximalists are Eurasianists in any sense of this word. Our movement is anti-nationalist and anti-internationalist. We are here to create the new national identity. We are here to create the new ideocracy. But we are here not to create something new - we are here to tell the truth about us, about our origins and about our future. The creation of the Eurasian Union was envisioned by us long before we first appeared in Duma. It is a natural process and we are here to ensure that this process will be stable and will pass without let or hindrance. We all have listened to the performances of Mr. Mirskiy and Mr. Shikhmatov. Their ideas are quite clear and can find reflection in preferences of the Congress members and Russian citizens. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with Eurasianism. And I appeal to everyone, do not make a false step by making nonsense of the Eurasianism. Keep it in mind when you will vote for the new leadership."
eurasia.23.a:0 "A passionate speech!"

eurasia.24.t:0 "The Voting Begins"
eurasia.24.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, I am glad that we have listened to all the delegates and all the opinions presented today. Now I announce the beginning of the voting. Thank you.'\n\nTrubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy have gone into executive session, leaving the Congress in a state of stormy discussion. The decision was about to be made."
eurasia.24.a:0 "The beginning of a new Era."

eurasia.25.t:0 "New Party Leadership Elected"
eurasia.25.d.orth:0 "While the Congress was voting for the new party leadership, Trubetzkoy and Vernadskiy were discussing the other, the last but not least topic: what to do next? While being confident that the majority of the Congress members are still... sane, they were mediating about the future if a catastrophe is present. What if the Congress members will listen to Mirskiy, or believe in Shikhmatov's schizophrenia?\n\nAn hour passed and the Eurasianist leaders still had no idea. They could just leave the country to escape from possible persecution. They could stay and take charge of resistance to the radicals.\n\nBut suddenly their thoughts were interrupted. It was Roman Jakobson, a close friend of Trubetskoy and Vernadsky.\n\n'The voting has ended.'\n\nWith Trubetzkoy and Vernadskiy returning into the hall, the results were announced. The Congress votes for..."
eurasia.25.d.left:0 "Mirskiy was uncertain if his faction will become victorous. Moreover, he feared the persecution that will follow if he lost. An obvious expulsion from the party, hiding underground or moving to the Commune or perhaps, arrest and trial for treason. He tried to convince himself in otherwise. He had a lot of supporters amongst the socialist groups in Russia. The Congress does not completely comprise anti-socialists. He turned to his comrade, Sergey Efron to express his anxiety when suddenly Trubetzkoy and Vernadskiy returned into the hall. The results were to be announced. The Congress votes for..."
eurasia.25.d.young:0 "Yuri Shikhmatov, accompanied by fellow National-Maximalists was always confident in his actions. He knew that the truth was behind his back. Moreover, he was supported by many Congress members and even more influential figures, like Savinkov. He was waiting with patience for the results. The time waxed on, while the votes were still counted. He was not thinking about the consequences if he loses. The National-Maximalist movement dissolved? Himself arrested? He did nothing wrong. Suddenly, Trubetzkoy and Vernadskiy returned. The results were to be announced. The Congress votes for..."
eurasia.25.a:0 "Maintaining the current leadership."
eurasia.25.b:0 "Left Eurasianists."
eurasia.25.c:0 "National-Maximalists."

eurasia.26.t:0 "Radicalization of the Society"
eurasia.26.d:0 "The society is becoming more and more radicalized with the Left Eurasianists and National-Maximalists gaining support amongst the Eurasianist Party members and populace. Prince Mirskiy, supported by various socialist groups and Shikhmatov, supported by the NRPR are threatening Eurasian democracy. We should now act with decision if we want to secure our rule."
eurasia.26.a:0 "The real battle begins..."

eurasia.27.t:0 "First Strikes!"
eurasia.27.d:0 "The large industrial centers of the country report workers' strikes at plants. This can be undoubtedly recognized as the actions of the Left Eurasianist party, which seek to destabilize the society and our government. We can ignore it or crush the protesters."

All of extremists belong either to the Left Eurasianists or National-Maximalists. They steal the weapons from the army storehouses or get them through the black market, which can be explained by an unprecedented act of official venality. Moreover, those who have initiated this illegal actions share responsibility similar in nature to frank-pledge, so the investigation can possibly show nothing and the guilty ones will remain out of prison."

A large strike that targeted the main industrial factory in the country in order to press for governmental action.\n\nTrubetzkoy has been sitting in the Tauride Palace. An emergency council was convened in order to solve the current situation. He was accompanied by the supreme party leadership, consisting of Savitskiy, Vernadskiy, Chkheidze and Jakobson. The council has also invited the supreme Commander-in-Chief, Lavr Kornilov if the army support to disperse the strike will become essential.\n\n'Esteemed members of the Council, we are here to discuss the Putilov plant strike that is currently damaging the stability of the Union and is leading to further radicalization of the society. As reported, the strike is organized by the Left Eurasianist Party with the support of the socialist parties, including PLSR, NSP, RSDRP and PSR. The chance to succeed is debatable, but possibly high if we just disperse the workers, perhaps with the support of the army officers and the police. On the other hand, in case of our failure, the strike can spread to the other plants and cities, leading to an economic collapse, the consequences of which can be severe for our stability. Any ideas or suggestions, my most esteemed colleagues?'\n\nThe majority of the council has agreed with Trubetzkoy, except for Savitskiy, who was also supported by Kornilov. He insisted on a more radical way of suppressing the socialist opposition, arresting the leaders and imposing a state of emergency until the socialist resistance will be completely eradicated."

The workers of the Putilov plant were soon supported by the socialist paramilitaries of the Left Eurasianists who arrived soon and engaged in fight with National-Maximalists. Whether the sides were equal in strength, the Left Eurasianists, accompanied by the striking workers have outweighed the nationalists. The arrived police and army could do nothing as their strength was not enough.\n\nSoon after the National-Maximalists were defeated, some of them dead or escaped, the radicals tried to seize the Tauride Palace, where the emergency council was held. Almost at the same time Shikhmatov was arrested under a mandate of the council, which led to the final defeat of the National-Maximalist movement today.\n\nThe Tauride Palace was soon seized by the protesters, that were led by Prince Mirsky, Shirinsky-Shikhmatov and paramilitaries led by Sergei Efron. The council was soon arrested and detained. Red Prince has declared the transition of power to the workers and peasants of the Left Eurasianist party with the new government formed."

Yuri Shikhmatov has also escaped the justice with nobody revealing his current position. It seems that with these events though the rule of the Eurasianist Party was secured, it as well made the regime more authocratic.

They could have lost this fight, if Kornilov wasn't on their side. To a great surprise of the Eurasianist leadership, he personally arrested the emergency council.

ortheurasia.1.t:0 "The New Age"
ortheurasia.1.d:0 "Trubetzkoy entered the hall, quickly glancing around the crowded room and plumped down on the only available chair. In fact, it was not a random chair - it was the chair of the leader of the Eurasianist party.\n\nThe Dust has settled. The leaders of the opposition on the inner circles have been either arrested or escaped the country. The rule of the Eurasianists was secured and now the actual reforms and transformation of the Russian Society can be achieved. Trubetzkoy greeted the supporters. The whole admiring concourse gazed on him. Trubetzkoy, though being a significant politician, who was now in charge of the whole country has never adored his popularity. He was rather a modest person, who believed that he was a scientist in the first place.\n\nHe now had some time to look over the crowd. It was the Intelligentsia at its best: the former and the incumbent Senators, professional and famous scientists, including Vladimir Zvorykin, a pioneer of the television, Igor and Boris Kurchatovs, leading nuclear researchers. There were also various musicians, artists and composers, including Igor Stravinsky, member of the Eurasianist Party, who had just returned from Germany, and Dmitri Shostakovich, the rising composer. Rurik Ivnev and Anatoliy Mariengof amused the crowd, reciting verses. The banquet was about to start.\n\nCloser to Trubetzkoy his closest associates were sitting: Pyetr Savitskiy and Georgiy Vernadskiy with his father. A little further Konstantin Chkheidze was standing, accompanied by Felix Yusupov, Dmitri Romanov and Vasily Shulgin. Finally, Trubetzkoy's eye lighted on a familiar faces of Roman Jakobson and Pyetr Suvchinskiy, who were tackling a subject."

ortheurasia.2.d:0 "When the loud noises of the just finished party has finally stopped, there were 5 of them in the room left. Trubetzkoy's mind has drifted towards the recent papst. Was it a sudden inspiration or memory? He remembered when one silent night in Petrograd there were also 5 of them together, discussing some more important stuff than a new symphony of Shostakovich. He tried to dismiss this obsessive thought. At least, he composed himself, the two radicals have vanished from the politics and now I am surrounded by like-minded men.\n\nIt was not so in the reality. The new Council of Five, which now included Jakobson and Chkheidze was a far more diverse club than Trubetzkoy could imagine. But this time they had to cooperate somehow - yield ground and talk. A new insurgency is stictly prohibited - and all of them knew it.\n\nAll of them respected Trubetzkoy's authority and unconditional leadership but at the same time they knew Trubetzkoy's failings and his modest character. Every one of them wanted their piece of pie, and if they wanted their intiatives to be promoted, they had to sacrifice something - perhaps, the overall party stability."

The Bolshevist and SR propaganda, that perverted the minds of common people with fairy tales of Marx and Engels, has destroyed the legitimacy of socialism in the world, that led to the final failure of the Bolshevist plot.\n\nOur party of Eurasianists has brought the new ideology into life - the ideology of free people, willing to become as educated as scientists, as rich as aristocrats and to become proud bearers of the new nation.\n\nLet us throw off the shackles of the past. Let us listen to the intellectuals - to those, who know represent all the best our nations has. Let the politicians lead you to the brightness of the future. Let the new social class evolve - every Russian should belong to intelligentsia: recite modern Russian poetry, listen to the flourishing Russian Classical music, bear in mind the covenants of the past, learn the history of our nation as it is - from the genesis of Russian statehood on the foundation of Mongol Overlordship..."

The political programme of Eurasianists, that promised anti-German and anti-syndicalist foreign policy, prosperity to all the social classes, the increased role of the Orthodox Church have not brought any clarity to the minds of common citizens. They just knew that Eurasianists offered something new and something that will make the state of Russia protected and strong.\n\nNeither had they time nor ability to read long and abstruse articles and books of Trubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy. While seeming too esoteric and mock-scientific for the ones, the ideas of Eurasianists at the same time seemed reasonable and gifted them with an almost tangible sense of unity with the history. While the Eurasianist programme of Enlightenment is already full-scale, many of the citizens and children at school being taught the origins of Eurasianism, everything is becoming more and more clear. The process of nation-building has begun - the process of 'Eurasianisation' of the whole Russian population - if the Ideocracy works - the greatest experiment we have ever witnessed will tell."

With the successful internalization of Eurasianism by many Russian citizens, the Party has decided to adopt the new ID System and widely expanding it so that now every single citizen will receive formal personality identification. By issuing new Eurasian passports to every citizen, we can ensure that they can move around the country, protected by the law and the police and be treated as equal. The new Eurasian passport will mention citizenship of '[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]' and the 'Eurasian' nationality for everyone.

It was almost 20 years ago, when he was younger and more ambitious. Now, after many months of being the head of the government, Trubetzkoy was really tired. Moreover, he was not feeling as ambitious as his party associates who were or pretended to be as vigorous as earlier.\n\nTrubetzkoy has lost his unshakable authority over the Eurasianist Party, but he did everything he could to ensure our victory. He has won the elections and has been a highly proficient prime-minister during all this time.

The ones stated that we should not move away from the Orthodox Eurasianist doctrine, but the others believed in Chkheidze's theses. With Chkheidze's authority being rather high, his proposal is likely to be passed by the majority of the Senate.

Many of the Eurasianist pioneers believe that there should be no ideological diversity in the party with staying as close to the initial course as possible.

All underground anti-Eurasianist activites are suppressed and people are generally in favour of our rule. However, there are still people who threaten our Motherland from abroad. After they tried to seize the power, Mirskiy and Shikhmatov left the country, though still being active. While no real suppression of their supporters have been ever implemented, some circles of Left Eurasianists and National-Maximalists are still present in our country.\n\nOur intelligence has reported that Mirskiy is in the French Commune, along with the Left SRs and other anti-Eurasianist socialist groups. Shikhmatov is somewhere in Mongolia or China and is said to be doing some field research and refraining from politics. We don't know if we can trust this or not, but what we know is that we are the Only true Eurasianists and any nonconformity should be persecuted.\n\nSavitskiy has suggested that we should fund secret operations to locate Mirskiy and Shikhmatov and get rid of them silently.

However, the National-Maximalist party will not renounce Slavophilia, but contrariwise - accumulate it to the National-Maximalist Doctine of the Eurasian State.

More or less these ideas are matching with the National-Maximalist Doctrine, with the New Oprichnina being basically the 'Land Socialization' SR policy expanded. This creates a perfect synthesis of National-Maximalist and NRPR political doctrines.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one thing that Savinkov is aspiring greatly. The power. The Coalition between National-Maximalists and NRPR put him in a precious position of Shikhmatov's personal advisor, which damages the National-Maximalist image. By legitimizing Savinkov's role in the government, for instance, making him a Prime-Minister will ease this burden and gain more sympathies to Shikhmatov's rule. However, this can put up a job on Shikhmatov, making him even more dependent on the Prime-Minister, who is in the control of the government."

The life of a common man was just as it should be: living in a superpower, that is slowly improving the living standards and industrializing. Of course, there were mass arrests and persecution of nonconformity. In several regions the New Oprichnina has already been implemented with closed cities, mass military production and harsh quotas. But on the bright side, the life in the Eurasian State was just perfect.\n\nDuring one of the such common days in the life of the Eurasian people, it suddenly became evident that something was in the air... On the streets of [ROOT.Capital.GetName] there were soldiers without tokens of the Eurasian State, but with the crown of thorns, crossed by a sword with the Russian tricolor on the service chevron.

He quickly understood that he was used by Savinkov. He was gradually gaining more and more authority over him, the government, and finally, the state. Now even parts of army are on his side, and the consequences are catastrophic to them. It is unlikely that Savinkov will spare him. He will probably be arrested and then executed in the same manner he had previously dealt with Left Eurasianists.\n\n'What are your commands, Yuri Alekseevich?' - Ponomaryov, chief of the State Security Council asked. - 'We cannot just sit right here, waiting to be killed or destroyed by a shell of these traitors out there.'\n\nWas there something he could do? Shikhmatov did not know. He was probably a man, who can lead a superpower, but he had doubts about it throughout his entire political career. He has risen to power due to Savinkov's help and his victory was secured by the Combat Squads and nation-wide fear of the Second Civil War. He feeled like he was cut off from his country, locked in the administrative building in the middle of a massive country.

In a spontaneous attempt to overthrow the government, Savinkov has consolidated the forces and tried to establish control over the [ROOT.Capital.GetName], which he did, but the entire state beyond the city was under the control of Oprichniks or Civilian Administrations of National-Maximalists.\n\nBy escaping the city, Shikhmatov has saved his life, but the fate of Eurasia was still uncertain, due to high popularity of Savinkov in the society.

Why in the whole world have you betrayed me? I trusted you - and you had everything you wanted - for loyalty!'\n\n'You are mistaken, Yuri. There was neither friendship nor loyalty.

Many decades later people will talk about him, research his biography and make up theories about who he really was.\n\nThe Security Service knows where he is and soon he will be arrested.

Do they really think that they will be not executed for their speeches?'\n\nShikhmatov relaxed for a while. His emotional breakdown that just ended has brought some logical thoughts finally.

Now he finally became one of the most important officials in the Eurasian Union.\n\nThe conference should decide some important principles of the future Socialist Enlightenment programme.\n\nJakobson started his speech with the necessity to create a new Enlightenment doctrine, He insisted on creating a cult of a person who shall become the Ceaser of October and the Brutus of the World Bourgeoisie - a man who will liberate the workers and peasants all around the world. This man should be naturally, Mirskiy - the leader of the Eurasian Union.\n\nMirskiy knew he was not such a man. He was rather humble - but decisive. His main desire was the creation of Eurasian Socialism - a movement that will liberate the most talanted stratas of the Eurasian society. But he never view himself as a 'Vozhd of proletariat and peasantry'. It was strange for him. But he belived that this will work.

Now we just need to promote it among the people - our government is not so popular as it can seem to all of you in this top-ranked cabinet, minister. Don't get me wrongly, but with with all due deference, comrade Jakobson - your Enlightenment programme does not fit well in the Narodnichestvo Ideology.'\n\nHaving ended his emotional speech, Spiridonova watched the shocked faces of Mirskiy and Jakobson. The latter one seemed to feel very insulted with the Valkyrie's speech. Jakobson was the first to say.\n\n'Comrade Spiridonova, don't you dare to say that you don't respect the work the Eurasianists have done? By saying what you have said you expose our party's character to attack. You are ruining the coalition and what Comrade Mirskiy is trying to achieve - peace and cooperation between our parties for the benefit of all. We were on different sides of the trenches during the Civil War. But it does not mean that we should not respect each other in such hard times.

The contradictions between Spiridonova and Jakobson became too obvious to be ignored by both of the parties. There was no choice - Mirskiy had to form a coalition to secure his power. But now there is a choice - whether it is Left SRs or SERP. Both of them are natural allies of the Left Eurasianists. But together they cause chaos and crises.\n\nMirskiy now has to make an important decision - he shall choose the apropriate coalition partner. The only one. The others are likely to be very dissapointed with the decision and may cause some turmoil in the society or in the army.\nOn the one hand, the ideals of Jakobson's SERP are more closer to the Eurasianist ones, since Jakobson was a Eurasianist from the beginning.\nOn the other hand, there are Left SRs, a rather unpopular party after the Civil War.

Some, however, believe that Spiridonova should not be blamed for this as he did everything to discredit the SERP and the Left Eurasianists themselves.\n\nOn the other side there is Roman Jakobson, who feels even more betrayed as his ideology fits nicely into the one of the Left Eurasianism.\n\nWith the police and army seeming to be on our side, Mirskiy is likely to stay in power until further action."

While before they believed that he hanged upon the Intelligentsia with Jakobson and Populace with Spiridonova. Now, without both of them, the Left Eurasianist leadership believed that Mirskiy is dangerous and should be removed.\n\nIn an event what will be called later the Glorious Revolution, the supreme Left Eurasianist leadership managed to force Mirskiy to retire. Instead of Mirskiy, with no surprises to the populace and nomenklatura, but with a moderate surprise for the intelligentsia, the Left Eurasianists chose one of the Left SR leaders, Boris Kamkov, as the Chairman of the Left Eurasianist government.\n\nNow in charge, Kamkov, accompanied by Spiridonova, managed to arrest the SERP leaders, which he always desired to do and proclaimed the new, free course of the Eurasian Union - in deep connection with traditions of the state and the desires of the population."

lefteurasia.23.d:0 "Boris Kamkov came up with the idea that the current image of Mirskiy, as the leader of the Left Eurasianist party is a bit... strange. Despite the fact that he's an offspring from Intelligentsia, son of the Tsarist minister of internal affairs, but also his very behavior can have some counter-revolutionary motives. Though Mirskiy's adherence to the principles of Narodism is undoubtful, his image is not the image of the Vozhd of the Proletariat and Peasants. The leader of the great Eurasian nation should be charismatic... he should be the real Brutus of the World Bourgeoisie...\n\nSo, as Kamkov suggests, a new person should be the nominal leader of the Union - with no real power in his hands, but with an image of a strong leader. While, of course, it is hard to choose from a decent amount of candidates for the role, but Kamkov thinks that the best person who fits is... Spiridonova. Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution, leader of the Left SRs, a person who can unite people in their struggle against capitalism."

He accused Kamkov of an attempt to takeover the Union and seize the power in their hands.\n\nNevertheless, he approves the idea of a strong leader image - and he suggested himself. Being a linguist, not so talented as Spiridonova, and as well leader of the political organisation, his suggestion sounded ridiculous.\n\nThere is no prize for guessing that the discussion went on with mutual accusations and insults. The decision, however, was again to be made by Mirskiy. He had a strong feeling that the coalition is within a whisker of being dissolved, but momentary choices were primary this time."

He was unsure if he was the strong leader himself - he tended to accept the ideas of the others and listen to respectful advisors. But now, most of the power is not in his hands, but in the hands of the government, composed of people of different views. His decisions can be easily blocked by the government, even though he is the leader of it.\n\nHowever, he still has a right to expand his powers - so that the government could do nothing. But he will need support - either of Spiridonova or Jakobson. Backed up by one of the coalition partners, he can easily pass the Act and fear no resistance from the Congress.\n\nIt is time to act."

We are destined to live in a historical time of changing epochs. The old world of the new history (which still calls itself "new" out of old habit, has grown old and decrepit) is coming to an end and is decaying, and a new world, as yet unknown, is being born.\n\nAnd it is remarkable that this end of the old world and the birth of a new one is seen by some as a "revolution", while by others it is seen as a "reaction". "Revolutionary" and "reactionary" are now so confused that all distinctness in the use of these terms has been lost. I conventionally designate our epoch as the end of a new history and the beginning of the new Middle Ages. I do not predict which way history will necessarily go, but I only want to draw problematically the ideal features and trends of a new type of society and culture.\n\nThe rational day of modern history is ending, its sun is setting, twilight is falling, we are approaching night.

At the very beginning of the 20th century, Bogdanov spoke with Lenin about the importance of proletarian culture, its main function-the promotion of collectivism and solidarity, necessary for a young socialist state. During the Civil War, in the few parts where the Bolshevik power was strong, Bogdanov was already engaged in Proletkult. But with the fall of the Bolshevik power, like others devoted to Lenin's ideas, Bogdanov left for the Commune.\n\nNow, once again at the head of the Proletkult, Bogdanov was already trying to integrate Eurasian ideas into the worldview of the proletariat. Fortunately, this was not difficult due to the internationality of the ideology of Bolshevism.

And this is not a purely foreign policy issue, it is an internal issue, since these territories, captured by the counter-revolution, are certainly an integral part of the Eurasian Union.

However, the whole question that puzzled the assembly was whether the new state system should be called Eurasian Bolshevism or Bolshevist Eurasianism. Of course, none of them insisted on any one option. Moreover, this question probably concerned only Zinoviev. Of course, none of the names had any specific meaning.

The history made it so he created the largest party in the country, but did he really knew what to do with all that power? It was not him who should answer this. Many decades later people will talk about him, research his biography and make up theories about who he really was.\n\nThe Security Service knows where he is and soon he will be arrested. That was all that mattered. And he would never give up. There is nowhere to escape, so Savinkov unlimbered his gun for action.

POLITICS_DMITRI_MIRSKY_DESC:0 "Dmitri Petrovich Svyatopolk-Mirskiy. The Red Prince. Born in the family of an Imperial Russian Minister of Interior, Dmitri Mirsky was a typical offspring of Intelligentsia - he was brilliantly educated, interested in poetry and languages. He fought in Denikin's army in the Russian Civil War and since 1922 he became interested in Eurasianism and became one of the founding members of the Eurasianist Party. Mirskiy became very intrigued by the victory of the syndicalists in France and was especially intersted in new forms of art developed in the socialist countries. His further support of the syndicalist regimes in the West only strengthened with inability of Kerensky's regime to improve the living standarts and cope with the economic depression in his Motherland. Moreover, he was as well disenchanted in Eurasianists, whom he saw as protectors of the ruling class of aristocracy. By 1936 Mirskiy founds himself as a strong Marxist, though still a prominent Eurasianist, ready to implement a great lean to the left if he will have a chance."
POLITICS_LEV_GUMILYOV_DESC:0 "Lev Gumilyov. Born in a family of famous poets, Nikolay Gumilyov and Anna Akhmatova, Lev was brought up in the manner of a typical Russian Intelligentsia - intersted in Liberal Arts, Languages and History of his Motherland. He early began interested in politics, and his especial interest was in Eurasianism - what he though to be a scientific approach to the roots of the Russian people. During the early 1930s Gumilyov has taken about 3 geological and ethographic expeditions to Central Asia and Mongolia. By 1934 he also became enlisted in the Eurasianist Party, becoming the leader of the youth movement of the party - Union of Eurasian Youth or National-Maximalists. Gumilyov proved himself to be an ambitious and passionate leader with a reputation of a brilliant historian and Eurasianist pioneer. In 1936 Yuri Shikhmatov is a member of the so-called 'Council of Five' - a council of top-ranking Eurasianist leaders, among whom there are Nikolai Trubetzkoy, Pyetr Savitskiy, Georgiy Vernadskiy and Dmitriy Mirskiy. With great ambitions stored in his mind, Gumilyov has a plan to expand his powers as a leader of the youth movement - even if the price is high."

eurasiafor.50.t:0 "The Great Eurasian Union"
eurasiafor.50.d:0 "The government of Eurasia has approached us with a friednly offer - join two our factions into one and unite the majority of Eurasia under a single banner of Genghis Khan. While at first this can seem a madness to many, the Eurasianists approved our great leader to become the Suzerain of Mongolia under the protectorate of mighty Eurasian Army. If we disagree, the relations between our country will worsen a lot, even finally leading to war."

eurasiafor.53.t:0 "Fate of the Mad Baron"
eurasiafor.53.d:0 "Of course, along with Mongolia's integration directly into Eurasia, the question arose of whose control these territories would remain under. On the one hand, if we arrest Baron Ungern, we will violate the agreements under which his fiefdom exists. In this regard, we can leave everything as it is, and let the Baron do what he wants in these territories. On the other hand, a mad Baron can be dangerous. Under his control is an army of thousands of selected Mongolian soldiers, ready to kill for their leader if something goes wrong. Therefore, you can quietly remove the Baron and appoint someone of your own to command the Mongolian Autonomous Region."
eurasiafor.53.a:0 "Let the madman rule in his fiefdom."
eurasiafor.53.b:0 "Make the Baron silently dissappear."

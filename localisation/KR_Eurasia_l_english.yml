eurasia.1.t:0 "Birth of the Eurasian Union"
eurasia.1.d:0 "The regular Duma session has come to an end. The deputies were returning home to their families. Today was a really long day, full of work and routine.\n\nBut in the Tauride Palace there was a light in the single window. There were 5 men in suits in the room, seeting at the long table made of oak: Georgy Vernadskiy and Pyotr Savitskiy were sitting next to each other and conversing in whisper. Opposite to them there was sitting Prince Mirskiy, looking thoughtfully at some papers on the table. Next to him there was the youngest of all, Lev Gumilyov, who was sitting silently. At the head of the table there was Prince Trubetzkoy - the leader of the Eurasianist Party, the prime-minister.\n\nFinally, the latter said: 'It's time to start our meeting...'"
eurasia.1.a:0 "A silent night in Petrograd."

eurasia.2.t:0 "An Opportunity?"
eurasia.2.d:0 "A young Eurasianist, Lev Gumilyov, has suddenly abrupted Prince Trubetzkoy.\n'We should not miss the chance. The future lies in our hands.' - he stated.\n'Calm down, Lev' - Prince Trubetzkoy said nervously. A boy in his mid twenties, who sat in front of him, was a burden for the majority of those present.\nHe was almost twice as young as the other members of the meeting. The leader of the Union of Eurasian Youth, or Young Eurasians, a passionate follower of the Eurasianist doctrine, Lev Gumilyov, born in a family of famous poets, was a talented orator, a smart scholar and a fine exemplar of the younger generation of intelligentsia.\n\n'Perhaps, Lev is right.' - Prince Mirskiy interupted the silence, - 'With our principles implemented in life, with the Duma and the Senate fully supporting us, we are avoir les mains libres.'\n\n'Don't you undestand, Dmitry!' - Trubetzkoy exclaimed. - 'You are speaking of dangerous things. You are speaking of a coup d'etat. The public won't understand. The socialists won't understand. Moreover, the socialists won't accept it.'\n\n'Who cares, Nikolai Sergeevich? Do you really think the army won't support us? All these monarchists, conservators - they will support everything we do, if it is against the socialists'."
eurasia.2.a:0 "There is something in the wind..."

eurasia.3.t:0 "The Turning-Point"
eurasia.3.d:0 "'Enough!' - Gumilyov swept out of the room, leaving the others in silence.\n'He's too young, Nikolai.' - Vernadskiy said the very first word at the meeting. - 'Don't be mad. He's charismatic and emotional. That is why he leads this youth organisation. We should not pay much attention to his words.'\n\n'I'm leaving too' - Mirskiy muttered.\nThree friends, three founders of the Eurasianist ideology were left alone."
eurasia.3.a:0 "Let's go home."

eurasia.4.t:0 "The Black Horse"
eurasia.4.d:0 "'I'm listening.'\nBoris Savinkov was sitting cross-legged in his chair. It was hard to say whether he was showing a real interest in Gumilyov's plea or just was pretending.\n'Boris Viktorovich, I am here to ask for you support. The support of the paramilitaries, perhaps, some finances as well.\n'So why should I be interested?' - Savinkov replied calmly.\n'We are fighting for the future of our Motherland, Boris Viktorovich. We need this victory. With the support of NRPR, I can expect that the Council will listen. They should listen.'\n\n'Stop it, Lev. We both know that is not true. You are driven by a desire to have power. Huge amount of power. Don't you think I am not right?'\n\nGumilyov stood silently for a minute. He believed passionately in his own ideals, his desire to create a fair state of Eurasia was much more than his desire to own any power. A minute passed. Gumilyov looked at the Vozhd; his face was without any emotions, with tightened lips and pursy eyes.\n'So, can I reckon on your support?'\n\nSavinkov answered with a frosty look..."
eurasia.4.a:0 "'You'll receive what you want'"
eurasia.4.b:0 "'I'll talk to Baydalakov about your request'"
eurasia.4.c:0 "'I cannot promise anything.'"

eurasia.5.t:0 "A Council Of Three"
eurasia.5.d:0 "It was a quiet, yet pluvious morning in Petrograd. Savitskiy, Trubetzkoy and Vernadskiy were sitting at the terrace, drinking coffee and recalling the previous night.\n\n'Do you think Gumilyov will act?' - Trubetzkoy asked.\n\n'My friend, you are too worried about a boy who even can't handle his own emotions.' - Savitskiy replied. - 'He is nobody. An offspring of poets, a contentious boy. He has no support and we are the only who he can rely on. Without us he will quickly lose the position of Young Eurasia head.'\n\n'Perhaps you are right. But I cannot stop thinking about his words. Great Eurasia. Coup. Revolution. What was our political struggle for? We supposed to be intellectuals, the new philosopher, founders of the new political thought, not radicals or extremists.'\n\n'Neither we are, Nikolai. Ignore him..."
eurasia.5.a:0 "Maybe it's better to discuss Mirskiy?'"

eurasia.6.t:0 "The Red Prince"
eurasia.6.d:0 "'Mirskiy is said to have some socialist sentiments recently.' - Savitskiy claimed.\n\n'It can be just rumours, Pyetr. We know him for a long time - he's not like this.'\n\n'I understand your skepticism, Nikolai. But his friendship with Sergei Efron and Lev Karsavin...'\n\n'Alright, Pyetr.'\n\nTrubetzkoy was looking meditatively at the panorama of Neva River. He also had some concerns about Mirskiy. Recently he's been too tight lipped and melancholic. Perhaps the rumors are right, but that means that some action should be done. Trubetzkoy continued:"
eurasia.6.b:0 "'We should spy upon him'"
eurasia.6.c:0 "'We should leave him alone'"

eurasia.7.t:0 "Dear, Friend"
eurasia.7.d:0 "I am writing to you in what you know a greatly unstable times. There are some movements in the party. Gumilyov thinks about a coup and installing an autocratic rule of the party. The triumvirate keep their eyes and ears open. It will be hard for us to do anything, only if there is a chance. Your national-maximalists... they are not enough I suppose. We have no equipment to defend ourselves. I am going to contact someone in France.\n\nLook out, they can spy upon us. The face-to-face meetings are now too dangerous. That's why I am writing to you. I am waiting for your reply."
eurasia.7.a:0 "Sincerely, D.P. The Red Prince." 

eurasia.8.t:0 "Tovarisch Chernov"
eurasia.8.d:0 "'I am glad to hear this from you, Dmitri.' - Chernov smiled. The leader of the PSR party seemed to feel quite joyful when Mirskiy asked for his support. With the PSR being a leading political ideologue of Narodism, the ideas of Mirskiy applied to the views of Chernov quite accurately. The very idea of a truly Narodist Russia has been seen as a remedy in the eyes of an old party leader. The peasantry that will finally take the place in the society it deserves. Chernov added:"
eurasia.8.a:0 "'But what about Bukharin?'"

eurasia.9.t:0 "Ice Cracked"
eurasia.9.d:0 "All of the quintuple were sitting in silence. The split became too evident for them, but perhaps nobody realised the real scale of tragedy. At least, Trubetzkoy could do nothing with the split. The founders of a new ideology, of a new world order had nothing to do, but accept the current state of affairs.\n\nThere will be struggle. Eternal struggle for power. The younger generation will try to subdue the elder. The eternal problem of the generation gap. The others fell under the uncontrolable influence of the socialism. If they even understand what the Orthodox Eurasianism gave them, if they don't underestimate the ideocracy we have created. Perhaps, it was all vain."
eurasia.9.a:0 "We should openly announce the party split."
eurasia.9.b:0 "We'd better not show our vulnerability."

eurasia.10.t:0 "The Party Splits"
eurasia.10.d:0 "'The Eurasianist Party has finally put a halt to the rumors about the split in the party.' - was the heading of a fresh newspaper Trubetzkoy was holding in his hands. Perhaps, the open announcement of the split in the party at the Duma session has brought even more concern and problems. Now the authority of the party is shaken. This can be harmful for the future elections as well. But, on the other hand, as Trubetzkoy reflected, the split opens new opportunities - a new political struggle for the Orthodox Eurasianists that should show to the country that they are still strong and ready to fight."
eurasia.10.a:0 "We need a plan."

eurasia.11.t:0 "The Eurasianist Party Congress Announced"
eurasia.11.d:0 "Trubetskoy has announced the extraordinary party congress as what he mediated will be the turning point in the future of the Eurasianist party. At the congress, the delegates from the PLE, led by Mirskiy; Young Eurasianists, led by Gumilyov; and himself, accompanied by Savitskiy and Vernadskiy will present the new party programme for the rest of the Eurasianist party members. After that, the democratic decision will be made: a new party leadership appointed and a new party programme adopted."
eurasia.11.a:0 "The Democracy will always win."

eurasia.12.t:0 "Silence the Opposition"
eurasia.12.d:0 "Even if the party split was a secret, more and more people are becoming treasurers of this secret. The newspapers write about the split in the ruling party according to 'the information from insiders'.\n\nBut it is time to act now. The opposition to the 'Main Party Line' shall be silenced. Neither Mirskiy nor Gumilyov have the influence we do. We must use any chance to crack down on violations and nip in the bud all attempts to overthrow current party leadership."
eurasia.12.b:0 "Focus on Young Eurasianists."
eurasia.12.a:0 "Focus on Left Eurasianists."

eurasia.13.t:0 "Doctrine of Single Ideology"
eurasia.13.d:0 "One of the leaders of the Eurasianist Party, Pyetr Savitskiy has delivered a speech on the party congress about the unity and single ideological agenda made obligatory for all party delegates.\n\nIn this act of authoritarian tendencies inside the Party, the leadership tries to silence the internal opposition to the main policies of the Eurasianists. With the split in the party into leftists, centrists and rightists, this act was seen as a deliberate necessity. With the attempts to silence the opposition, Savitskiy tries to restore order in the party, what he calls 'Putting an end to the eternal vain discourses about the party programme and suppressing destabilizing elements that causing the split within the party.'"
eurasia.13.a:0 "Let us hope this helps."

eurasia.14.t:0 "Gumilyov and Mirskiy Criticize the Doctrine"
eurasia.14.d:0 "The recent doctrine, adopted at the party congress has caused large discontent among the party delegates, especially ones from the left and the right. While the Doctrine has defenitely undermined attitudes of the 'destabilizing elements', they are becoming ready to act more vigorously.\n\nEven if the left and right opposition are still to weak to declare their withdrawal from the party and the list of their supporters being too small, the critics say that the Doctrine of Single Ideology could have caused even more split than it originally planned to supress."
eurasia.14.a:0 "Better for all of us."

eurasia.15.t:0 "Young Eurasianist Union"
eurasia.15.d:0 "The recent week was not easy for Lev. He had to solve major problems, perhaps the most compex ones in his whole life. It was a difficult choice that he had to make. His dissent from traditional Eurasianist doctrine and current party policies drive him to take a decision to leave the party, followed by his confederates.\n\nWith Gumilyov's defection from the Eurasianist party and establishement of the Young Eurasianist Union he has finally and forevermore severed his ties with other members of the Eurasianist Party. But the decision was made. It is rather him or them. Power or suppression. Liberty or prison. What shall he do next? He had a plan. If the debate cannot be solved by peace and words, it will be solved by war and arms."
eurasia.15.a:0 "The power struggle begins."

eurasia.16.t:0 "Party of Left Eurasianists"
eurasia.16.d:0 "Mirskiy was on firm ground. He was standing before his supporters. The First Congress of the PLE, Party of the Left Eurasianists has just ended. A political programme, lineup of the Central Committee was decided on. After the Gumilyov's withdrawal and establishment of the Young Eurasianist Party he has nothing to do, but proclaim his own political power. The new party was supported by some of the socialist parties, and it is said that even the Bolsheviks have installed close ties with the new party."
eurasia.16.a:0 "Socialist Eurasianists?"

eurasia.17.t:0 "Leftist Propaganda"
eurasia.17.d:0 "With the establishement of the Party of Left Eurasianists, the ideology of socialism and Eurasian-wide narodism has spread throughout the country, and, what is most important, amongst the delegates of the Eurasianist party. The socialist ideals are becoming more and more appeal with the propaganda in the mass media. Without any chance to silence the opposition, we must, therefore, increase our efforts to promote Orthodox Eurasianism."
eurasia.17.a:0 "The truth is in Orthodox Eurasianism."

eurasia.18.t:0 "The Rightists Unite"
eurasia.18.d:0 "Perhaps, the charisma of the young leader of the rightist Eurasianists has been decisive in promoting the party's ideology. Moreover, with the support of the NRPR, the Young Eurasianist influence is spreading quicker. We must do something to persuade the delegates of the Congress to stay away from radicalism and support us."
eurasia.18.a:0 "Gumilyov is becoming more pretentious."

eurasia.19.t:0 "The Eurasianist Party Congress Begins..."
eurasia.19.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, it is time to start our session. Most of you understand why this Congress is necessary. There is a serious split in the party, what is more, the split cannot be resolved by building a strong coalition, invulnerable to external enemies and internal ideological disagreements...'\n\nTrubetzkoy stopped. He did not stumbled over words. Either he did not knew what to say next. This momentary pause revealed the real emotions of the party leader - his face expressed sorrow. This Congress, which will become history in the future is about to put an end to the Eurasianist party he knew. The party, which arose from an idea that Russia can be strong - that it should be strong. The unique cultural and political environment, unequalled heroism of the Russian people and reborn Slavophilia in contrast to the Kaiser-appeasing previous government."
eurasia.19.a:0 "Are you alright, Mr. Trubetzkoy?"

eurasia.20.t:0 "The Interlude"
eurasia.20.d:0 "'We have gathered togerther today to elect the new leadership of the party.' - Trubetzkoy continued.\n\n'Being totally faithful in the ideals of the Eurasianist democracy, the only solution to the crisis in the party that I see is through election. At the current session we are going to listen to the delegates from the party fractions.\n\nI will present the speakers. Prince Dmitri Petrovich Mirskiy will speak on behalf of the Left Eurasian fraction. Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov will present the political programme, suggested by the Young Eurasian Movement. On behalf of the current leadership Mr. Savitskiy will speak.\n\nThank you for your attention."
eurasia.20.a:0 "Let's move on."

eurasia.21.t:0 "The Red Prince"
eurasia.21.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, with gratitude to Mr. Trubetzkoy, I may proceed with the agenda of the meeting. I respect the decision of the party leadership to give me the floor to speak. On behalf of the Russian people, peasants and workers of the Eurasian Union, I will present the new party programme, developed by the leading experts in the economic and political spheres. Based on the theoretical assumptions of myself, the Union shall endorse its strength in the majority of its population. By completely destroying the foundations of our society - the Russian people we risk to fall again under the influence of the West. Enslaved by the Kaiser, soured by misfortunes of the tainted Western Capitalism, our nation has lacked unity and strength in achieving its goals. By giving the power to the peasants and workers, the Union will endure forever.\n\nThe new Age is coming. The Prussian Eagle is dying before the swords and torches of the international proletariat. I dare to assure you, the esteemed members of the Congress, that the future is in our hands. In hands of a strong Eurasia, driven by the ideas of narodism and socialism..."
eurasia.21.a:0 "He seems to flatter his knowledge."

eurasia.22.t:0 "The Young Autocrat"
eurasia.22.d:0 "The final of Mirskiy's speech was accompanied by uncovered enmity and general discontent of the Congress members, especially the Young Eurasianists. He was supported by a group of his confederates, who applauded. The presentation of the so-called Red Prince was over.\n\nLev Gumilyov, standing before the Congress has begun his speech.\n\n'Esteemed members of the Congress, I am glad that the Young Eurasianists were given the floor to speak after this disreputable act, performed by the leftist delegation of Left Eurasianists. The Young Eurasianists protest vigorously against the suggestions of Mr. Mirskiy to turn our great Union to a bulwark of international socialism. What I want to highlight is the determination, with which Mirskiy has stated his mock-scientific image of Russian people, and what is most important - Eurasian nation.\n\nThe Young Eurasianists are greatly disillusioned by the decision of Mr. Trubetzkoy to even give the opportunity of this absolutely anti-Eurasianist internationalist group of opposition to perform at the Congress...'\n\nGumilyov continued his ardent speech about the everlasting dishonour of the Left Eurasianistm and flabbiness of the current Eurasianist leadership or whatever. Trubetzkoy was not listening. He was lost in reflection about the decision he had made. Was it right to give the floor to all these ignoramuses? He felt the responsibility before the Congress for what he had just did. Perhaps, it should have been better to silence the opposition and promote unity of the party? Who knows?\n\n'Mr. Savitskiy, before you speak..."
eurasia.22.a:0 "Convince the Congressmen that they are mistaken...'"

eurasia.23.t:0 "The Founding Father"
eurasia.23.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, I would like to begin my speech with telling you the following. A decade ago, when me, Mr. Trubetzkoy, Mr. Suvchinskiy and Mr. Jakobson became the founding fathers of a new revolutionary doctrine - a single idea that the Russian nation can be strong - can be powerful, can be sovereign. From this single idea a new movement was born. A movement that finally won. And I dare to disagree with Mr. Gumilyov. We are all greatly disillusioned that the Congress has to waste time on discussing the ideas that contradict the basis of the Eurasianist ideology. Neither the Left Eurasianists nor the Young Eurasianists are Eurasianists in any sense of this word. Our movement is anti-nationalist and anti-internationalist. We are here to create the new national identity. We are here to create the new ideocracy. But we are here not to create something new - we are here to tell the truth about us, about our origins and about our future. The creation of the Eurasian Union was envisioned by us long before we first appeared in Duma. It is a natural process and we are here to ensure that this process will be stable and will pass without let or hindrance. We all have listened to the performances of Mirskiy and Lev Gumilyov. Their ideas are quite clear and can find reflection in preferences of the Congress members and Russian citizens. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with Eurasianism. And I appeal to everyone, do not make a false step by making nonsense of the Eurasianism. Keep it in mind when you will vote for the new leadership."
eurasia.23.a:0 "A passionate speech!"

eurasia.24.t:0 "The Voting Begins"
eurasia.24.d:0 "'Esteemed members of the Congress, I am glad that we have listened to all the delegates and all the opinions presented today. Now I announce the beginning of the voting. Thank you.'\n\nTrubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy have gone into executive session, leaving the Congress in a state of stormy discussion. The decision was about to be made."
eurasia.24.a:0 "The beginning of a new Era."

eurasia.25.t:0 "New Party Leadership Elected"
eurasia.25.d.orth:0 "While the Congress was voting for the new party leadership, Trubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy were discussing the other, the last but not least topic: what to do next? All three of them while being confident that the majority of the Congress members are still... sane, were mediating about the future if a catastrophe is present. What if the Congress members will listen to Mirskiy, or believe in young Gumilyov?\n\nAn hour passed and the Eurasianist leaders still had no idea. They could just leave the country to escape from possible persecution. They could stay and take charge of resistance to the radicals.\n\nBut suddenly their thoughts were interrupted. It was Roman Jakobson, a close friend of Trubetskoy and Savitskiy.\n\n'The voting has ended.'\n\nWith Trubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy returning into the hall, the results were announced. The Congress votes for..."

An obvious expulsion from the party, hiding underground or moving to the Commune or perhaps, arrest and trial for treason. He tried to convince himself in otherwise. He had a lot of supporters amongst the socialist groups in Russia. The Congress does not completely comprise anti-socialists. He turned to his comrade, Sergey Efron to express his anxiety when suddenly Trubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy returned into the hall. The results were to be announced. The Congress votes for..."
eurasia.25.d.young:0 "Lev Gumilyov, accompanied by fellow Young Eurasianists was always confident in his actions. He knew that the truth was behind his back. Moreover, he was supported by many Congress members and even more influential figures, like Savinkov. He was waiting with patience for the results. The time waxed on, while the votes were still counted. He was not thinking about the consequences if he loses. The Young Eurasianist movement dissolved? Himself arrested? He did nothing wrong. Suddenly, Trubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy returned. The results were to be announced. The Congress votes for..."

eurasia.29.t:0 "Increased Paramilitary Activity"
eurasia.29.d:0 "We have recieved information from the security services that there was a significant rise in paramilitary activities recently. All of extremists belong either to the Left Eurasianists or Young Eurasianists. They steal the weapons from the army storehouses or get them through the black market, which can be explained by an unprecedented act of official venality. Moreover, those who have initiated this illegal actions share responsibility similar in nature to frank-pledge, so the investigation can possibly show nothing and the guilty ones will remain out of prison."
eurasia.29.a:0 "Initiate the investigation."

eurasia.30.d:0 "It all started as always. The Putilov plant. Furious workers with irrational demands. A large strike that targeted the main industrial factory in the country in order to press for governmental action.\n\nTrubetzkoy has been sitting in the Tauride Palace. An emergency council was convened in order to solve the current situation. He was accompanied by the supreme party leadership, consisting of Savitskiy, Vernadskiy, Chkheidze and Jakobson. The council has also invited the supreme Commander-in-Chief, Lavr Kornilov if the army support to disperse the strike will become essential.\n\n'Esteemed members of the Council, we are here to discuss the Putilov plant strike that is currently damaging the stability of the Union and is leading to further radicalization of the society. As reported, the strike is organized by the Left Eurasianist Party with the support of the socialist parties, including PLSR, NSP, RSDRP and PSR. The chance to succeed is debatable, but possibly high if we just disperse the workers, perhaps with the support of the army officers and the police. On the other hand, in case of our failure, the strike can spread to the other plants and cities, leading to an economic collapse, the consequences of which can be severe for our stability. Any ideas or suggestions, my most esteemed colleagues?'\n\nThe majority of the council has agreed with Trubetzkoy, except for Savitskiy, who was also supported by Kornilov. He insisted on a more radical way of suppressing the socialist opposition, arresting the leaders and imposing a state of emergency until the socialist resistance will be completely eradicated."

Whether the sides were equal in strength, the Left Eurasianists, accompanied by the striking workers have outweighed the nationalists. The arrived police and army could do nothing as their strength was not enough.\n\nSoon after the Young Eurasianists were defeated, some of them dead or escaped, the radicals tried to seize the Tauride Palace, where the emergency council was held. Almost at the same time Gumilyov was arrested under a mandate of the council, which led to the final defeat of the Young Eurasianist movement today.\n\nThe Tauride Palace was soon seized by the protesters, that were led by Prince Mirsky, Shirinsky-Shikhmatov and paramilitaries led by Sergei Efron. The council was soon arrested and detained. Red Prince has declared the transition of power to the workers and peasants of the Left Eurasianist party with the new government formed."

Lev Gumilyov has also escaped the justice with nobody revealing his current position. It seems that with these events though the rule of the Eurasianist Party was secured, it as well made the regime more authocratic.

Moreover, Kornilov has also contributed in their victory, showing a decisive support of the nationalists.\n\nSoon after the Left Eurasianists were defeated, the Young Eurasianists, led by Lev Gumilyov tried to seize the Tauride Palace, where the emergency council was held. They could have lost this fight, if Kornilov wasn't on their side. To a great surprise of the Eurasianist leadership, he personally arrested the emergency council.

Not only will this our capital city safer by moving it away from the borders, especially with an unfriendly West. Three cities were chosen as the possible capitals: Nizhny Novgorod, Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk. The first city is located on a high fortified hill with a strategic location on the banks of the Oka and Volga rivers. The second city is the capital of the Ural Region, a large industrialized city. The third choice is to move away the capital as far as the Eastern Siberia - to the city of Novosibirsk, a mostly rural area, close to the borders of Mongolia and Transamur."

Their return has come across a greater discontent among the White Generals, that issued to the government that the Red Generals should be immediately arrested.\n\nHowever, under the new government it is impossible.

### Orthodox Eurasianist Events ###
ortheurasia.1.t:0 "The New Age"
ortheurasia.1.d:0 "Trubetzkoy entered the hall, quickly glancing around the crowded room and plumped down on the only available chair. In fact, it was not a random chair - it was the chair of the leader of the Eurasianist party.\n\nThe Dust has settled. The leaders of the opposition on the inner circles have been either arrested or escaped the country. The rule of the Eurasianists was secured and now the actual reforms and transformation of the Russian Society can be achieved. Trubetzkoy greeted the supporters. The whole admiring concourse gazed on him. Trubetzkoy, though being a significant politician, who was now in charge of the whole country has never adored his popularity. He was rather a modest person, who believed that he was a scientist in the first place.\n\nHe now had some time to look over the crowd. It was the Intelligentsia at its best: the former and the incumbent Senators, professional and famous scientists, including Vladimir Zvorykin, a pioneer of the television, Igor and Boris Kurchatovs, leading nuclear researchers. There were also various musicians, artists and composers, including Igor Stravinsky, member of the Eurasianist Party, who had just returned from Germany, and Dmitri Shostakovich, the rising composer. Rurik Ivnev and Anatoliy Mariengof amused the crowd, reciting verses. The banquet was about to start.\n\nCloser to Trubetzkoy his closest associates were sitting: Pyetr Savitskiy and Georgiy Vernadskiy with his father. A little further Konstantin Chkheidze was standing, accompanied by Felix Yusupov, Dmitri Romanov and Vasily Shulgin. Finally, Trubetzkoy's eye lighted on a familiar faces of Roman Jakobson and Pyetr Suvchinskiy, who were tackling a subject."
ortheurasia.1.a:0 "The public function has begun."

ortheurasia.2.t:0 "Further Plans"
ortheurasia.2.d:0 "When the loud noises of the just finished party has finally stopped, there were 5 of them in the room left. Trubetzkoy's mind has drifted towards the recent papst. Was it a sudden inspiration or memory? He remembered when one silent night in Petrograd there were also 5 of them together, discussing some more important stuff than a new symphony of Shostakovich. He tried to dismiss this obsessive thought. At least, he composed himself, the two radicals have vanished from the politics and now I am surrounded by like-minded men.\n\nIt was not so in the reality. The new Council of Five, which now included Jakobson and Chkheidze was a far more diverse club than Trubetzkoy could imagine. But this time they had to cooperate somehow - yield ground and talk. A new insurgency is stictly prohibited - and all of them knew it.\n\nAll of them respected Trubetzkoy's authority and unconditional leadership but at the same time they knew Trubetzkoy's failings and his modest character. Every one of them wanted their piece of pie, and if they wanted their intiatives to be promoted, they had to sacrifice something - perhaps, the overall party stability."
ortheurasia.2.a:0 "Cooperation is a key!"

ortheurasia.3.t:0 "Position of Intelligentsia"
ortheurasia.3.d:0 "'If in the beginning of the century the 90% of the country populations were peasants, illiterate and poor, the February Revolution of 1917 has brought the rights and power to the poorest classes. The Bolshevist and SR propaganda, that perverted the minds of common people with fairy tales of Marx and Engels, has destroyed the legitimacy of socialism in the world, that led to the final failure of the Bolshevist plot.\n\nOur party of Eurasianists has brought the new ideology into life - the ideology of free people, willing to become as educated as scientists, as rich as aristocrats and to become proud bearers of the new nation.\n\nLet us throw off the shackles of the past. Let us listen to the intellectuals - to those, who know represent all the best our nations has. Let the politicians lead you to the brightness of the future. Let the new social class evolve - every Russian should belong to intelligentsia: recite modern Russian poetry, listen to the flourishing Russian Classical music, bear in mind the covenants of the past, learn the history of our nation as it is - from the genesis of Russian statehood on the foundation of Mongol Overlordship..."
ortheurasia.3.a:0 "...Let us prosper forever!'"

ortheurasia.4.t:0 "Who We Are?"
ortheurasia.4.d:0 "Up to quite a recent time the majority of Russian citizens never knew what Eurasianism is. The political programme of Eurasianists, that promised anti-German and anti-syndicalist foreign policy, prosperity to all the social classes, the increased role of the Orthodox Church have not brought any clarity to the minds of common citizens. They just knew that Eurasianists offered something new and something that will make the state of Russia protected and strong.\n\nNeither had they time nor ability to read long and abstruse articles and books of Trubetzkoy, Savitskiy and Vernadskiy. While seeming too esoteric and mock-scientific for the ones, the ideas of Eurasianists at the same time seemed reasonable and gifted them with an almost tangible sense of unity with the history. While the Eurasianist programme of Enlightenment is already full-scale, many of the citizens and children at school being taught the origins of Eurasianism, everything is becoming more and more clear. The process of nation-building has begun - the process of 'Eurasianisation' of the whole Russian population - if the Ideocracy works - the greatest experiment we have ever witnessed will tell."
ortheurasia.4.a:0 "A new nation shall evolve."

ortheurasia.5.t:0 "Earth"
ortheurasia.5.d:0 "Every single one of you, Russian citizens, should once ask himself. Who am I? Why do I exist? And I believe that the majority of you will find it hard to answer these questions. They are complex - and they are quite serious.\nBut I will give you the answer - you are an Eurasian person. You live at the joints of two major civilization - The European one and the Asian one. Our great country is the only ever existed country that had an amazing chance to contemplate how these two civilizations run into one.\n\nN.Trubetzkoy, 1928"
ortheurasia.5.a:0 "We are special."

ortheurasia.6.t:0 "Culture"
ortheurasia.6.d:0 "Our cultural singularity cannot be view as European or Asian. Instead, it is Eurasian - a mixture, an alloy. We shall turn to our ancestors - children of Turan, children of Genghis Khan, brave warriors, equestrians and skilled workers. We shall never forget our origins and our roots. And we shall always remember who we are - the Eurasians.\nP.Savitskiy, 1926."
ortheurasia.6.a:0 "The sun rises in the East."

ortheurasia.7.t:0 "Idea"
ortheurasia.7.d:0 "I believe you understood my lessons right - the Principles you should always remember and never forget. Remember your origins - and remember who you are. The Idea is what rules the nation, what makes people fight in wars for their survival. The Idea that they can be free. That they can live, love, marry, earn their living. Our nation of Eurasians should be founded on a conscious idea, rather than materialistic ideals. And I want for every Russian, Ukrainian, Buryat, Tatar to remember this idea. We are Eurasians and we shall preserve our unique culture.\nG.Vernadskiy, 1932"
ortheurasia.7.a:0 "In the beginning was the Idea."

ortheurasia.8.t:0 "Space"
ortheurasia.8.d:0 "A unique combination of landscapes where our nation has been born is called Mestorazvitie. The tundra of Kola, the taiga of Olonets, the forests and steppes. An unlimited expanse of sea and the horizonless sky. Our Eurasian State is a living organism and it is natural for it to expand. The Space is the reason we have people speaking Russian in Harbin and Vladivostok, in Bokhara and Baku, in Warsaw and Lemberg. We shall protect our space - and we shall conquer more space.\nP.Savitskiy, 1934"
ortheurasia.8.a:0 "Vast Expanses of the Motherland"

ortheurasia.9.t:0 "Legitimizing Eurasianism"
ortheurasia.9.d:0 "The Eurasianists have publicly announced the establishement of the new state - Eurasia, the establishement basically a new religion of Eurasianism and started the process of the nation-building. But since the very establishement of the Union, the Eurasian citizens still lacked formal identification of their new nationality and citizenship. With the successful internalization of Eurasianism by many Russian citizens, the Party has decided to adopt the new ID System and widely expanding it so that now every single citizen will receive formal personality identification. By issuing new Eurasian passports to every citizen, we can ensure that they can move around the country, protected by the law and the police and be treated as equal. The new Eurasian passport will mention citizenship of '[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]' and the 'Eurasian' nationality for everyone. The ethnic minorities will also have 'Eurasian' nationality in their passports, but with their minor nationality mentioned in brackets."
ortheurasia.9.a:0 "The reform will ensure stability."

ortheurasia.10.t:0 "A Resignation?"
ortheurasia.10.d:0 "Trubetzkoy, as always, was in his thoughts, looking through some papers at the table. He briefly read the report of the government on current issues and sighed heavily. He was tired. He looked at the photograph in a frame, which depicted himself, Vernadskiy and Savitskiy at the beginning of their careers as politicians at the first congress of the Eurasianist Party. It was almost 20 years ago, when he was younger and more ambitious. Now, after many months of being the head of the government, Trubetzkoy was really tired. Moreover, he was not feeling as ambitious as his party associates who were or pretended to be as vigorous as earlier.\n\nTrubetzkoy has lost his unshakable authority over the Eurasianist Party, but he did everything he could to ensure our victory. He has won the elections and has been a highly proficient prime-minister during all this time. It's time to step down and continue to work steadily in the Senate, where almost nothing can bother him."
ortheurasia.10.a:0 "Trubetzkoy Steps Down as Prime-Minister!"

ortheurasia.11.t:0 "A Resignation?"
ortheurasia.11.d:0 "Trubetzkoy, as always, was in his thoughts. Having an unprecendented authority over the Senate and his party, he was thinking of expanding his powers even more. He was thinking of a large reform of the executive branch of the Eurasian Union, where he will be the head of state and should form the government as he wants, instead of the parliament.\nLater this week he has presented his bill to the Duma and the Senate, which was in majority supported without amendements. This marks the beginning of a new Era in the history of the Eurasianist party and the Eurasian Union."
ortheurasia.11.a:0 "Trubetzkoy Becomes President of the Union."

ortheurasia.12.t:0 "Chkheidze Proposal"
ortheurasia.12.d:0 "Chkheidze has delivered a large speech in the Senate, where he theoretically justified that the restoration of Romanov Monarchy is necessary to achieve popular support of our government. He claims that with the Tsar back, our legitimacy can be secured and a long tradition of monarchy will continue.\n\nThe Senate, however, was divided on this issue. The ones stated that we should not move away from the Orthodox Eurasianist doctrine, but the others believed in Chkheidze's theses. With Chkheidze's authority being rather high, his proposal is likely to be passed by the majority of the Senate. However, they can also listen to the opinion of Trubetzkoy and other founding fathers, who are unlikely to support Chkheidze."
ortheurasia.12.a:0 "We should restore the Tsar."
ortheurasia.12.b:0 "The proposal is rejected."

ortheurasia.13.t:0 "An Heir To The Throne"
ortheurasia.13.d:0 "When the first disputes have been finally settled, the other ones arose. Who shall be the Tsar? After the Revolution the successors to the throne have been disputed between the Royal Family members. We can help them to solve this question finally, simply by choosing the preferable heir.\n\nThe first candidate is self-proclaimed Emperor of All-Russia in-exile, Kirill Vladimirovich. The second candidate is Dmitri Pavlovich, former speaker of the Senate, an aristocrat and one of the VNS party leaders. The third candidate, suggested by Chkheidze himself is the young prince Andrei Alexandrovich, the eldest nephew of the last Tsar Nicholas II."
ortheurasia.13.a:0 "Kirill Vladimirovich."

ortheurasia.13.c:0 "Andrei Alexandrovich."

ortheurasia.14.t:0 "Tsar of All Eurasia"
ortheurasia.14.d:0 "By the Grace of God, We, [ROOT.GetLeader], Emperor and Autocrat of All the Eurasia, Moscow, Kiev, Vladimir, Novgorod; Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Tsar of Poland, Tsar of Siberia, Tsar of Chersonese Taurian, Tsar of Georgia; Lord of Pskov and Grand Prince of Smolensk, Lithuania, Volhynia, Podolia, Finland; Prince of Estland, Livland, Courland, Semigalia, Samogitia, Belostok, Karelia, Tver, Yugorsky land, Perm, Vyatka, Bolgar and others; Lord and Grand Prince of Nizhny Novgorod, Chernigov, Ryazan, Polotsk, Rostov, Yaroslavl, Belozersk, Udorsky land, Obdorsk, Kondia, Vitebsk, Mstislav, and all of the northern countries Master; and Lord of Iberia, Kartli, and Kabardia lands and Armenian provinces; hereditary Sovereign and ruler of the Circassian and Mountainous Princes and of others; Lord of Turkestan; Heir of Norway; Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, and Oldenburg, and others, and others, and others."
ortheurasia.14.a:0 "Glory to the Tsar!"

ortheurasia.15.t:0 "The Basis"
ortheurasia.15.d:0 "The disagreements between the Eurasianists were always the stumbling block in the party unity and stability. Firstly, large disagreements between Mirskiy, Trubetzkoy and Gumilyov led to an obvious ideological conflict. Once supporters of the Classic Eurasianism, the two politicians tried to adapt the ideology for their own purposes and needs. Such opposition was suppressed. Many of the Eurasianist pioneers believe that there should be no ideological diversity in the party with staying as close to the initial course as possible. The others, mainly including Jakobson and Chkheidze believe that some sort of leaning from the 'Main Party Line' is possible and can be even beneficial to the state and its citizens."
ortheurasia.15.a:0 "We should respect classic Eurasianism."
ortheurasia.15.b:0 "We should be able to have some freedom in the party ideology."

ortheurasia.16.t:0 "Eurasianism En Masse"
ortheurasia.16.d:0 "The Eurasianist movement has grown to become the wide-spread ideology our country have ever witnessed. It has spread into politics, history, art, science and education and became almost a religion. Our popular support is great, there is almost no opposition due to the Duma and the Senate being completely under our influence. All underground anti-Eurasianist activites are suppressed and people are generally in favour of our rule. However, there are still people who threaten our Motherland from abroad. After they tried to seize the power, Mirskiy and Gumilyov left the country, though still being active. While no real suppression of their supporters have been ever implemented, some circles of Left Eurasianists and Young Eurasianists are still present in our country.\n\nOur intelligence has reported that Mirskiy is in the French Commune, along with the Bolsheviks and other anti-Eurasianist socialist groups. Gumilyov is somewhere in Mongolia or China and is said to be doing some field research and refraining from politics. We don't know if we can trust this or not, but what we know is that we are the Only true Eurasianists and any nonconformity should be persecuted.\n\nSavitskiy has suggested that we should fund secret operations to locate Mirskiy and Gumilyov and get rid of them silently. He was supported by Vernadskiy and some other party members, including Trubetzkoy - though reluctantly. The fate of the operation depends on the decision of [ROOT.GetLeader]."
ortheurasia.16.a:0 "They should be wiped off the history."
ortheurasia.16.b:0 "They are not any dangerous to our regime."

ortheurasia.17.t:0 "The Royal Constitution"
ortheurasia.17.d:0 "Upon the changes in the political system of the Eurasian Union and restoration of the Monarchy, the government has drafted a new Royal constitution, that mentions the Tsar as the head of state. Though he has almost no power and is more of a figurehead, the Constitution will increase the legitimacy of the monarch. According to the new Constitution the powers of the Senate and the government will be greatly increased, while Duma will be transformed into a deliberative body."
ortheurasia.17.a:0 "A new Constitution for the Empire."

ortheurasia.18.t:0 "Bringing back Table of Ranks"
ortheurasia.18.d:0 "The Table of Ranks was an official list of positions and ranks in the military, government and court of the Russian Empire, firstly introduced by Peter the Great. The Table of Ranks was abolished by the Bolsheviks soon after their coup in 1917, but later it was never re-established, leaving our countries with everyone 'equal'. With the monarchy restored it is time to re-establish the Table of Ranks, that will formally secure the social hierarchy. However, some Senators are against the re-establishment, claiming that this will only deepen the social tensions in the country."
ortheurasia.18.a:0 "Re-introduce the Table of Ranks."
ortheurasia.18.b:0 "We don't need this remnant of past."

### Young Eurasianists Events ###
youngeurasia.1.t:0 "Cross of Arrows"
youngeurasia.1.d:0 "Gumilyov was sitting at the table - at the place where Trubetzkoy once was sitting and made a poor show. Now Gumilyov was riding the fore-horse. Quickly after his rise to power the all the opposition was persecuted, expect the loyal movements that were now a part of the government. With all the power now in the hands of his party, Gumilyov was planning to implement his first decrees as soon as possible. His rule was quite consolidated, but yet demanded more control over the citizens and subjects of the state.\n\nGumilyov was looking in the window, where the bright sun was shining, what he thought was a providence. At the street, his loyal soldiers were marching. The leading one was holding a black banner with yellow arrows."
youngeurasia.1.a:0 "The Krestostrel will lead the nation."

youngeurasia.2.t:0 "The New Order"
youngeurasia.2.d:0 "It is time to implement our most radical - and, therefore, our most progressive policy in consolidating our power - the formation of the New Oprichnina. Some territories will receive a special status and will be under the direct control of the Young Eurasianist Party. The citizens in this areas will in majority serve the state, special units of our paramilitaries will be reorganized into Neo-oprichniks, local political police force that will ensure that there is no resistance to our rule."
youngeurasia.2.a:0 "Are we returning to the Dark Ages?"

youngeurasia.3.t:0 "Legacy of Ancient Rus"
youngeurasia.3.d:0 "Slavophilia was an intellectual movement in the Imperial Russia, that stated that the Russians had the unique culture and society and that the Western influence was alien and disturbing for the centuries-developed Russian State. The basis of the Slavophilia ideology was the Orthodox Religion and Sobornost - the special term for organic unity, intregration between people.\n\nThe Trubetzkoy's party has for long been renouncing the idea of Slavophilia, claiming that their movement is Revolutionary-Traditionalist and Slavophilia differed radically from the doctrines of Eurasianism. However, the Young Eurasianist party will not renounce Slavophilia, but contrariwise - accumulate it to the Young Eurasianist Doctine of the Eurasian State. It is undoubtedly that our country has its own way and the progressive Young Eurasianist movement will lead.\n\nIn the ideology of Young Eurasianism, Orthodox Christianity, the Russians as the constitutive element of the state, Sobornost and a firm, dictatorial power of the Party combines in one, creating the strongest state the World has ever witnessed."
youngeurasia.3.a:0 "Never forget your origins."

youngeurasia.4.t:0 "Fruits of Loyalty"
youngeurasia.4.d:0 "It was him. A tall slight man, standing in the hall, dressed in a military uniform and surrounded by officers. The crown of thorns, crossed by a sword was almost blazing on his chest. It was Boris Viktorovich Savinkov, surrounded by his paramilitary Combat Squads supreme command. Gumilyov was standing right in front of him. The two men, one being almost twice as older as the second one has shaked their hands and went to the room, leaving the paramilitaries alone.\n\n'Boris Viktorovich, with respect and honour, I am happy to announce that I believe your proposal of creating a united Young Eurasianist-NRPR cabinet is accepted. The harsh reality of life compels us, that in order to survive - and to ensure the survival of the State, our parties should unite the efforts in rebuilding a strong and independent Eurasia. I've listened to the advice of yours and will definetely assign Aleksandr and Emma Dikgof-Derental as foreign and security ministers respectively'.\n\nTwo men have once again shaken their hands and left the room, where Savinkov soon went away, accompanied by his loyal officers.\n\nSavinkov has already left long ago, but Gumilyov was still thinking of the meeting, the third or the fourth one since their first appointment. They did not talked too much, neither did they write letters to each other. But Gumilyov knew that Savinkov's assistance was exceptional for the Young Eurasianists to rise to power."
youngeurasia.4.a:0 "A new story begins..."

youngeurasia.5.t:0 "Implementing the NRPR Programme"
youngeurasia.5.d:0 "The Savinkov's NRPR programme mixes various ideas that had influence him through his life, that includes a totalitarian dictatorial rule, agrarian Socialist-Revolutionary policy, Orthodox Christianity, and a concept of palingenetic rebirth. More or less these ideas are matching with the Young Eurasianist Doctrine, with the New Oprichnina being basically the 'Land Socialization' SR policy expanded. This creates a perfect synthesis of Young Eurasianist and NRPR political doctrines.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one thing that Savinkov is aspiring greatly. The power. The Coalition between Young Eurasianists and NRPR put him in a precious position of Gumilyov's personal advisor, which damages the Young Eurasianist image. By legitimizing Savinkov's role in the government, for instance, making him a Prime-Minister will ease this burden and gain more sympathies to Gumilyov's rule. However, this can put up a job on Gumilyov, making him even more dependent on the Prime-Minister, who is in the control of the government."
youngeurasia.5.a:0 "Make Savinkov the prime-minister."
youngeurasia.5.b:0 "Let's not underestimate Savinkov."

youngeurasia.6.t:0 "A Common Day"
youngeurasia.6.d:0 "It was a common day in the Eurasian State. The playground was filled with noisy children, people made haste to get to their jobs on time, the industrial plants were emitting smoke, providing equipment for the State. Few cars were seen on the streets, including NAZ-1, a serial Eurasian sedan, based on Ford Model 18, which became popular and wide-spread among Eurasian citizens. The life of a common man was just as it should be: living in a superpower, that is slowly improving the living standards and industrializing. Of course, there were mass arrests and persecution of nonconformity. In several regions the New Oprichnina has already been implemented with closed cities, mass military production and harsh quotas. But on the bright side, the life in the Eurasian State was just perfect.\n\nDuring one of the such common days in the life of the Eurasian people, it suddenly became evident that something was in the air... On the streets of [ROOT.Capital.GetName] there were soldiers without tokens of the Eurasian State, but with the crown of thorns, crossed by a sword with the Russian tricolor on the service chevron. The soldiers looked like they were wearing the NRPR symbolics, which was strange. Finally, two or three hours later there were tanks and artillery seen on the main street, heading towards the administrative building, where the Eurasian government was in session."
youngeurasia.6.a:0 "Something's happening."

youngeurasia.7.t:0 "Suspence"
youngeurasia.7.d:0 "Gumilyov was holding a conference in the [ROOT.Capital.GetName] Government building, where he just heard the news from his loyal Secret Service officer, that there are tanks and soldiers in the streets, and that they are heading towards them in a possible endeavor to overthrow the government.\n\nGumilyov was chilled with terror for a minute or more. He quickly understood that he was used by Savinkov. He was gradually gaining more and more authority over him, the government, and finally, the state. Now even parts of army are on his side, and the consequences are catastrophic to them. It is unlikely that Savinkov will spare him. He will probably be arrested and then executed in the same manner he had previously dealt with Left Eurasianists.\n\n'What are your commands, Lev Nikolayevich?' - Ponomaryov, chief of the State Security Council asked. - 'We cannot just sit right here, waiting to be killed or destroyed by a shell of these traitors out there.'\n\nWas there something he could do? Gumilyov did not know. He was probably a man, who can lead a superpower, but he had doubts about it throughout his entire political career. He has risen to power due to Savinkov's help and his victory was secured by the Combat Squads and nation-wide fear of the Second Civil War. He feeled like he was cut off from his country, locked in the administrative building in the middle of a massive country. He was thinking for a minute more and then said in the most calmly voice a startled man can talk."
youngeurasia.7.a:0 "We must evacuate the building and escape the city."

youngeurasia.7.c:0 "Order the Army to shoot the traitors."

youngeurasia.8.t:0 "Salvation"
youngeurasia.8.d:0 "It took about 40 minutes or more for the Council to escape [ROOT.Capital.GetName] until they crossed the city border and found themselves relocated in the closest security post. The officers were amused to see the head of state in their small subdivision, but from there Gumilyov managed to contact the loyal Army generals, that had verified that a group of soldiers and generals have joined the so-called 'Provisional Council of the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom', led by Savinkov himself. In a spontaneous attempt to overthrow the government, Savinkov has consolidated the forces and tried to establish control over the [ROOT.Capital.GetName], which he did, but the entire state beyond the city was under the control of Oprichniks or Civilian Administrations of Young Eurasianists.\n\nBy escaping the city, Gumilyov has saved his life, but the fate of Eurasia was still uncertain, due to high popularity of Savinkov in the society. Therefore, a further action was needed."
youngeurasia.8.a:0 "Surround the city and destroy the enemies."
youngeurasia.8.b:0 "Find Savinkov and execute him."

youngeurasia.9.t:0 "The Last of Eurasianists"
youngeurasia.9.d:0 "Gumilyov, surrounded by his supporters quickly ran downstairs, where a governmental car was waiting for him to evacuate the city. He gave a wrench at the door-handle and exited the building...\n\nIt was Savinkov himself, standind just in front of him, surrounded by a massive number of Combat Squads, all pointing guns in the Gumilyov's side.\n\n'It is over, Lev.' - Savinkov stood still in his uniform, with his soul-chilling glance.\n\nGumilyov was unarmed. In fact, he had never shot in his entire life, never felt a gun in his hand. He was from the generation of young Intelligentsia, poets and artists, whose main life satisfaction was peaceful and vain discussions about the future of their state.\n\n'Boris Viktorovich, I had done nothing. Why in the whole world have you betrayed me? I trusted you - and you had everything you wanted - for loyalty!'\n\n'You are mistaken, boy. There was neither friendship nor loyalty. The world is far more complicated than the fairy tales about World Dominance, while you are sitting in the cabinet and do literally nothing to achieve the power. You are too young, too passionate and too unexperienced. You acted like a fool and you was fooled. That's the rules of the game.'\n\nwGumilyov had nothing to answer. When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, 'Come.' I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him.\n\nThe gunshots followed. Gumilyov was lying on the ground, looking in the sky. It was becoming darker and darker, until it was so dark, that the only thing was illuminating - the Star of Genghis Khan. In the Dark Sky of Eurasia."

But they were outnumbered.\n\nEvery single Oprichnik and loyal solider was lying dead on the ground. The forces of so-called 'Provisional Council of the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom', led by Savinkovites have destroyed the main protection of the government building.

Many decades later people will talk about him, research his biography and make up theories about who he really was.\n\nThe Security Service knows where he is and soon he will be arrested. That was all that mattered. And he would never give up. There is nowhere to escape, so Savinkov unlimbered his gun for action.

Of course, there were mass arrests and persecution of nonconformity. In several regions the New Oprichnina has already been implemented with closed cities, mass military production and harsh quotas. But on the bright side, the life in the Eurasian State was just perfect.\n\nDuring one of the such common days in the life of the Eurasian people, it suddenly became evident that something was in the air... On the streets of [ROOT.Capital.GetName] there were soldiers without tokens of the Eurasian State, but with the crown of thorns, crossed by a sword with the Russian tricolor on the service chevron.

Unlike the Orthodox Eurasianists, Gumilyov believes that the idea that stating the Eurasianist ethnicity from the above won't have any positive influence at all. Instead, the Young Eurasianists, taking this viewpoint from the NRPR policy believe that all ethnicites are unequal and have limited rights compared to the Russians.\n\nThis policy of Russian Supremacy is likely to be undermined by all the minorities and even have negative effect on the stability and popularity of our government.

He was never fond of the idea of coalition with Bolsheviks. The exiled ones, the ones who hever tried to achieve the Revolution they desperately wanted. Lenin was shot, Trotsky disappeared - and the war was already lost. Those who remained were either arrested or executed, except for those who were pardoned by corrupt Kerensky. The Old Guard, including Zinoviev and Kamenev just escaped the country like rats leave the shipwreck. They never tried to do anything during these 15 years - they were just sitting abroad in safety.

But Trubetzkoy never understood that his desire to create a special class that will rule the Eurasian peasantry is just a bunch of aristocrats and nobles who will only rob the common people, just like they did for 500 years already.

And now they are sitting next to each other getting ready to negotiate on some coalition matters, nobody of them wanted to discuss.\n\nThe revolution was successful - the power in the Eurasian Union should belong to Bolsheviks.

We are now at the new stage of the Russian Revolution - the third one. This time the Russian people has evaluated into something greater - into identifying them as Eurasians.

But he had no other choice when he read in the newspaper that the leftists become victorous in the Eurasian Union.

If enmity was a right word in this situation. Zinoviev was not at the public rally nor at the plant before the workers. Why so much affected pathos if there were only 3 of them in the room?

Now he finally became one of the most important officials in the Eurasian Union. Although now, in Eurasia, his ideas of proletarian culture were somewhat... misunderstood.

The conference should decide some important principles of the future Socialist Enlightenment programme.\n\nLunacharskiy started his speech with the necessity to create a Myth of October - transformation of what was known as an October Bolshevist Insurgency into the Great Socialist Revolution that laid the foundations of World Revolution. Moreover, he insisted on creating a cult of Lenin's personality - and more important up-to-date - a person who shall become the Ceaser of October and the Brutus of the World Bourgeoisie - a man who will liberate the workers and peasants all around the world.

Crushed by the National-Maximalist Militia and the Eurasian Army they shall choose death or exile - and the choice is obvious for Zinoviev. He was never a hero, the one that Lenin was. Being a leader, an orator, a manager, but not the hero - he will not die for the idea that will never be embodied. The counter-revolutionary Left Eurasianists will never achieve the true power of socialism. He was given time to live - a great deal of mercy that Zinoviev himself lacked greatly - and he appreciated it. It's time to leave - together with the Old Guard.

Some, however, believe that Zinoviev should not be blamed for this as he did everything to discredit National-Maximalists and the Left Eurasianists themselves.\n\nOn the other side there is Prince Shikhmatov with his National-Maximalists, who feel even more betrayed as their ideology fits nicely into the one of the Left Eurasianism.\n\nWith the police and army seeming to be on our side, Mirskiy is likely to stay in power until further action."

lefteurasia.22.t:0 "Glorious Revolution"
lefteurasia.22.d:0 "It was within a moment when Mirskiy realized what he had done. His refusal to form a new coalition or save the previous one resulted in some kind of insurgency among the Left Eurasianists, who believe that Mirskiy is not a strong leader himself. While before they believed that he hanged upon the Military with Shikhmatov and Populace with Zinoviev. Now, without both of them, the Left Eurasianist leadership believed that Mirskiy is dangerous and should be removed.\n\nIn an event what will be called later the Glorious Revolution, the supreme Left Eurasianist leadership managed to force Mirskiy to retire. Instead of Mirskiy, with no surprises to the military and nomenklatura, but with a moderate surprise for the populace, the Left Eurasianists chose Shikhmatov as the Chairman of the Left Eurasianist government.\n\nNow in charge, Shikhmatov managed to arrest Bolshevik leaders, which he always desired to do and proclaimed the new, free course of the Eurasian Union - in deep connection with traditions of the state and the desires of the population."

lefteurasia.23.t:0 "The Image of the Chairman"
lefteurasia.23.d:0 "Lunacharskiy came up with the idea that the current image of Mirskiy, as the leader of the Left Eurasianist party is a bit... strange in terms of Marxism-Leninism. He's not only an offspring from Intelligentsia, son of the Tsarist minister of internal affairs, but also his very behavior can have some counter-revolutionary motives. Though Mirskiy's adherence to the principles of Marxism is undoubtful, his image is not the image of the Vozhd of the Proletariat and Peasants. The leader of the great Eurasian nation should be charismatic... he should be the real Brutus of the World Bourgeoisie...\n\nSo, as Lunacharskiy suggests, a new person should be the nominal leader of the Union - with no real power in his hands, but with an image of a strong leader. While, of course, it is hard to choose from a decent amount of candidates for the role, but Lunacharskiy thinks that the best person who fits is... Zinoviev. A talented orator, leader of the Bolsheviks, a person who can unite people in their struggle against capitalism."

lefteurasia.24.t:0 "Brutus of the World Bourgeoisie"
lefteurasia.24.d:0 "As expected, the suggestion, raised by the Lunacharskiy has a great deal of condemnation from Shikhmatov, the National-Maximalist leader. He accused Lunacharskiy of an attempt to takeover the Union and seize the power in their hands.\n\nNevertheless, he approves the idea of a strong leader image - and he suggested himself. Being the Rittmeister of the Army, an orator, perhaps not so talented as Zinoviev, and as well leader of the political organisation.\n\nThere is no prize for guessing that the discussion went on with mutual accusations and insults. The decision, however, was again to be made by Mirskiy. He had a strong feeling that the coalition is within a whisker of being dissolved, but momentary choices were primary this time."
lefteurasia.24.a:0 "'Lunacharskiy has the point' - said Mirskiy."

lefteurasia.25.d:0 "Mirskiy was, as always, thinking. This time his thoughts were about the failed coalition and the power. The great nation of the Eurasia should be with a strong leadership, which is not torn apart by either Bolsheviks or National-Maximalists. He was unsure if he was the strong leader himself - he tended to accept the ideas of the others and listen to respectful advisors. But now, most of the power is not in his hands, but in the hands of the government, composed of people of different views. His decisions can be easily blocked by the government, even though he is the leader of it.\n\nHowever, he still has a right to expand his powers - so that the government could do nothing. But he will need support - either of Zinoviev or Shikhmatov. Backed up by one of the coalition partners, he can easily pass the Act and fear no resistance from the Congress.\n\nIt is time to act."

Moreover, we should think of other non-Orthodox Christians and even non-Christians as well. With all these facts lying on the desk of the Rittmeister, he has suggested to create a new Church of Eurasia, according to the National-Maximalist ideology. The Church of Eurasia will unite all parishioner of different faiths under a single Church under a concept of Vseedinstvo (Unity-of-all). This ecumenical organisation will represent every single person in the entire nation.

Rhythmicity and periodicity are characteristic of all life. They speak of organic and critical epochs, of night and day epochs, of sacred and secular epochs. We are destined to live in a historical time of changing epochs. The old world of the new history (which still calls itself "new" out of old habit, has grown old and decrepit) is coming to an end and is decaying, and a new world, as yet unknown, is being born.\n\nAnd it is remarkable that this end of the old world and the birth of a new one is seen by some as a "revolution", while by others it is seen as a "reaction". "Revolutionary" and "reactionary" are now so confused that all distinctness in the use of these terms has been lost. I conventionally designate our epoch as the end of a new history and the beginning of the new Middle Ages. I do not predict which way history will necessarily go, but I only want to draw problematically the ideal features and trends of a new type of society and culture.\n\nThe rational day of modern history is ending, its sun is setting, twilight is falling, we are approaching night. All categories of the already experienced sunny day are unsuitable. By all indications, we have emerged from the day-time historical era and entered the night-time era. This is felt by the most sensitive people.\n\nIs it bad, is it gloomy, is it pessimistic? False veils fall, and good and evil are revealed. The night is no less beautiful than the day, no less divine, in the night the stars shine brightly, in the night there are revelations that the day does not know. The night is primeval, more spontaneous than the day.'\n\nNikolai Berdyaev."

Lunacharsky was inclined to believe that the nation should go through a cultural revolution and be enlightened, but this time with the ideas of Bolshevism and left-Eurasianism.

At the very beginning of the 20th century, Bogdanov spoke with Lenin about the importance of proletarian culture, its main function-the promotion of collectivism and solidarity, necessary for a young socialist state. During the Civil War, in the few parts where the Bolshevik power was strong, Bogdanov was already engaged in Proletkult. But with the fall of the Bolshevik power, like others devoted to Lenin's ideas, Bogdanov left for the Commune.\n\nNow, once again at the head of the Proletkult, Bogdanov was already trying to integrate Eurasian ideas into the worldview of the proletariat. Fortunately, this was not difficult due to the internationality of the ideology of Bolshevism. However, now the most important part of this internationality was the self-perception of Soviet citizens as a new nation of Eurasians - the state-forming class on the entire continent."

And this is not a purely foreign policy issue, it is an internal issue, since these territories, captured by the counter-revolution, are certainly an integral part of the Eurasian Union. The workers and peasants who are fighting for their rights in these primordial Soviet lands must first be enlightened by the ideas of the proletkult, and only then-freed from the eternal slavery of capital.'"

Mirsky and Zinoviev, now not just allies, but also ideologically equal in the eyes of ordinary citizens, had to combine their two ideologies into one. However, the whole question that puzzled the assembly was whether the new state system should be called Eurasian Bolshevism or Bolshevist Eurasianism. Of course, none of them insisted on any one option. Moreover, this question probably concerned only Zinoviev. Of course, none of the names had any specific meaning. They were equivalent and equally personified the policy of the state.\n\nIn the end, the party members agreed that the new state policy would be called Eurasian Bolshevism.

### Leaders loc ###
POLITICS_DMITRI_MIRSKY_DESC:0 "Dmitri Petrovich Svyatopolk-Mirskiy. The Red Prince. Born in the family of an Imperial Russian Minister of Interior, Dmitri Mirsky was a typical offspring of Intelligentsia - he was brilliantly educated, interested in poetry and languages. He fought in Denikin's army in the Russian Civil War and since 1922 he became interested in Eurasianism and became one of the founding members of the Eurasianist Party. Mirskiy became very intrigued by the victory of the syndicalists in France and was especially intersted in new forms of art developed in the socialist countries. His further support of the syndicalist regimes in the West only strengthened with inability of Kerensky's regime to improve the living standarts and cope with the economic depression in his Motherland. Moreover, he was as well disenchanted in Eurasianists, whom he saw as protectors of the ruling class of aristocracy. By 1936 Mirskiy founds himself as a strong Marxist, though still a prominent Eurasianist, ready to implement a great lean to the left if he will have a chance."
POLITICS_LEV_GUMILYOV_DESC:0 "Lev Gumilyov. Born in a family of famous poets, Nikolay Gumilyov and Anna Akhmatova, Lev was brought up in the manner of a typical Russian Intelligentsia - intersted in Liberal Arts, Languages and History of his Motherland. He early began interested in politics, and his especial interest was in Eurasianism - what he though to be a scientific approach to the roots of the Russian people. During the early 1930s Gumilyov has taken about 3 geological and ethographic expeditions to Central Asia and Mongolia. By 1934 he also became enlisted in the Eurasianist Party, becoming the leader of the youth movement of the party - Union of Eurasian Youth or Young Eurasianists. Gumilyov proved himself to be an ambitious and passionate leader with a reputation of a brilliant historian and Eurasianist pioneer. In 1936 Lev Gumilyov is a member of the so-called 'Council of Five' - a council of top-ranking Eurasianist leaders, among whom there are Nikolai Trubetzkoy, Pyetr Savitskiy, Georgiy Vernadskiy and Dmitriy Mirskiy. With great ambitions stored in his mind, Gumilyov has a plan to expand his powers as a leader of the youth movement - even if the price is high."

eurasiafor.53.d:0 "Of course, along with Mongolia's integration directly into Eurasia, the question arose of whose control these territories would remain under. On the one hand, if we arrest Baron Ungern, we will violate the agreements under which his fiefdom exists. In this regard, we can leave everything as it is, and let the Baron do what he wants in these territories. On the other hand, a mad Baron can be dangerous. Under his control is an army of thousands of selected Mongolian soldiers, ready to kill for their leader if something goes wrong. Therefore, you can quietly remove the Baron and appoint someone of your own to command the Mongolian Autonomous Region."
eurasiafor.53.a:0 "Let the madman rule in his fiefdom."

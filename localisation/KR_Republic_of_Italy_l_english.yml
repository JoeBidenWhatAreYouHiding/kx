### Leaders ###
POLITICS_IVANOE_BONOMI_DESC:0 "When the Sicilians and Sardinians withdrew from the Italian Federation, then Prime Minister of the Federation Ivanoe Bonomi dissolved the Federation in 1930. Subsequently elected Prime Minister of the new Italian Republic, Bonomi's willingness to work with the much-maligned Austria, while economically beneficial, continues to draw great internal scrutiny. Bonomi struggles to weather these increasingly virulent criticisms while cementing the republic's political institutions."

### Ideas ###
ITA_austrian_occupation_idea:0 "The Austrian 'Occupation'"
ITA_austrian_occupation_idea_desc:0 "Lombardy–Venetia was occupied by the Austrians following the collapse of the so-called 'Italian Federation' to protect their interests in their region and prevent the Socialists from gaining additional territory. Only managing to avoid full-scale rebellion due to cutting a deal with Liberal and Republican Elements, Lombardy-Venetia is among the most confusing pieces of the Austro-Hungarian puzzle, with even the Civilian Government being confused by the situation at play. The status of Lombardy–Venetia remains a hotly contested topic in both Vienna and Venice, as Governor Artur Schuschnigg has repeatedly delayed debates about the territory's status on the advice of the Foreign Ministry in Vienna. The ever complex status of the Lombardy–Venetia has caused no shortage of discontent, and has had the effect of further destabilizing the already tottering Austrian Empire. The Civilian Government, while holding a great deal of responsibility on paper, has often found itself sidelined in favour of Vienna's machinations, further fueling discontent. Any event that sees to shake the Austrian sphere may also have the effect of finally forcing Austria to reckon with the fate of one of their most unruly holdings."
ITA_deal_with_the_devil_idea:0 "The Deal with the Devil"
ITA_deal_with_the_devil_idea_desc:0 "The abdication of Vittorio Emanuele III and later Italian Revolution fueled the already significant nascent Republican Movement within Italy. Of course, the later full fledged turn towards Syndicalism espoused by the Republican elements which took hold put a damper on those who opposed the Monarchy yet wished to maintain a democratic system as it stood. The later collapse of the Austrian-backed 'Italian Federation' provided a new opportunity for those Democratic Republicans, who cut a deal with the Vienna controlled Governorate of Lombardy–Venetia to help ensure stability in the land beyond the Isonzo. The Austrians would allow a Republic, nominally loyal to Vienna and led in an official capacity by an Austrian Governor to form, and in exchange the Republicans would be allowed to operate a democratic Republic in the area and help keep the area stable. This compromise, while palatable to some, has come at the noticeable distaste to both the Monarchists, who wish to give the Italian Federation concept another try, and the Nationalists, who despise the deal on account of allowing Austria to lord over Italian affairs once more."
ITA_republic_federation:0 "The Unstable Republic"
ITA_republic_federation_desc:0 "When our nation was saved by Austria in 1920, the Habsburgs forced us to give much power to our constituent states, especially Veneto, as part of the Italian Federation. However, this has been adjourned for six years, effectively disbanded, creating a confusing bureaucratic situation. The opposition also causes no end of trouble, with some calling for the Federation's restoration and some calling for an end to democracy and Austrian influence altogether. The political situation is unlikely to stabilize any time soon."
ITA_republic_unitary:0 "The New Unitary Republic"
ITA_republic_unitary_desc:0 "The power of the states has been curtailed, and all authority now rests with the central government - a government which has eliminated elections and declared itself above responsibility to the people, for the good of the entire country. While the ANI enjoys a great deal of support, there is still considerable resistance to this new government - particularly from the republicans and old monarchists in the country's former states."
ITA_federation_transition:0 "The Federation Restored"
ITA_federation_transition_desc:0 "Now that the power of the Federation Council has been restored, we face the long and difficult task of getting the people and civil service to accept as their government what they once thought of as a museum piece."
ITA_federation_secure:0 "The Federation Rejuvenated"
ITA_federation_secure_desc:0 "The authority of the Federation Council is mostly undisputed, both internationally and internally. The Council now looks to the restitution of its members' former lands." 
ITA_austrian_influence:0 "Austrian Influence"
ITA_austrian_influence_desc:0 "Austria's influence is felt at every level of our nation, from its ownership over many of our companies to the loyalty owed by many of our most highly-placed politicians. Resentment against that influence is high, for even if they have protected us against the syndicalists they are still responsible for our loss in the Weltkrieg. Even so, cutting ties with Austria will prove a difficult and costly task."

ITA_REP_military_loyalty:0 "Loyal Military"

### Events ###

ita.1.t:0 "The History of the Italian Federation: Failure and Civil War"
ita.1.d:0 "With the French defeat and the fall of Rome in 1920, an exhausted Italy was left at the mercy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, seemingly destined to be forcibly reorganized into a federation of pre-unification states. Just a year after our humiliating defeat, a coalition of socialists and nationalists proclaimed the new Republic of Italy in Torino, which maintained that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. All over Italy republicans and socialists rose up against the Central Powers. Austria's plans for reorganizing Italy were quickly torn to pieces. However, despite initial successes, our Federation began defeating the Republic on every front. It seemed as if the Republic would cease to exist. However, with help from the Communards in Paris, they were able to evacuate to the South, which was left unoccupied by Austria, leaving the moderates and nationalists to die."
ita.1.a:0 "Terrible."

ita.22.t:0 "The History of the Italian Federation: The Southern Defeat"
ita.22.d:0 "As the civil war dragged on, the Austrians and their garrisons came to fight alongside the Federalists, finding a common enemy in the New Republic and their French supporters. After a victory at the Po against the Socialists, the Federalist and Austrian forces found themselves forced to swallow the bitter pill of prolonged cooperation. The new Federation was forced to sign the Treaty of Vienna, which balkanized the Kingdom, and forced the king to abdicate; as well as allowing the Austrian Empire to occupy Venice for twenty years. Afterwards to make up for this, the Austrians invited the Pope to lead the Federation.\nThis carefully balanced arrangement fell apart in 1922, however, when the socialists were able to successfully invade Naples, and establish a powerbase in Southern Italy. The Socialists were emboldened and there was talk of war, but the Austrians withdrew their army from Italy to deal with internal issues. This threw the peninsula into chaos, our armies were exhausted and unwilling to fight their brothers, which inevitably led to a ceasefire."
ita.22.a:0 "Interesting."

ita.18.t:0 "The History of the Italian Federation: The Risorgimento"
ita.18.d:0 "Though at considerable cost to national pride, the Austrian connection slowly improved the economic standing of the Federation, which drew strength from the German Mitteleuropa and Austrian investment.  As Italy recovered from the civil war's destruction, however, many in the Federation began to rue their government's deal with the Habsburgs, and popular support for Gsbriele d'Annuzio's anti-Austrian Associazione Nazionalista Italiana (Italian Nationalist Association) grew in Lombardy and Piedmont. \n\nPius XI has ruled the country since formation, but his health is declining rapidly, and should something happen to him, the Government, and the Federation as a whole would be thrown into chaos. One thing every Italian has in common is a desire for a free, united Italy, however, and many are sure a second Risorgimento is coming."
ita.18.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

ita.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the Federation"
ita.2.d:0 "The economic crisis that started in Germany has spiralled out of control and has spread to Italy. The Federation's prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and the confidence in the government has been shaken."
ita.2.a:0 "May God Protect us!"

ita.3.t:0 "Ivanoe Bonomi calls for a General Election"
ita.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting the Republic of Italy, Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi has decided to call for an early general election. Elections will be held in 1936 instead of 1937 as was scheduled. Hopefully, with this election, the Prime Minister will be able to shore up support for his policies to resolve the economic crisis."
ita.3.a:0 "Hopefully..."

ita.4.t:0 "Balbo's Speech"
ita.4.d:0 "Italo Balbo of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana delivered a speech in the city of Verona today. During the speech, he blamed the government of the republic for causing the economic crisis. Moreover, he went on to describe Austria's role in keeping Italy divided and weak, and that the syndicalists were only allowed to continue to exist as a foil to the Republic. Balbo promises that it is only the ANI that is able to restore Italy to glory and destroy all her enemies."
ita.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on him"

ita.5.t:0 "The Church Comments on the Crisis"
ita.5.d:0 "A number of influential figures within the church have been rallying support for political figures during their sermons. Of particular note are the Archbishops of Milan and Venice, who have urged parishioners to follow traditional catholic values during this crisis, a none too subtle nod of support for the conservative Popolare Italiano party. However some bishops, though not as influential as those in Milan and Venice, have instead urged support for Catholic Social Teaching and the ruling Liberal Democratic party. In both cases, people are listening to the advice of the church."
ita.5.a:0 "Let us hope the Church is right"

ita.6.t:0 "Rosselli Supports Bonomi"
ita.6.d:0 "Carlo Rosselli, leader of the Lega Democratica Riformista, the Social Democratic party in coalition with Ivanoe Bonomi, has given a speech in Milan supporting the prime minister. This has given valuable support to the besieged ruling party."
ita.6.a:0 "Thank you, Rosselli"

ita.7.t:0 "Protests Against Farm Auctions"
ita.7.d:0 "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages, and their livestock and property are normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practice is deeply unpopular among Italian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Italian People's Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the government's position on the issue?"
ita.7.a:0 "Allow the auctions to continue"
ita.7.b:0 "Pass the bill and ban the auctions"

ita.8.t:0 "Influence in the Milan Government"
ita.8.d:0 "In 1919, we forced the Kingdom of Italy to sign the Treaty of Rome, which reorganized Italy into a Federation, led by the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany. In the following civil war, however, we allied with the White rebel faction and together we barely held the socialists at the Po, ending the war. Subsequently, we forced the Whites to formally renounce their nationalist claims and, as the Republics of Lombardy and Venice, join the Federation. We did concede that a Republican leader would be the interim head of the Federation, though the Federation Council would retain some power behind the scenes. Unfortunately, the Federation Council was allowed to lapse in 1929, and has not been renewed since. Even worse, we recently withdrew our military from their nation due to the Black Monday crisis, leaving them far more independent than they were.\n\nNow the current liberal government under Ivanoe Bonomi has pushed forward the election in a bid for more support in the legislature. However, their victory is not a sure thing, and we have some leeway to influence the election. The three moderate parties that have a real chance at winning are the Liberal Democrats, currently in power, the People's Party, a conservative party who has enjoyed our support in the past, and the Italian Republicans, hostile to monarchy but also vehemently anti-ANI and anti-socialist. We can give our support and backing to one of the pro-Austrian political parties to ensure that the right one takes power in Milan. Some ministers, however, are concerned that overt involvement might result in further support for the far right and anti-Austrian Italian Nationalist Association."
ita.8.a:0 "Support the Liberal Democrats"
ita.8.b:0 "Support the People's Party"
ita.8.e:0 "Overt influence would merely empower the ANI"

ita.9.t:0 "Austria Supports the Liberal Democrats"
ita.9.d:0 "The Austrians have given support to the ruling Liberal Democrats in an attempt to help them win the election. While this has indeed had the intended effect, and encouraged more support for the ruling Liberal Democrats, it has also drawn far more attention to the far right and Anti-Austrian ANI party."

Firstly, the liberal democratic coalition under Prime Minister Bonomi can continue, or a liberal coalition led by the anti-autocratic and center-left Liberale Italiano party could ride to victory. Alternately, the conservative coalition led by the Popolare Italiano could be victorious, but few can afford to forget the surprisingly popular Associazione Nazionalista Italiana.

This notion has already been denounced by right-wing members of parliament as 'siding with syndicalism', and suggest they should be de-collectivized and privatized.

Italy cannot afford to weaken itself to greed and outside loyalties, not now and perhaps not ever.

Venetia has called for our help, though we must wait at least a few months before we can directly intervene without it appearing like we are interested only in conquest. If we do intervene, many within the Austrian government are suggesting that our only interest would be in restoring the old Italian Federation, this time under a Habsburg ruler.

It is highly unusual that a lady would make such a request, and a number of ministers believe that she should be refused. However, as a personal friend, the great statesman Italo Balbo believes that a compromise could be reached where she can lead a force of female aviators to fly non-combat missions.

The Greenshirts are organised in a military fashion modelled on the Arditi soldiers, which also extends to the Uniforms.

ita.82.d.yes_i_can:0 "The Austrians have sent us an ultimatum. With [SRI.GetNameDef] no longer around, we are no longer a necessary bulwark against syndicalism, and so they seek to make us empower the long behind the scenes Federation Council.

ita.97.t:0 "Liberation of Brescia"
ita.97.d:0 "We finally were able to liberate the city of Brescia from the ANI scum. The battle was bloody and fighting was block by bloody block but we were able to drive them out of the city.

Today the Army is being welcomed as the real liberators of the city."

ita.98.t:0 "Ringleaders caught"

It was directed by Romolo Marcellini, and stars Fosco Giachetti, Luisa Ferida, and Osvaldo Valenti and funded by the ANI.

The Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti or just 'Enciclopedia Italiana' for short is a 35 volume encyclopedia of the sciences and arts.

ita.120.t:0 "The War Against Italy"
ita.120.d:0 "We are losing badly in the war against [ITA.GetNameDef]. While it's possible we might still be able to turn things around, we do have another option: offer them our lands in southern Tyrol and the Littoral, and hope they will take that offer and leave us be. If they do not... it is entirely possible they might reach all the way to Vienna, and then our empire is lost to us for good."

ita.122.t:0 "Venetia is Lost"
ita.122.d:0 "The war against [ITA.GetNameDef] has definitely not gone as planned. We were unable to prevent them from overtaking Venetia, and now we must make the decision whether to continue the war or pull out completely and leave Italy to its own fate. Any peace could be temporary, of course - it's not impossible that the Italians could turn around and attack us again, but perhaps the breather would be worth it?"

ita.150.t:0 "Withdrawal from the Italian Republic"
ita.150.d:0 "Black Monday has hit [AUS.GetNameDef] hard... hard enough that many of our companies have been forced to withdraw from [ITA.GetNameDef]. Not only has our economic hold over the Italians weakened, we also cannot afford to maintain our occupation forces there. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent. We will have to maintain a working relationship with them, at least until we can restore our own strength."
ita.150.a:0 "Our sphere of influence retracts."

ita.151.t:0 "The Austrian Withdrawal"
ita.151.d:0 "Black Monday has hit [AUS.GetNameDef] hard. Their markets have plunged so low that many Austrian stockholders of Austro-Italian companies have panicked and sold countless bonds to native Italians, weakening the Austrian stranglehold over our economy. Not only have we rid ourselves of foreign economic influence, the Austro-Hungarian Reichskriegsminister has recalled the divisions stationed in our territory, unable to afford the financial burden of keeping us safe from what many in Vienna foolishly believe to be an empty Socialist threat. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent of Austrian domination, at least until they regain their full strength. Many Italians are worried about whether or not this will leave us exposed to attack by [SRI.GetNameDef]. A war right now would be a terrible prospect."

ita.152.t:0 "ANI Protests Elections"
ita.152.d:0 "Massive demonstrations were held today in Milan as well as other cities throughout [Root.GetNameDef], with ANI leader Italo Balbo accusing the government of rigging the elections with Austrian assistance. Austrian influence is felt everywhere throughout the country, Balbo said, and suggested that Italians would never have true independence until they overthrew their oppressors. While Balbo has yet to show any true evidence of rigging, his words still found many eager listeners... and there is a growing concern that his cadre of followers might cause trouble for the government."
ita.152.a:0 "Outlaw the ANI and shut them down."

ita.153.d:0 "In response to the recent government crackdown, Italo Balbo's most ardent supporters within the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, dubbed 'Greenshirts' by the media, have been spreading chaos throughout the nation. Already they have been directly implicated in two riots and several bombings, with posters accusing the Italian government of conspiracy and selling out to foreign interests being plastered everywhere in the capital. Their wave of chaos is spreading, and many are accusing Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] of incompetence for taking too strong a stance against the ANI and provoking the violence."
ita.153.a:0 "How long will this go on?"

ita.154.t:0 "Anti-Government Demonstrations"
ita.154.d:0 "As the terror campaign by the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana continues, protests against the government's inept handling of the violence have erupted throughout the country. The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not round up the ANI ringleaders soon. Despite the protests, it is clear that the police actions against Balbo's group are having limited effect - indeed, he appears to be gaining as many followers as he loses to the mass arrests."

ita.155.d:0 "With the government crackdown growing more severe in recent days, Italo Balbo called on his supporters to march on the parliament building in Milan today - provoking a massive demonstration which turned into a full-on battle in the middle of the city as the police and military took prompt action. With hundreds of casualties, Balbo and his supporters were eventually dispersed. Italo Balbo remains at large, however, and despite his failure to enact a coup there are now calls for the government to step down. Opposition parties claim the republic is in chaos and intend to force a vote of confidence in the Italian parliament as soon as possible."
ita.155.a:0 "At least Balbo is out of the picture."

ita.156.t:0 "The Vote of Confidence"
ita.156.d:0 "Today the vote of confidence will be held in the Italian parliament. At stake is the very survival of the republic - if the government falls, it will be a clear sign that the system is considered dysfunctional, and many are reluctant to turn to yet another chaotic election campaign. Indeed, members of the nobility have been gathering supporters around them and are already suggesting that an empowerment of the monarchical Federation Council might be preferable. The threat of this has pulled other officials to call for votes in support of the government, no matter what."
ita.156.a:0 "The government narrowly survives the vote."
ita.156.b:0 "The government falls."

ita.157.t:0 "Return to the Federation?"
ita.157.d:0 "With the government fallen and faith in the republic destroyed, there are two options for how the government can proceed. One is to restore the power of the Federation, where members of the nobility would take up administrative posts on the Federal Council, to be led either by the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany, Giuseppe Ferdinando, or Count Adriano Visconti of Lombardy. Elections would be restricted throughout parts of the country and democracy as we know it would end. While many favor the stability that route would bring, there are others, among them Venetian nationalists, who suggest disbanding the Federation in its entirety - the states of Venetia and Lombardy would become independent entities, even though such a separation might only prove an opportunity for outside forces to pounce."
ita.157.a:0 "Restore the Federation under the Grand Duke of Tuscany."

ita.158.t:0 "ANI Recruiting in the Military"
ita.158.d:0 "The popularity of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana continues to grow unchecked, and now it appears Italo Balbo has been campaigning hard amongst the generals of the Republican army. It is unknown whether any have agreed to join his cause, but rancor against the government has been increasing and many officials fear a coup could be in the offing. Taking a stand against the ANI now, however, could provoke the kind of violence which might drive the army towards supporting Balbo even if they weren't already considering it. What shall we do?"
ita.158.a:0 "We must act now, no matter the consequences."
ita.158.b:0 "Campaign for our own support and prepare for the worst."

ita.159.t:0 "Massive ANI Demonstrations"
ita.159.d:0 "As support for the ANI increases, and violent riots in [ITA.GetNameDef] become commonplace, protests against the government's inept handling of the situation have erupted throughout the country. The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not deal with the ANI ringleaders soon. Protestors are suggesting that the government's inaction is tantamount to incompetence."
ita.159.a:0 "We are doing the best we can!"

ita.160.t:0 "The March on Milan"
ita.160.d:0 "Italo Balbo, leader of the ANI, today called for a massive march on the royal palace in Milan, suggesting that a show of force is the only way to force the government to resign and clear the country of Austrian influence and corruption. The crowds pouring into the central square are massive, and as the Italian police and military move in it is clear that the resulting bloodshed will be horrific. Already, even before it is determined whether Balbo's coup might be successful, there are members of the opposition calling for a vote of confidence concerning the government's handling of the situation. Such calls might be moot, however, if Balbo's sheer numbers win the day..."

ita.161.d:0 "While the leader of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, Italo Balbo, remains at large, today it was announced that most of his co-conspirators in the nationwide terror campign have finally been captured. Most are now awaiting trial, while the country breathes a sigh of relief. Many consider this to be a sign that the worst of [ITA.GetNameDef]'s political struggles are over."

italianrepublic.1.t:0 "The History of the Republic of Italy: Defeat and Civil War"
italianrepublic.1.d:0 "With the French defeat and the collapse of the Italian war effort, the Austrians and the Kingdom of Italy signed an armistice in August 1919, in which the Austrians were allowed to garrison Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. Mere days after the humiliating announcement of peace, enraged nationalists proclaimed the new Republic of Italy in Milan, which maintained that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. All over Italy republicans and nationalists rose up against the kingdom, and even the abdication of King Victor Emanuel and his son wasn’t enough to stop the collapse of royal authority. After pushing the royalists out of much of Central and Northern Italy it became apparent that the rivalries between differing factions in the republic were too great to reconcile, and what started with small acts of sabotage become a full-fledged conflict between Red and White forces, grinding the offensives against the monarchists to a halt."
italianrepublic.1.a:0 "Terrible."

italianrepublic.22.t:0 "The Status of the Republic of Italy: The Federation Failure"
italianrepublic.22.d:0 "As the civil war dragged on, the tides of war turned against the Whites, and when Austria offered the republicans help in exchange for joining in a common state with the royalists in the south, the republicans had no choice but to accept, or face destruction. After a victory at the Po against the Socialists, the White and Austrian forces found themselves forced to swallow the bitter pill of prolonged cooperation. The Republic was obliged to legally join the Italian Federation under Austrian protection. They also granted significant autonomy to Veneto and much influence in the government to the Austrians and the Council of the Italian Federation. In exchange, however, the Prime Minister of the Republic was granted the title Interim Head of the Italian Federation.\n\nThis carefully balanced arrangement fell apart in 1926, however, when the Union of Britain joined the Third Internationale. The Socialists were emboldened and there was talk of war, but the Austrians made it clear that their forces would make no move to attack the socialists if the south came under attack. This threw the peninsula into chaos, and gave the Sicilians and Savoyards, long dissatisfied with the pro-Milan balance in the Council of the Italian Federation, the chance to walk out. Though the socialists never attacked, the Council now clearly served no purpose, and its ten-year term was allowed to expire in 1930. While the halls of civilian power in Milan bustle with activity and ambition, the Council Chamber now stands empty."

italianrepublic.18.t:0 "The Status of the Republic of Italy: Recovery and Risorgimento"
italianrepublic.18.d:0 "Though at considerable cost to national pride, the Austrian connection slowly improved the economic standing of the Republic, which drew strength from the German Mitteleuropa and Austrian investment.  As Italy recovered from the civil war's destruction, however, many in the Republic began to rue their government's deal with the Habsburgs, and popular support for Italo Balbo's anti-Austrian Associazione Nazionalista Italiana (Italian Nationalist Association) grew in Lombardy and Friuli. \n\nIvanoe Bonomi's center-left coalition has ruled the country since 1927, but their popularity is mainly due to the economic stability, and should that end other parties such as the staunchly republican Partito Liberale Italiano or conservative Partito Popolare Italiano might gain enough support to form a government. Should matters get completely out of hand and Federation-aligned forces restore order in the north by force, even the old Council of the Italian Federation might take power. One thing all parties have in common is a desire for a free, united Italy, however, and many are sure a second Risorgimento is coming."

italianrepublic.8.t:0 "Influence in the Italian Government"
italianrepublic.8.d:0 "In 1919, we signed an armistice with the Kingdom of Italy, which allowed us to garrison Lombardy and Venetia until a treaty was signed. The Italians were little pleased with this defeat, and rose up in revolution against their Savoyard monarch. Soon, he and his son abdicated, and there was a power vacuum in Italy, as socialist rebels seemed primed to overrun the entire nation. We offered the desperate Italians the aid of our armies in stopping the socialist advance, in exchange for joining a new Italian Federation, a legitimate government we could deal with. The Savoyards, White republicans, and southern forces agreed to our terms, and our armies pushed the socialists out of Lombardy. We did concede to the republicans that a republican leader would be the interim head of the Federation, though the Federation Council would retain some power behind the scenes. However, when the socialists made moves to attack the southern states of the Federation in 1926, we were embroiled in the Illyrian crisis, and could not promise to attack the socialists in support. Outraged, Sardinia, the Bourbons in Naples, and even the Holy Father himself abandoned our Federation, leaving us with only Milan. Unfortunately, the Federation Council there was allowed to lapse in 1930, and has not been renewed since. Even worse, we recently withdrew our military from their nation due to the Black Monday crisis, leaving them far more independent than they were.\n\nNow the current liberal government under Ivanoe Bonomi has pushed forward the election in a bid for more support in the legislature. However, their victory is not a sure thing, and we have some leeway to influence the election. The three moderate parties that have a real chance at winning are the Liberal Democrats, currently in power, the People's Party, a conservative party who has enjoyed our support in the past, and the Italian Republicans, hostile to monarchy but also vehemently anti-ANI and anti-socialist. We can give our support and backing to one of the pro-Austrian political parties to ensure that the right one takes power in Milan. Some ministers, however, are concerned that overt involvement might result in further support for the far right and anti-Austrian Italian Nationalist Association."

italianrepublic.51.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

italianrepublic.52.t:0 "The Battle for the Grain"
italianrepublic.52.d:0 "Following the success of the Battle for the Land comes the Battle for the Grain. The new farmlands will be made to support the growing population of Italy and her armies. An army marches on its stomach after all and the Italian army will be marching to war."

italianrepublic.53.t:0 "The Battle for the Births"
italianrepublic.53.d:0 "The final of the economic battles is the Battle of the Births. This is a program designed to help couples have more children.

Through such a policy the future generations of Italy shall be created and secured."
italianrepublic.53.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

italianrepublic.54.t:0 "The Unitary Republic"
italianrepublic.54.d:0 "The laws have been passed swiftly in the capital, rescinding the rights and autonomies enjoyed by Lombardy and Venetia - or, indeed, any state that is part of the republic. The ANI party line is that this is 'for the good of the country', an explanation which also applies to the suspension of future elections. Italy cannot afford to weaken itself to greed and outside loyalties, not now and perhaps not ever. This news has not gone over well in Venetia, however, where the state legislators have expressed fury as what they see as a power grab by the central government. Already people are taking to the streets, and we may expect more formal action to be taken in the days to come."
italianrepublic.54.a:0 "Let's hope this amounts to nothing"

italianrepublic.55.t:0 "Riots in Venice"
italianrepublic.55.d:0 "Opposition to the unitary republic has grown throughout Italy, with much of it concentrated in the city of Venice. There, Partito Republicano Veneto leader Giuseppe Volpi has given fiery speeches denouncing the ANI and calling on 'loyal Venetians' to rise up and fight against its tyranny. Riots have broken out throughout the city, with violence concentrated against central government offices and troops. Officials fear it is just a matter of days before the state legislature takes a vote on whether or not to withdraw from the republic."
italianrepublic.55.a:0 "Let them shout, this will amount to nothing!"
italianrepublic.55.b:0 "We cannot risk anything! Occupy Venetia!"

italianrepublic.56.t:0 "The Venetian Revolt"
italianrepublic.56.d:0 "As predicted, the vote in Venice - with the controlling Partito Republicano Veneto voting unanimously in favor - has led to the declaration of their opposition to the unitary republic. Until, and if, state rights are restored they will see the Republic of Venice separated from [ITA.GetNameDef]. Last-minute talks are being held, but at the moment all government troops are being ordered out of Venetia, and militia forces are quickly being assembled - most likely with aid and assistance by the Austrians."

italianrepublic.56.b:0 "Fight for La Serrenisima! (Play as the Venice)"

italianrepublic.57.t:0 "The Venetian Revolt"
italianrepublic.57.d:0 "It appears the experiment of the Italian Republic is truly over. With the ANI having won the Italian elections, they have attempted to turn the nation into a unitary republic, stripping the composite states of their rights - and now Venetia has rebelled against them. Venetia has called for our help, though we must wait at least a few months before we can directly intervene without it appearing like we are interested only in conquest. If we do intervene, many within the Austrian government are suggesting that our only interest would be in restoring the old Italian Federation, this time under a Habsburg ruler. Indeed, the Italians are so fed up with this failure of democracy, they might welcome such an option with open arms."
italianrepublic.57.a:0 "We will need to watch this carefully"

italianrepublic.58.t:0 "War with Venice"
italianrepublic.58.d:0 "The Venetian rebellion grows even worse and armed militias are forcing out loyal and patriotic Italians. This can not stand. We must move quickly - if we do not demonstrate within a matter of months that we have the situation under control, we run the risk of interventions by the Austrians or, far worse, the Socialist Republic of Italy feeling bold enough to attack without drawing international ire."

italianrepublic.60.t:0 "The Verona Trials"
italianrepublic.60.d:0 "Today in the city of Verona the trial for the leaders of the Socialist Republic of Italy is has begun.

Syndicalism is now dead."

italianrepublic.61.t:0 "Let Carina Massone Negrone Fly?"
italianrepublic.61.d:0 "With the republic now at war, Carina Massone Negrone has asked to fly for the Republic's Air Force. It is highly unusual that a lady would make such a request, and a number of ministers believe that she should be refused. However, as a personal friend, the great statesman Italo Balbo believes that a compromise could be reached where she can lead a force of female aviators to fly non-combat missions. This would allow more men to actually fly."
italianrepublic.61.a:0 "Let her fly!"

italianrepublic.64.d:0 "The Opera Nazionale Balilla was recently created by order from Il Duce. Taking its name from the nickname of the Italian boy which started a revolt against Hapsburg forces during the war of Austrian succession. The organisation is similar to a scouting group for children. The organisation has two similar structures one for boys and the other for girls with both being divided into three groups for different age brackets. The organisation is to help prepare the future youth to the roles that they will have within society as well as make sure that they are loyal Italians."

italianrepublic.67.t:0 "Green or Blue?"
italianrepublic.67.d:0 "The official colours of the Italian football team have been blue, descended from the colours of the Kingdom of Italy. Now that we are in power, we have the ability to finally change the colours away from blue to green to better reflect the colours of Italy instead of the house of Savoy. However, this will likely upset a number of fans who like the colour blue."
italianrepublic.67.a:0 "We shall keep the colours."
italianrepublic.67.b:0 "We shall switch colours."

italianrepublic.68.t:0 "Greenshirt Brigades"
italianrepublic.68.d:0 "The Greenshirts, founded during the Civil War, are formally the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (Voluntary Militia for National Security) or MVSN for short, but are most often called by their informal name due to their distinctive green shirts. The Greenshirts are organised in a military fashion modelled on the Arditi soldiers, which also extends to the Uniforms. While they have been muscle for the ANI for some time, now that we are at war, they have stepped up to defend the republic from all enemies."

We must request that they reorganize their government to be more like the Federation they ostensibly are."
italianrepublic.81.d.yes_i_can:0 "With the godless syndicalists in the Socialist Republic of Italy now destroyed, the question of what to do about the Republic of Italy has arisen. The threat of the Socialist Republic of Italy has always kept the alliance in check and the Republic acted as a bulwark against the tide of Syndicalism. Now that threat is gone, and the question is whether should we send an ultimatum to demand that the Republic reform into a Federation, something that will be more acceptable to Vienna. Alternately, we could always drop the matter."

italianrepublic.82.d.yes_i_can:0 "The Austrians have sent us an ultimatum. With [SRI.GetNameDef] no longer around, we are no longer a necessary bulwark against syndicalism, and so they seek to make us empower the long behind the scenes Federation Council.

Not only have we rid ourselves of foreign economic influence, the Austro-Hungarian Reichskriegsminister has recalled the divisions stationed in our territory, unable to afford the financial burden of keeping us safe from what many in Vienna foolishly believe to be an empty Socialist threat. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent of Austrian domination, at least until they regain their full strength.

Despite the protests, it is clear that the police actions against Balbo's group are having limited effect - indeed, he appears to be gaining as many followers as he loses to the mass arrests."
italianrepublic.154.a:0 "We are doing what we can!"

italianrepublic.155.t:0 "The March on Milan Fails"
italianrepublic.155.d:0 "With the government crackdown growing more severe in recent days, Italo Balbo called on his supporters to march on the parliament building in Milan today - provoking a massive demonstration which turned into a full-on battle in the middle of the city as the police and military took prompt action. With hundreds of casualties, Balbo and his supporters were eventually dispersed. Italo Balbo remains at large, however, and despite his failure to enact a coup there are now calls for the government to step down. Opposition parties claim the republic is in chaos and intend to force a vote of confidence in the Italian parliament as soon as possible."
italianrepublic.155.a:0 "At least Balbo is out of the picture."

italianrepublic.156.t:0 "The Vote of Confidence"
italianrepublic.156.d:0 "Today the vote of confidence will be held in the Italian parliament. At stake is the very survival of the republic - if the government falls, it will be a clear sign that the system is considered dysfunctional, and many are reluctant to turn to yet another chaotic election campaign. Indeed, members of the nobility have been gathering supporters around them and are already suggesting that an empowerment of the monarchical Federation Council might be preferable. The threat of this has pulled other officials to call for votes in support of the government, no matter what."
italianrepublic.156.a:0 "The government narrowly survives the vote."
italianrepublic.156.b:0 "The government falls."

italianrepublic.157.t:0 "Return to the Federation?"
italianrepublic.157.d:0 "With the government fallen and faith in the republic destroyed, there are two options for how the government can proceed. One is to restore the power of the Federation, where members of the nobility would take up administrative posts on the Federal Council, to be led either by the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany, Giuseppe Ferdinando, or Count Adriano Visconti of Lombardy. Elections would be restricted throughout parts of the country and democracy as we know it would end. While many favor the stability that route would bring, there are others, among them Venetian nationalists, who suggest disbanding the Federation in its entirety - the states of Venetia and Lombardy would become independent entities, even though such a separation might only prove an opportunity for outside forces to pounce."
italianrepublic.157.a:0 "Restore the Federation under the Grand Duke of Tuscany."
italianrepublic.157.b:0 "Restore the Federation under Count Visconti."
italianrepublic.157.c:0 "Disband the Republic completely."

italianrepublic.158.t:0 "ANI Recruiting in the Military"
italianrepublic.158.d:0 "The popularity of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana continues to grow unchecked, and now it appears Italo Balbo has been campaigning hard amongst the generals of the Republican army. It is unknown whether any have agreed to join his cause, but rancor against the government has been increasing and many officials fear a coup could be in the offing. Taking a stand against the ANI now, however, could provoke the kind of violence which might drive the army towards supporting Balbo even if they weren't already considering it. What shall we do?"
italianrepublic.158.a:0 "We must act now, no matter the consequences."
italianrepublic.158.b:0 "Campaign for our own support and prepare for the worst."

italianrepublic.159.t:0 "Massive ANI Demonstrations"
italianrepublic.159.d:0 "As support for the ANI increases, and violent riots in [ITA.GetNameDef] become commonplace, protests against the government's inept handling of the situation have erupted throughout the country. The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not deal with the ANI ringleaders soon. Protestors are suggesting that the government's inaction is tantamount to incompetence."
italianrepublic.159.a:0 "We are doing the best we can!"

italianrepublic.160.t:0 "The March on Milan"
italianrepublic.160.d:0 "Italo Balbo, leader of the ANI, today called for a massive march on the royal palace in Milan, suggesting that a show of force is the only way to force the government to resign and clear the country of Austrian influence and corruption. The crowds pouring into the central square are massive, and as the Italian police and military move in it is clear that the resulting bloodshed will be horrific. Already, even before it is determined whether Balbo's coup might be successful, there are members of the opposition calling for a vote of confidence concerning the government's handling of the situation. Such calls might be moot, however, if Balbo's sheer numbers win the day..."
italianrepublic.160.a:0 "Balbo's coup is successful."
italianrepublic.160.b:0 "Balbo and his supporters are dispersed."

italianrepublic.161.t:0 "ANI Ringleaders Finally Caught"
italianrepublic.161.d:0 "While the leader of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, Italo Balbo, remains at large, today it was announced that most of his co-conspirators in the nationwide terror campign have finally been captured. Most are now awaiting trial, while the country breathes a sigh of relief. Many consider this to be a sign that the worst of [ITA.GetNameDef]'s political struggles are over."

italianrepublic.171.d:0 "With a resurgence in irredentism since reuniting the country, [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [claimed_state.Owner.GetNameDef]. Since the state is already claimed by a member of the [Root.GetFactionName], the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided that its goals are incompatible with those of the alliance and has elected to withdraw.

italianrepublic.172.d:0 "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network preparing for the day when we and [ITA.GetNameDef] went to war.

italianrepublic.200.d:0 "Harukichi Shimoi, nicknamed the Samurai of Fiume and Comrade Samurai by his old friend D’Annunzio, has arrived in Italy once again after a brief stint back in his home of Fukuoka, Japan where he helped the Tokyo government establish the new Italian Embassy. A skilled warrior-poet and writer, Shimoi is a known fan of Italian culture, living in Naples for years and even taking an Italian woman as his wife. Holding anti-German and anti-Turkish sentiments due to his time fighting for Italy in the Great War as a pilot and Ardito, Shimoi has long thought of himself as an honorary Italian, and his old friends such as Mussolini, Balbo, and D’Annunzio all agree, even collaborating to help bring the Rome-Tokyo Raid come together in 1920, as performed by famed aviator and friend Arturo Ferrarin. Founding the Japanese literature magazine ‘Sakura’ following the Great War and after settling down, he would do his duties for both Italy and Japan while spreading the ideas of Bushido culture throughout areas of Italy while seeking to fuse his Japanese-based ideas with Italian ideas of Socialized Nationalism, National Populism, Totalism, and Legionearrism. Though getting on in years, Shimoi would still be a valuable asset to any force, and so we shall take him on as a military officer and advisor for the foreseeable future. Hopefully the Samurai of Fiume lives up to his name."
italianrepublic.200.a:0 "Comrade Samurai Shimoi shall be a fine addition to our military staff."

italianrepublic.201.t:0 "Moving on from D’Annunzio’s Death"
italianrepublic.201.d:0 "Tragedy has wracked the nation with the news that Gabriele D’Annunzio, Prince of Montenevoso, has passed away due to natural causes. The leader of the ANI and the most powerful man in our republic, the entire nation now mourns his loss. With the death of this great politician and poet, the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana has been cast adrift, and now it is up to the members of the ANI to debate amongst themselves in order to choose a D’Annunzio’s successor. Though the torch of D’Annunzio among Leftist circles is dominantly carried by Benito Mussolini, the same cohesion and unity is absent here in our federation, for D’Annunzio has two likely successors here. The leader of the Republican faction of the ANI is Italo Balbo, while Count Galeazzo Ciano leads their rivals in ANI’s monarchist wing. Only one can rise to lead the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana and wider Italy, so who shall lead us as we step towards our destiny?"
italianrepublic.201.a:0 "The Republicans under Italo Balbo win out."
italianrepublic.201.b:0 "Count Galeazzo Ciano and his aristocrats seize control of ANI."

italianrepublic.202.d:0 "With the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana’s decision to pronounce Count Galeazzo Ciano as Gabriele D’Annunzio’s rightful successor, Ciano has risen to the highest political position in Italy. However, debate now rages within the ANI - primarily within the Monarchist faction of Ciano now in control - as to whether parliamentary monarchism should be reintroduced to Italy. If so, the House of Savoy would return as the rightful monarchs of our reborn kingdom. However, we could simply embrace our aristocratic and elitist traditions without fully dredging up an institution many within the ANI find outdated while still respecting the former royals and their place within our culture. What shall be the future of Italy’s political system as Ciano plays with the nation’s fate in the palm of his hands?"
italianrepublic.202.a:0 "The House of Savoy shall be reinstated as the true monarchs of Italy!"
italianrepublic.202.b:0 "We do not need to revive such outdated institutions."

italianrepublic.203.d:0 "The heavens cry torrential tears and let loose their thunderous wailings, for our beloved King Viittorio Emanuele Ferdinando Maria Gennaro di Savoia has finally passed away. The famed Prince of Naples, the beloved Sciabolettea (Little Saber) or il Re soldato (the Soldier King), our beloved national father has been finally laid to rest after passing away in his sleep peacefully at the age of 78. As the government prepares to lay the former monarch to rest in a lavish and respectful ceremony, and as the clergy and aristocracy debate on whether to either bury him at the traditional resting place of the House of Savoy at Hautecombe Abbey in Southern France or in the Roman Pantheon here in Italy where his grandfather Victor Emanuel II and his father Umberto I are buried, the nation and the next king prepare for the future. \n\nNow, the late Victor Emmanuel’s only son Umberto Nicola Tommaso Giovanni Maria di Savoia shall rise to the throne as King Umberto II. Like most heirs in the House of Savoy’s history, Umberto has a background steeped in military education and experience, but is lacking in political knowledge due to the House of Savoy not teaching political matters to their issue, as it is expected each monarch will learn the political world after taking office. As such, Umberto II has a lot to learn about being a true king and political leader, but his military expertise shall aid Italy in our imperialist ambitions for years to come, or at least we hope."
italianrepublic.203.a:0 "Rest in peace King Vittorio Emanuele III; long live King Umberto II!"

italianrepublic.204.t:0 "Giuseppe Ferdinando I Passes Away"
italianrepublic.204.d:0 "The nation mourns as Archduke Joseph Ferdinand of Austria, better known as Giuseppe Ferdinando I, has passed away. Giuseppe Ferdinando had faced an uphill battle to earn the trust of the Italian people who viewed the new King as nothing more than a puppet of the Austrian Empire. Over time, Giuseppe Ferdinando had proved himself to be a compassionate, moral, and upstanding monarch, worthy of Italy’s respect. With the king’s passing, the title of head of Habsburg-Tuscany is passed down to Ferdinand’s brother Peter Ferdinand, who has chosen to rule as Pietro Ferdinando I."
italianrepublic.204.a:0 "An unlikely hero in Italy’s darkest hour."

italianrepublic.205.t:0 "Pietro Ferdinando I Passes Away"
italianrepublic.205.d:0 "The nation once again enters a state of mourning as Archduke Peter Ferdinand of Austria, known to his subjects as Pietro Ferdinando I, has passed away. Much like his brother, Pietro Ferdinando maintained a hands-off approach in his rule, leaving the day-to-day functions of the government to the Federal Council. While Pietro Ferdinando’s rule was mostly uneventful and his eccentricities were not as well known as his brother’s, he was well respected among the Italian people. With the king’s passing, the title of Grand Duke of Tuscany is passed down to his son Gottfried, who has chosen to rule as Goffredo I."

## descriptions ##

Pius_XI:0 "Pius XI"
POLITICS_PIUS_XI_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XI has been the pope since 1922. Due to his Italian ethnicity and papal authority, he was the one to unite the Italian states after the King's exile. He is loved by Catholics both in and outside Italy."
POLITICS_PIUS_XII_DESC:0 "Pope Piux XII, formerly Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli, is a man of great spiritual fervour. He is renowned for his piety, but has a strong authoritarian streak that is matched only by his desire to protect the people."
POLITICS_STEPHEN_X_DESC:0 "Pope Stephen X, formerly Elia Cardinal dalla Costa, is a gentle man renown for his charitable nature and love of the poor. Most assume he will eventually turn the Papacy away from its direct rule of the nation, and already forces are gathering within Italy to determine who will undertake that role."
POLITICS_JOHN_XXIII_DESC:0 "Pope John XXIII, formerly Achille Cardinal Liènart, is a controversial choice as Pope. He is a well-known socialist, considered by some to even be a radical, and it's possible he was chosen by the Papacy due to the possibility his socialist leanings will lead to a reconciliation with the south."
POLITICS_JULIUS_IV_DESC:0 "Pope Julius IV, formerly Theodor Cardinal Innitzer, is a man renowned for his passion. He has been involved in the running of the Italian Federation for many years, and has declared syndicalism to be an evil he will battle until it is eradicated from the Earth."

### Focuses ###
ITA_Black_Monday:0 "Aftermath of Black Monday"
ITA_Black_Monday_desc:0 "The entire nation has fallen into despair and unemployment with the collapse of the economy. Finding our way out will be a long road, though we are better off than some."
ITA_Road_Network:0 "Nationalize the Austrian Businesses"
ITA_Road_Network_desc:0 "The Austrian influence on our Federation is obvious to everyone, and as long as they continue to own large sectors of our economy, the Austrian bastards will continue to control our government. We must take the first step to a free Italy and nationalize our vital industries."
ITA_Pontine_Marshes:0 "Clear the Pontine Marshes"
ITA_Pontine_Marshes_desc:0 "The marshlands in the Lazio region of central Italy have stood since the time of the Romans. A concerted effort to clear them will provide ample farmland, as well as work for many thousands of idle hands."
ITA_Industrialisation:0 "Raise the Tariffs"
ITA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "If we are to get through this crisis, we must first cancel most of our foreign trades, which have done nothing but forced us to sink money into other countries, when we should be focusing on recovering from this depression."
ITA_Construction_Effort:0 "Develop Construction Capabilities"
ITA_Construction_Effort_desc:0 "Our current industrial capacity is a disgrace to our country. We must make sure we expand our industrial capabilities."
ITA_Construction_Effort_II:0 "Improve Industrial Development"
ITA_Construction_Effort_II_desc:0 "Clearly, more industry funding is necessary for Italy to become a real industrial force."
ITA_Armament_Effort:0 "Strive for Autarky"
ITA_Armament_Effort_desc:0 "Our natural resources are vastly under-developed. If we were to ever go to war with the South, we would be completely unprepared, as we would lack the resources to keep our factories up and running. In these troubling times we must attempt towards autarky by investing in our own resources, rather than continuing relying on allies that will surely betray us should war ever arrive."
ITA_Armament_Effort_II:0 "Fill the Oil reserves"
ITA_Armament_Effort_II_desc:0 "Modern Warfare requires oil to fuel your ships, your vehicles and your air force. We must be able to produce a steady supply of fuel for our military, and so we must begin building many oil refineries."
ITA_Black_Monday_Recovery:0 "Black Monday Recovery"
ITA_Black_Monday_Recovery_desc:0 "The burst of construction and development in our country has clearly been enough to spur Italy's recovery from financial nightmare. Let us all celebrate!"
ITA_National_Reconstruction_Program:0 "National Development Program"
ITA_National_Reconstruction_Program_desc:0 "Over the last few decades, our one great country fell into disrepair. Our historical monuments lie damaged, and areas like the Pontine Marshes stand in our further development. This must not stand! Let us amaze the world by improving our country in numerous ways in a record time."
ITA_Initiate_Risoregimento:0 "Initiate Risorgimento"
ITA_Initiate_Risoregimento_desc:0 "For years, we have been waiting for the right time to strike against the syndicalist menace in the south, and now the time has finally come! Our men have been trained, our industry has been bolstered, and our will to reunite the nation burns brighter than ever! For Italy!"
ITA_Propose_Union:0 "Propose Peaceful Reunion"
ITA_Propose_Union_desc:0 "The only thing that is preventing a peaceful reunion with the south is their syndicalist, totalitarian government. If that were to change..."
ITA_Incorporate_South:0 "Incorporate the South"
ITA_Incorporate_South_desc:0 "After many years, and a grueling war, we have finally defeated our rival government in the south and reunited Italy, with our soldiers marching on to quell what little resistance remains. Indeed, this is a historical moment for all Italians, but now we must consolidate our control over these liberated lands, and free its people from the oppression of the defeated government."
ITA_Irredentism:0 "Reclaim Italia Irredenta!"
ITA_Irredentism_desc:0 "While we may have taken back the south of Italy, we cannot stop and fully declare victory yet. Millions of Italians live outside of their homeland, under the banners of a foreign government, and in areas that are historically ours by right. We must be willing to press our claims and expand our borders to free our brothers and sisters!"
ITA_Lombardy_Tension:0 "Remilitarized Lombardy" #world tension
ITA_Claim_Northeast:0 "Rescue the Northeast"
ITA_Claim_Northeast_desc:0  "A sore reminder of our past failures still remains in the Northeast, with Austrian boots in Venice. This cannot be the case any longer, and already many Italians across the nation have called for us to liberate our loyal citizens and reclaim Venice, Fiume, and other lands that were once ours. Now is the time for retribution!"
ITA_Claim_Italian_Switzerland:0 "Minorities in Ticino"
ITA_Claim_Italian_Switzerland_desc:0 "The Swiss dishonor us with their unwillingness to recognise our claims on lands they currently occupy. Many Italians clamor in Lugano, wanting to reunify with us. A plebiscite shall be held to determine their future, and we will do our best to make this dream of thousands come true."
ITA_Claim_Tunisia:0 "Protect East African Italians"
ITA_Claim_Tunisia_desc:0 "Many Italians still live in Eritrea and other nearby areas, having originally settled when we had controlled colonies in the area. Now, we have reason to believe that the Ethiopian government are abusing the rights of these Italians, therefore it is only natural that we intervene for their sake, and possibly reclaim more of our past legacy."
ITA_Claim_Malta:0 "Our Ties in Malta"
ITA_Claim_Malta_desc:0 "While Malta may be a small island, that does not make it any less Italian than it already is. Its historical ties with Sicily are more than enough proof that it is indeed a part of our nation like any other. Not only that, but it is also a fairly strategic position for naval operations. If we take the island back, it will be one less threat to face against."
ITA_Claim_Libya:0 "Take Back Libya"
ITA_Claim_Libya_desc:0 "When we defeated the Ottoman Empire in 1912, Libya was the greatest of all the spoils of that war, and a triumph that placed our kingdom in leagues with the likes of France and Britain. Now with the Ottomans exposed and at their weakest, we must strike once again, and take back Libya!"
ITA_Successful_Irredentist:0 "Greater Italia Reclaimed!"
ITA_Successful_Irredentist_desc:0 "Finally, we have triumphed. Against all the odds that were stacked against us, we have not only managed to reunite the peninsula, but also our colonies and lost territories under one flag and nation. Our age of humiliation is at an end, and now we stand tall as one of the great powers of the world. But we will not stop there - soon, the world shall know the might of Italy as it once had during the age of Rome! Onwards, to victory!"
ITA_Neutrality:0 "A New Direction"
ITA_Neutrality_desc:0 "With Italy now beginning to once again stand on her own two feet for the first time since the end of the War, we stand at a cross roads. With it being obvious that war between Germany and the French will flare up once again, many have begun calling for us to join arms with a global faction, and stand with them in their crusade against Radicalism. However, while the Syndies may have brought division to Italy, we have no bone to pick with them. Why fight a war that we have no part in? Instead, let us cast aside any alliances, and simply defend our borders. Blessed are the Peacemakers after all, and we have no need to cause war."
ITA_Interventionism:0 "Italy and Her Allies"
ITA_Interventionism_desc:0 "With the second Risorgimento completed, we have now found our footing on the world stage once more - now is the time for us to reclaim our greater legacy as Italians!"
ITA_Join_Germany:0 "Alliance with the Kaiser"
ITA_Join_Germany_desc:0 "It is only obvious that we should stand besides the Kaiser. If we are to secure our homeland, we must have a strong ally, and who better than the German Empire? If we send an envoy to Berlin to request entrance into the Reichspakt they will be sure to accept, especially considering our border with the Commune of France. Together, our nations will stand second to none!"
ITA_Join_Austria:0 "A Visit to Vienna"
ITA_Join_Austria_desc:0 "Though our history with the Austrians has been tense to say the least, we cannot deny that they are better as allies than enemies. After all, a repeat of the humiliation brought to us during the Weltkrieg certainly means doom for our nation. Their close proximity and considerable military force ensures that we can rely on their support in these turbulent times."
ITA_Join_Canada:0 "Stand with the Entente Once More"
ITA_Join_Canada_desc:0 "The Entente would be able to help us defend ourselves with their mighty navy. They can use an ally, and so can we.""When Italy had joined the Entente in 1915, we were bolstered by the idea of gaining new territories and exerting our influence; it was tragic to see how much we had underestimated the Austrians, with our incompetent military and generals bringing the nation to ruin had it not been for sheer luck. Now we have learnt from our past, and have grown stronger as a result. With the French exiles to our south, and the Canadians with their impressive navy, we can honour the treaty of London and rejoin the Entente, freeing us from the ires of the Kaiserreich or the Habsburgs."
ITA_Our_Own_Faction:0 "An Italian Sphere!"
ITA_Our_Own_Faction_desc:0 "We don't need the support of any other nation but our own - we owe no favors to the Germans, Austrians, Canadians or any other. It was by our own hands that we reunited Italy, and so it must be our hands that will bring Italy into the future, an Italian future created by Italian Strength! Viva Italia!"
ITA_Join_Russia:0 "Join Arms with the Rus"
ITA_Join_Russia_desc:0 "Though many would regard the Russians as a relatively unorthodox choice for an alliance, they are a natural enemy of the Germans and Austrians alike. As a rising power much like them, this could present a golden opportunity for our shared might to sweep across Europe, molding the future in our image without the Syndicalist, the Hun or the weak husks of old powers."
ITA_Isolationism:0 "Put the Defense of Italy First!"
ITA_Isolationism_desc:0 "Already we had seen our beloved Italia torn apart once by our enemies and rebels, and it was no small feat to bring it back together. To overstep our bounds and misjudge our ambitions as we did during the first Weltkrieg will lead to disaster. We must look to protect our nation and its current borders."
ITA_Northern_Frontier:0 "Secure the Northern Frontier"
ITA_Northern_Frontier_desc:0 "One of the main reasons behind our humiliation at the hands of the Austrians was our lack of properly fortified defences. Never again shall we expose our lands so easily - reinforcing our borders will certainly keep them at bay."
ITA_Western_Frontier:0 "Prepare Against the Communards"
ITA_Western_Frontier_desc:0 "With the Commune of France seeking to reclaim their lost lands, many in our government have grown concerned. If they can so easily demand land from the Swiss, then what stops them from encroaching on our territories? As a measure of national security, we will construct military fortifications around Piedmont, as a warning to the Syndicalists and a message for the Italian people - we will not back down!"
ITA_Nationalization:0 "New Nationalist Thought"
ITA_Nationalization_desc:0 "Many people, revanchists and nationalists mostly, have recently spoken out against our new foreign policies, viewing it as a betrayal of our brothers entrapped by foreign boots. It is vital that we educate them that this is the only solution for a better Italy, and gain their support before it is too late."
ITA_Guard_the_Coasts:0 "Guard the Coasts"
ITA_Guard_the_Coasts_desc:0 "Our unique geography brings along with it many boons, but also some issues. Much of our coastlines are unprotected and leaves us exposed to naval invasions. To counter this, we should invest in fortifications across our most vulnerable coasts."
ITA_Papal_Conclave:0 "Call Papal Conclave"
ITA_Papal_Conclave_desc:0 "With the death of Pius XI, a conclave will need to be called by the cardinals to select a replacement - a Pope who will determine our path for the years to come."
ITA_Elia_dalla_Costa:0 "Pope Stephen X"
ITA_Elia_dalla_Costa_desc:0 "Elia dalla Costa is a man most favoured by the people due to his charitable nature. However, he is not a man overly interested in politics, and his election will most likely result in the papacy giving way to the rule of either the aristocracy or the people."
ITA_Soup_Kitchens:0 "Feed the Poor"
ITA_Soup_Kitchens_desc:0 "The poor of our country need to be fed, just as our Lord commands us to do. The new system of charity will make use of popular donations, allowing the government to invest its resources elsewhere."
ITA_Rise_Masses:0 "Rise of the Masses"
ITA_Rise_Masses_desc:0 "The thing about the poor is that they exist in multitudes. Fed, clothed, and provided the fire of inspiration which only God can provide, they can be marshalled to support the will of the Pope with a fervor unmatched by any mercenary."
ITA_Approach_Nobility:0 "Approach the Aristocracy"
ITA_Approach_Nobility_desc:0 "The Italian aristocracy still holds a great deal of power in the nation, and they are all too nervous of losing it entirely with the wave of democracy and syndicalism which has swept the continent. They must be reassured they have a place in the order to come."
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy:0 "Sideline the Aristocracy"
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy_desc:0 "The Italian aristocracy holds far too much power and wealth, and they will go to great lengths to protect it - even so far as to overthrow the pope, if they feel he is threatening their stranglehold on the people. That must end."
ITA_Centralise2:0 "Centralize the State"
ITA_Centralise2_desc:0 "The resistance of nobles to give way for further centralisation weakens us greatly. It is time to strengthen the position of our government, uniting the people against the dangers of our time."
ITA_Modern_Education_System:0 "Expand the Universities"
ITA_Modern_Education_System_desc:0 "We have so far neglected the need of modern and highly efficient education system and the necessity of keeping the scientists well supported. Our new progressive reform will improve our situation in this area greatly."
ITA_Reestablish_Monarchy:0 "Reestablish Monarchy"
ITA_Reestablish_Monarchy_desc:0 "As was to be expected, Pope Stephen X intends to step down as the head of state, allowing him to care for the poor more directly. Let us reestablish the Kingdom of Italy and choose a man worthy of being called King. Now, the Pope can step aside as Italy's head of state and instead rule the City of Rome while the rest of Italy is ruled by a King."
ITA_Establish_Democracy:0 "Establish Democracy"
ITA_Establish_Democracy_desc:0 "As was to be expected, Pope Stephen X intends to step down as the head of state, allowing him to care for the poor more directly. His legacy will be extending the rule of Italy to its people."
ITA_Achille_Lienart:0 "Pope John XXIII"
ITA_Achille_Lienart_desc:0 "A socialist at heart, Achille Lienart would do his utmost to prevent another Great War by decreasing the political tension. Electing him could even mean limited friendship with the syndicalists, no matter how unpopular such a move would be among Italian nationalists."
ITA_Worker_Rights_Reform:0 "Social Welfare Program"
ITA_Worker_Rights_Reform_desc:0 "There needs to be no revolution to reach the necessary social changes. As times change, so shall our law."
ITA_Secular_Trade_Unions:0 "Christian Trade Unions"
ITA_Secular_Trade_Unions_desc:0 "The trade unions are the bedrocks of the modern social state. Therefore they provide the perfect opportunity to further promote the word of Jesus!"
ITA_Industrialise_the_Peninsula:0 "Industrialise the Peninsula"
ITA_Industrialise_the_Peninsula_desc:0 "With the unions empowered, we must mobilise the workers of Italy to expand our industry and make it the heart of our growing state."
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy_II:0 "Sideline the Aristocracy"
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy_II_desc:0 "The Italian aristocracy holds far too much power and wealth, and they will go to great lengths to protect it - even so far as to overthrow the pope, if they feel he is threatening their stranglehold on the people. That must end."
ITA_Reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation"
ITA_Reconciliation_desc:0 "Italy does not need to be completely divided by ideology. While it will take many difficult talks to unite Italy once again, for the moment we can at least agree to mutually recognise our governments and embark upon an exchange of ideas."
ITA_Establish_Democracy_II:0 "Power to the People"
ITA_Establish_Democracy_II_desc:0 "The last step in social reform is recognising that God's place is to guide, not to rule. True power belongs in the people, and a socialist state must be erected to look after their welfare. Now, the Pope can step aside as Italy's head of state and instead rule the City of Rome while the rest of Italy is under a Republic."
ITA_Theodor_Innitzer:0 "Pope Julius IV"
ITA_Theodor_Innitzer_desc:0 "Theodor Innitzer is a man described by many as leaning to far right ideology. He warns against the evils of radical socialism, and declares he is willing to take up arms to defend Christendom by any means necessary."
ITA_Extended_Armament:0 "Extend Armament Production"
ITA_Extended_Armament_desc:0 "War in our time may be no shorter than the Great war. A stable supply of equipment for our troops will be invaluable."
ITA_Arm_the_Population:0 "Arm the People"
ITA_Arm_the_Population_desc:0 "Should the syndicalists come, it will be up to each and every Italian to guard their homes and take the fight to the enemy."
ITA_Promote_Corporativism_II:0 "Promote Corporativism"
ITA_Promote_Corporativism_II_desc:0 "The new Catholic way of governance will ensure every man of every occupation will be represented accordingly, leading to a much more stable government."
ITA_Centralise4:0 "Centralise the State"
ITA_Centralise4_desc:0 "The resistance of nobles to give way for further centralisation weakens us greatly. It is time to strengthen the position of our government, uniting the people against the dangers of our time."
ITA_Papal_Knights:0 "The Papal Knights"
ITA_Papal_Knights_desc:0 "The security of our borders is one matter, but we must also look to the enemies within. A new order of knights must be created to combat chaos in the name of God. They will watch the people closely indeed."
ITA_Papal_Authority:0 "Papal Authority"
ITA_Papal_Authority_desc:0 "The increasing secularisation of society means a lessening of the pope´s influence. However, there are ways by which we can increase his influence inside our own borders."
ITA_contra_principia:0 "Crusade Against Syndicalism"
ITA_contra_principia_desc:0 "While we would prefer peace, against the great evil of syndicalism there can be no compromise. We have put off the inevitable for far too long. Our military is ready and prepared to defend the catholic faith and liberate the land from the godless syndicalists that have desecrated the north."
ITA_Anti_Syndicalist_Encyclical:0 "Condemn Syndicalism"
ITA_Anti_Syndicalist_Encyclical_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a scourge of all things holy. It is unacceptable to let Catholics join syndicalists movements. The pope must publish an encyclical to make this clear."
ITA_Southern_Border:0 "Strengthen the Border"
ITA_Southern_Border_desc:0 "If an invasion comes, it will be by the evil syndicalists to the south. We must strengthen our border, fortify it to withstand the onslaught."
ITA_Eugenio_Pacelli:0 "Pope Pius XII"
ITA_Eugenio_Pacelli_desc:0 "Eugenio Pacelli is a man of peace and stability. His rule is perhaps sure to strengthen our country in many ways, making sure a mighty Italy walks the true path of God."
ITA_Promote_Traditional_Values:0 "Promote Traditional Values"
ITA_Promote_Traditional_Values_desc:0 "A christian population is a loyal one. Focusing our propaganda on this fact may prove fruitful."
ITA_Art_Funding:0 "The Beauty of God"
ITA_Art_Funding_desc:0 "Let the government patronise some of the most promising artists and architects. They will not forget it, and neither will the Italian people."
ITA_Encyclical_Corruption:0 "Encyclical Against Corruption"
ITA_Encyclical_Corruption_desc:0 "Pope Pius XII intends to issue a new encyclical, one aimed at corruption - both in the soul and within the government. It offers guidance to a nation struggling with finding its path."
ITA_Safe_Haven:0 "Haven for the Faithful"
ITA_Safe_Haven_desc:0 "With the radical and totalitarian movements gaining power throughout the world, great scientists are at risk of persecution. Let's make sure Italy is the place they can and will emigrate into."
ITA_Defenders_Faith:0 "Defenders of the Faith"
ITA_Defenders_Faith_desc:0 "The time has come for Italy to take on its role as the defender of God and virtue, and for the people to rise up to its service."
ITA_Centralise1:0 "Centralise the State"

ITA_savoyard_throne_desc:0 "Finally, the legitimate Monarchs of All Italy have returned to their place on the throne. Now they seek to reclaim the legacy that has so long been kept from them by Socialists and Republicans. "
ITA_imperial_ambitions:0 "Imperial Ambitions"
ITA_imperial_ambitions_desc:0 "Italy may have it’s rightful King restored, but many areas of rightful Italian control have still weaseled away. We must retake these areas, for the King!"
ITA_monarchism:0 "Rally Around the King"
ITA_monarchism_desc:0 "The King is not just a monarch, he is a rallying figure for the people of Italy. He is a symbol for all of us and should be treated as such by all in our lands. "
ITA_honor_veterans:0 "Remember our Veterans"
ITA_honor_veterans_desc:0 "Our veterans gave much for our nation, limbs, sanity and sometimes their lives. It is appropriate to honour them and all of their sacrifices. After all, if it was not for our brave veterans would we even have a nation in the first place?"
ITA_new_land_reform:0 "Monarchist Land Reform"
ITA_new_land_reform_desc:0 "Land reform was tried under previous governments to little avail. However, they were all clearly doing it wrong, under the Monarchist system this land reform will succeed and help bring the Italian Peninsula into the future. "
ITA_Heir_to_Augustus:0 "Honor our Legacy"
ITA_Heir_to_Augustus_desc:0 "We are the true heirs to Augustus, the successors to Rome and the continuers of her great legacy. It is time we recognized that, and work to reclaim the legacy that Rome laid out. "

## Habsburg Path ##
ITA_habsburg_throne:0 "A Habsburg on the Throne"

ITA_church_support:0 "Support of the Church"
ITA_church_support_desc:0 "Few in our new kingdom support the king, if we are to stabilize the country. We must seek the support of the Catholic Church, and in particular, the Pope."
ITA_army_professionalism:0 "A Professionalized Army"
ITA_army_professionalism_desc:0 "Our Army is already the strongest in the Mediterranean, but with help from some Austrian advisors, and the king's personal experience in the Austrian military, we could make our army comparable to the likes of Russia or Germany."
ITA_crack_down_dissenters:0 "End the Dissenters"
ITA_crack_down_dissenters_desc:0 "There are many in the Kingdom that would attempt to overthrow the king, we must use our great military strength to crush these rebels before they become too powerful."

## Bourbon Path ##
ITA_borbon_throne:0 "A Bourbon on the Throne"
ITA_borbon_throne_desc:0 "Now that the Pope has stepped aside, and Ferdinand Pius di Borbone has been proclaimed as King, and will restore the Bourbon Dynasty to prominence in Italy. Despite his unpopularity, the Bourbons are intent on keeping and restoring the legacy of the House of Bourbon. "
ITA_decentralized_governance:0 "A Decentralised Government"

### Events ###
italy.1.t:0 "Father Charles Coughlin"
italy.1.d:0 "Three years from today, Father Charles Coughlin started doing weekly a radio broadcast in America and more than 50 million people turn on their radios and listen. He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'foremented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
italy.1.a:0 "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"
italy.1.b:0 "It would be best if we did not interfere"

italy.2.t:0 "Gabriele d'Annunzio Dies"
italy.2.d:0 "Gabriele d'Annunzio died today of a stroke. Poet, journalist, novelist and above all a staunch Italian nationalist. Some suspected him of syndicalist views earlier in his life, but his unabated support to the Risorgimento cleared him of these wild accusations. His supporters used his funeral as an occasion to call for the Risorgimento of Italy."
italy.2.a:0 "He will be missed"

italy.3.t:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno"
italy.3.d:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope therefore demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporativism is just beginning."

Joseph is not only the Grand Duke of Tuscany and an Archduke of Austria, he is also a valuable military leader. However, certain staunch monarchists have brought forth a proposal to bring back our exiled king, Victor Emmanuel III; though due to his unpopularity, another candidate may be chosen. More unorthodox candidates such as the heir to the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, Ferdinando III, and Prince Louis-Napoléon have been considered."

italy.23.d:0 "Our control over [new_italian_core.GetName] has finally been consolidated! It is now considered an integral part of [Root.GetNameDef]."
italy.23.a:0 "Long live [Root.GetNameDef]!"

italy.24.t:0 "The Italians Bark Back"
italy.24.d:0 "Though our counteroffer was generous while also necessarily taking into account the sheer fragility of the current global order, the ruling Italian regime has denied our offer of aid and guarantees to their maintained national sovereignty. Their government has decided to look elsewhere on the diplomatic stage for allies and compatriots, while our alliance will soldier ever onwards, with or without the ever-squabbling Italians."
italy.24.a:0 "So be it. We can find better allies and better wine elsewhere!"

italy.25.t:0 "A New Direction for Italy’s Future"
italy.25.d:0 "With our last overtures and talks of cooperation failing miserably, our diplomatic delegation, instead of returning to Rome, has instead been instructed to immediately make preparations for a trip to another one of the great alliances’ capitals to quickly and urgently find a new alliance for our newly stabilized and unified pan-Italian regime to seek shelter within. Though we have stabilized, the rest of the World has long been on a collision course with absolute disaster, and we must be ready for when this chaos reaches our own borders. So, where shall we send our delegation?"
italy.25.a:0 "Petition the Kaiser in Vienna."
italy.25.b:0 "We shall look to the Kaiser in Berlin instead."
italy.25.c:0 "Reach out to our old allies of the Weltkrieg."
italy.25.e:0 "Italy shall stand alone!"
italy.25.f:0 "The Russians will appreciate our strength properly."

italy.26.t:0 "King [From.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
italy.26.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties with our nation."
italy.26.a:0 "What a lovely visit!"
italy.26.b:0 "We will ensure Italy's continued independence"
italy.26.c:0 "We will return Venetia if they agree to join our alliance."

italy.27.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Returns from Austria"
italy.27.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries."
italy.27.a:0 "That's it? Nothing else?"

italy.28.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Returns from Austria"
italy.28.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries. He returns to Italy with assurances from Austria that they will fight to guarantee our future independence."
italy.28.a:0 "That's something, I suppose"

italy.29.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Returns from Austria"
italy.29.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries. He returns to Italy having won the return of lands in Venetia and assurances of support from Austria. In return for these lands, the Austrian government has requested that we formally join their alliance. This request has caused a rift within the government, with some believing that we should not sacrifice our independence by diplomatically tying ourselves to Austria. Some ardent nationalists have also claimed that Venetia is not enough and Istria, Tyrol, and the Dalmatian coast all belongs to Italy. With these considerations in mind, what should we do?"
italy.29.a:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has done well, agree to their demands!"
italy.29.b:0 "We will not tie ourselves to their dying Empire!"

italy.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits [Root.GetName]!"
italy.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depth, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached [Root.GetName]. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Italian lira is losing value, and industrial exports are shrinking..."
italy.30.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."

italy.31.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes"
italy.31.d:0 "The order has been given to clear the Pontine Marshes and thus open the once-useless land for farming or industry. The plan will require the employment of thousands of Italians and take many months to get the bulk of it done, but the outcome may be worth it."
italy.31.a:0 "So long as it keeps them working, I'm happy"

italy.32.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes are Cleared"
italy.32.d:0 "The areas formerly known as the Pontine Marshes are now cleared, with factories and farms springing up throughout the area. More importantly is the hope this brings to the nation, that the malaise hanging over [Root.GetName] by the effects of Black Monday might one day actually come to an end."
italy.32.a:0 "A monumental achievement!"

italy.33.t:0 "Worsening Economic Conditions"
italy.33.d:0 "The economic fallout from Black Monday is getting worse day by day, as we underestimated its initial effects and took limited action to counter them. There are some laissez faire economists who argue that nothing should be done and that the market will recover itself eventually. There are others among the Church who advocate a continuation of a campaign started by Pius XI for the creation of Catholic corporations: they would be structured, organised and controlled with our support, and lead to the creation of many new independent unions that support workers. Some believe that will give rise to more syndicalist sentiment, however."
italy.33.a:0 "Support and organise the Catholic Corporations"
italy.33.b:0 "Put more people to work, no matter the cost"
italy.33.c:0 "Allow the creation of non-catholic unions"
italy.33.e:0 "Do nothing, let the market recover itself"

italy.34.t:0 "The Economy Recovers"
italy.34.d:0 "The bad effects of Black Monday have finally disappeared: we can look at the future with hope. The economy is finally recovered!"
italy.34.a:0 "The Catholic Corporations saved the country!"
italy.34.b:0 "The market recovered on its own!"
italy.34.c:0 "The trade unions saved the country!"
italy.34.e:0 "The work programs seem to have done the trick!"

italy.35.t:0 "Stage 1"
italy.35.d:0 "The first part of the National development program consists of government making use of the most modern, even experimental techniques for the construction. This will help us in the future."
italy.35.a:0 "Let the work begin!"

italy.36.t:0 "Stage 2"
italy.36.d:0 "The second part of the National development program includes construction of the so called 'Culture houses'. They will function as a way to boost the national pride of our people. The construction itself is bound to make the people content with the government."
italy.36.a:0 "Let´s continue!"

italy.37.t:0 "Stage 3"
italy.37.d:0 "The third part of the National development program has technically been going on since the programs initiation, but now that the rest of the work is done, the progress can accelerate. This part consists of various efforts of land clearance, such as the clearance of Pontine marshes. This will enable us to improve our long-term industrial potential."
italy.37.a:0 "Yes, do it!"

italy.38.t:0 "National Construction Program Finished"
italy.38.d:0 "The program has been a great success! Not only the population likes the results, but, perhaps even more importantly, the government does. Now, it is time to put our effort elsewhere."
italy.38.a:0 "Great job, guys!"

italy.41.t:0 "The Death of Pius XI"
italy.41.d:0 "With the passing of the Pope, what action should we take? Mourn the Pope's death or attempt to install the loyal Duke Giuseppe di Toscana on the throne? Doing so would make [From.GetName] a puppet of Austria, though it would greatly displease the many Catholics of our nation."
italy.41.a:0 "Send our Condolences to Rome"
italy.41.b:0 "Press the claims of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana"

italy.42.t:0 "Austria Interferes!"
italy.42.d:0 "[From.GetName] is insisting on the installation of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana as King of Italy, interfering with the Papal Election."
italy.42.a:0 "An emergency conclave elects Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"
italy.42.b:0 "Elect Giuseppe, we are an Austrian dominion once again"
italy.42.c:0 "Innitzer will crown Giuseppe, but we shall remain independent"

italy.43.t:0 "The Papacy Under Innitzer Resists!"
italy.43.d:0 "The Papacy has defied the prospect of our noble rule, and Cardinal Innitzer has convened an emergency conclave to have himself declared Pope Julius IV. What course of action shall we take now?"
italy.43.a:0 "If they won't give their independence, we shall take it! To war!"
italy.43.b:0 "Italy is not worth the trouble, back down"
italy.43.c:0 "Beg the Papacy for forgiveness!"

italy.44.t:0 "Austria Backs Down"
italy.44.d:0 "Though we've watched the border for signs of Austrian aggression, there appears to be none. [From.GetLeader] has apparently backed away from his threat."
italy.44.a:0 "Did they think they could bully us so easily?"

italy.45.t:0 "Austria Apologizes"
italy.45.d:0 "Though we were ready for an invasion, what has occurred is quite the opposite. An envoy from [From.GetNameDef] has expressed apologies from [From.GetLeader] to His Holiness for any offence, and states he will fight to protect our independence in the years to come. \nThis is truly a victory for the Italian nation"
italy.45.a:0 "Well that was unexpected..."

italy.46.t:0 "Italy Submits!"
italy.46.d:0 "Italy caved in to the Austrian Empire as expected, and now Duke Giuseppe sits on the Italian throne as Giuseppe I, a puppet under our benevolent rule."
italy.46.a:0 "Hurrah!"
italy.46.b:0 "Great news, in exchange we will return Venetia!"

italy.47.t:0 "Innitzer Proclaims Giuseppe as King!"
italy.47.d:0 "Duke Giuseppe has been proclaimed king, as per our demand, but Cardinal Innitzer has engineered a means to retain control over the government. Thus Italy will not be under our control, regardless of the king's true wishes."
italy.47.a:0 "We endorse this result whole-heartedly!"
italy.47.b:0 "Very well, but we shall keep our distance"
italy.47.c:0 "Demand Innitzer step down immediately!"

italy.48.t:0 "Austria Supports Italian Kingdom"
italy.48.d:0 "As Duke Giuseppe ascends to the Italian throne, Austria has sent word that they support our kingdom whole-heartedly and have offered to protect our future independence."
italy.48.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

italy.49.t:0 "Giuseppe Takes the Throne"
italy.49.d:0 "While our government worried that Austria's true plan was to take control of Italy through King Giuseppe, they have remained silent on the matter of our continued independence. [From.GetLeader] declined to attend the king'd coronation, and there has been no further contact."
italy.49.a:0 "No news is good news, right?"

italy.50.t:0 "Austria Wants Innitzer Gone!"
italy.50.d:0 "While Austria is apparently pleased with the crowning of Josef, they have shown their true colours by demanding Innitzer step down from the Papacy and for Cardinal Elia Dalla Costa to replace him!"
italy.50.a:0 "Refuse and overthrow the false king!"
italy.50.b:0 "As our new overlords wish..."

italy.55.t:0 "The Papal Conclave"
italy.55.d:0 "The Holy See has finally came together to deliberate the election of a new Pope following Pius XI's death. In the end they choose to..."
italy.55.a:0 "...elect the pious and popular Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli as Pius XII"
italy.55.b:0 "...elect the charitable Elia Cardinal dalla Costa as Stephen X"
italy.55.c:0 "...elect the socialist cardinal, Achille Liènart, as John XXIII"
italy.55.e:0 "...elect the hardliner Theodor Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"

italy.56.t:0 "Condemn Pope [From.GetLeader]?"
italy.56.d:0 "A conclave has elected Pope [From.GetLeader] as the head of the Catholic Church, and thus the ruler of northern Italy. We should condemn him as a potential danger to our nation, but the majority of our people are Catholic and might be upset. Even so, should we stand by and watch our own brethren be brainwashed into such unjust rule?"
italy.56.a:0 "Religion is - always had been - the enemy of the Proletariat"
italy.56.b:0 "No, Pope [From.GetLeader] is a socialist and friend of the Republic"
italy.56.c:0 "Maybe we can come to terms with this new Pope?"

italy.57.t:0 "The Commune Condemns the Pope"
italy.57.d:0 "Reacting to the recent ascension of Pope [Root.GetLeader], the Syndicalist Italian Commune in the south has condemned the Holy Father and the Church in a public speech. We must react to this insult."
italy.57.a:0 "Issue an encyclical against syndicalism"
italy.57.b:0 "Love thy enemies"

italy.58.t:0 "Papal Encyclical Against Syndicalism"
italy.58.d:0 "Pope [From.GetLeader] has issued an outrageous encyclical condemning Syndicalism, and as a result our mainly Catholic population is growing increasingly restless..."
italy.58.a:0 "Confiscate church property!"
italy.58.b:0 "Let this go no further"

italy.59.t:0 "The Catholic Exodus"
italy.59.d:0 "Ever since our government began its crackdown on Catholics, many people have begun to emigrate north into [ITA.GetNameDef]. The main artery for this so-called 'exodus' is, apparently, the small border port of Anzio."
italy.59.a:0 "Seal off the border and occupy Anzio"
italy.59.b:0 "Less drastic measures will have to be employed"

italy.60.t:0 "The Exodus"
italy.60.d:0 "Ever since the Catholic Church issued its encyclical against Syndicalism, thousands of our faithful brothers in the south have fled north to liberty."
italy.60.a:0 "Welcome!"

italy.61.t:0 "The Battle of Anzio"
italy.61.d:0 "In responce to the mass flight of Catholic faithful north, the syndicalists of [From.GetNameDef] sealed the border. In the early morning hours of the following day, [From.GetAdjective] troops attacked Anzio - a main artery of the exodus and are quickly overrunning the city. We can either let this happen or meet force with force!"
italy.61.a:0 "We have lost this battle"
italy.61.b:0 "Deus vult!"

italy.62.t:0 "The Battle of Anzio"
italy.62.d:0 "Our troops have successfully occupied Anzio, while our losses were very light. [From.GetNameDef] is, it seems, too afraid of our power to oppose us in any meaningful way."
italy.62.a:0 "Excellent"

italy.63.t:0 "Syndicalist Agitation"
italy.63.d:0 "While support in [ITA.GetNameDef] for the syndicalist cause is minimal, there have been growing rallies in the southern part of the country claiming that [SRI.GetNameDef] has been unfairly demonized by the papacy, and that Italian workers will only see improvement under a syndicalist government. The rallies have been tied to an increasing number of outbreaks of violence, and investigators are convinced the southern government is behind it all. It seems we are left with no choice but to face these rebels head-on."
italy.63.a:0 "We shall do so swiftly"

italy.64.t:0 "Syndicalist Bombing!"
italy.64.d:0 "The socialist rebels have targeted a factory in [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."
italy.64.a:0 "We will get them sooner or later..."

italy.65.t:0 "Syndicalist Bombing!"
italy.65.d:0 "The socialist rebels have targeted an arms factory in [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."

italy.66.t:0 "Syndicalists Attack Infrastructure!"
italy.66.d:0 "The socialist rebels have set off a series of bombs in the [attack_state.GetName] region, causing considerable damage to the roads system and traffic snarls for miles. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."
italy.67.t:0 "Ringleaders Apprehended!"

italy.67.d:0 "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation were apprehended by Italian investigators. This is a serious blow to the rebels, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
italy.67.d.last:0 "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation were apprehended by Italian investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [ITA.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other socialists get similar ideas in the future."
italy.67.a:0 "The sooner, the better!"
italy.67.b:0 "Finally!"

italy.68.t:0 "Syndicalist Agitation in the North"
italy.68.d:0 "It appears our efforts to establish greater syndicalist support in [ITA.GetNameDef] have met with success - there have been numerous socialist rallies in the southern part of their nation, which have grown to the point where there is now violent support to overthrow the papacy. We shall see how long this impedes their progress."
italy.68.a:0 "Our support for the rebels will certainly help"

italy.69.t:0 "Last Syndicalists Arrested"
italy.69.d:0 "It appears the last of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation in [ITA.GetNameDef] have finally been arrested by the Italian government. The rebels did some damage, however, and we shall have to be content with the demonstration they made."
italy.69.a:0 "Now we must finish the job"

italy.70.t:0 "The Italians in Switzerland"
italy.70.d:0 "The state of Ticino is home to a large Italian population, which has warmly received the news of [From.GetNameDef]'s irredentist claims on Italian lands. Today, the [From.GetAdjective] government has taken a more aggressive stance regarding Ticino and officially requested that we organise a referendum on whether its population wishes to remain a part of [Root.GetNameDef] or join [From.GetNameDef]."
italy.70.a:0 "They must be joking, right?"
italy.70.b:0 "Accept their proposal, call up a referendum on the matter"

italy.71.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
italy.71.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has declined our proposal for a fair and democratic referendum on Italian-inhabited Ticino. What should we do now? Should we forget the matter or threaten them with war?"
italy.71.a:0 "Forget about this matter, just present our territorial claims instead"
italy.71.b:0 "Mobilise our divisions on the border and threaten them with war"

italy.72.t:0 "An Italian Ultimatum"
italy.72.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to abide by our decision to not conduct a referendum in Ticino. Not only that, but they have mobilised their divisions on the border areas. According to our intelligence reports, their troops are ready cross into our territory in just a few hours, unless we bow to their demands and allow the plebiscite to proceed..."
italy.72.a:0 "We must comply to their demands, the referendum must occur"
italy.72.b:0 "We are ready to defend our country"

italy.73.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses our Ultimatum"
italy.73.d:0 "The stubborn [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to comply with our demands. With our troops mobilised on their border, this is the perfect moment to move into the disputed territories and seize them. International condemnation of our acts is a sure side-effect of this, however."
italy.73.a:0 "Cancel all plans and demobilise our troops"
italy.73.b:0 "Cross the border and seize the disputed territories"

italy.74.t:0 "Italian Troops have Entered Ticino"
italy.74.d:0 "The murderous [From.GetAdjective] army has invaded [Root.GetAdjective] territory in order to seize the disputed state of Ticino! They expect that we simply lay down our arms and retreat north, but our forces are fully capable of defending the land and even moving into [From.GetAdjective] territory itself!"
italy.74.a:0 "Lay down our arms and surrender Ticino"
italy.74.b:0 "Order our troops to resist the invasion"

italy.75.t:0 "Ticino is Ours"
italy.75.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has complied with our wishes and surrendered the disputed province to us."
italy.75.a:0 "Great!"

italy.76.t:0 "Crisis in Switzerland"
italy.76.d:0 "[aggressor.GetNameDef], in a clear violation of Swiss neutrality, has invaded the Swiss province of Ticino under the claim that Switzerland refuses to allow a referendum of the Italians living there regarding whether they wish to rejoin their homeland. This is a clear breach of international law and, as a prime power in Europe, we have the duty to warn [aggressor.GetNameDef] they must stop this madness or face the consequences."
italy.76.a:0 "This is not of our concern"
italy.76.b:0 "Guarantee Switzerland's borders"

italy.77.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Ultimatum"
italy.77.d:0 "Upon hearing news of our ongoing intervention in Switzerland, [From.GetNameDef] has warned us to halt the offensive, pull back to our borders and call an end to hostilities, unless we want to face [From.GetAdjective] arms."

italy.77.b:0 "We will not respond to their threats"

italy.78.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] and Italian troops have Exchanged Fire"
italy.78.d:0 "Italian and [From.GetAdjective] forces have exchanged fire inside the territory of Ticino, with some artillery fire also hitting Italian lands.

italy.79.t:0 "A Referendum is Called"
italy.79.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has complied with our demands and an emergency referendum has been called in Ticino. It will occur in two weeks."
italy.79.a:0 "We will watch this closely"

italy.80.t:0 "The Ticino Referendum"
italy.80.d:0 "As agreed, a referendum to decide the fate of Ticino has been called, and its inhabitants will decide if they wish to stay a part of [Root.GetNameDef] or join [From.GetNameDef]."
italy.80.a:0 "It will be a close vote..."

italy.81.t:0 "Ticino Referendum - Italian Defeat"
italy.81.d:0 "As agreed, a referendum to decide the fate of Ticino was called, and its inhabitants voted to remain a part of [From.GetNameDef]. Nonetheless, some members of our cabinet still favour a military solution to the situation and propose an invasion of the disputed territory."

italy.81.b:0 "Cross the border and seize Ticino"

italy.82.t:0 "The Italians Control Ticino"
italy.82.d:0 "The war with the Italians is going poorly. Currently they have full control over Ticino, and we are quickly losing ground. Is the canton truly worth fighting for, and even risking complete annexation?"

italy.83.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sues for Peace"
italy.83.d:0 "The war with [From.GetNameDef] goes well, and already we have control over Ticino and are pushing further into our enemy's lands. They have quickly sent an envoy, asking for white peace and offering to surrender Ticino to us with no questions asked."
italy.83.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
italy.83.b:0 "This war won't stop until we're marching on [From.Capital.GetName]!"

italy.84.t:0 "We Are Losing the War"
italy.84.d:0 "What a disaster! We thought that a quick war would be enough to capture Ticino. Instead, they not only repealed our attacks, but made incursions into [Root.GetNameDef] itself! We must back down in order to avoid an even greater shame."
italy.84.a:0 "Send the envoys and offer white peace"
italy.84.b:0 "We can still win this!"

italy.90.d:0 "Malta is home to a sizeable Italian community, dating back to the Roman and Middle Ages, although it is, currently, controlled by us as a colony. Today, [From.GetNameDef] has come up with a proposal for buying Malta from us. Should we accept the offer? The island-fortress is a symbol of our power in the Mediterranean, so by ceding control over it we'd lose some prestige... however, we would continue to have access to its harbours and cultivate a relationship with Italy as a result."
italy.90.a:0 "Accept their offer, we don't need Malta that much anymore"

Most of our people are against the proposal, though there are benefits in developing [From.GetNameDef] as an ally, and we would retain the use of bases there."

Long known for his traditionalist and reactionary views, this seemingly spontaneous decision has already been regarded by many as the delusions of a mad man bestowed with too much power.

italy.200.t:0 "The Italian Federation in 1936"
italy.200.d:0 "After the Fall of Rome in 1921, the Kingdom of Italy was officially dissolved and king Victor Emmanuel III forced to abdicate. Once word got out that Austria would force the Peninsula to be reorganized into her old pre-unification states within a loose Federation, a coalition of both socialists and nationalists would declare the Republic of Italy in Torino. Faced with overwhelming resistance from both local militias and the Austrian occupation force, the Republic was forced to retreat to the southern half of Italy; where they were able to set up a powerbase due to the Red militias silencing every dissenter. Months later, an armistice was signed with the newly-proclaimed Socialist Republic of Italy, and now both sides have mostly stabilized. \nEver since the Federation was created, it has been under the rule of Pope Pius XI, whose popularity has kept the nation together, although his health is rapidly declining and there are many who would wish to take his role as leader of the Federation. Though with all this, one thing is certain, Italy must be united again!"
italy.200.a:0 "Forward, to a united Italy!"

italy.2000.t:0 "The Consecration of France?"
italy.2000.d:0 "In 1917, in the small Portuguese village of Fatima, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to three shepherd children over the course of five months. In these visitations, the Virgin would share with the children everything from visions of Hell, to prophecies of the future. One of these prophecies foretold the fall of the Eldest Daughter of the Church, France, to the Syndicalist menace. In the same vision, the Mother of God warned that, unless the Holy Father, in union with all bishops of the world, consecrated France to her immaculate heart, the errors of the Commune would spread throughout the world./n/nWith Pope [ROOT.getleader] declaring the evils of Syndicalism and socialism, many within the hollowed halls of the Vatican have begin wondering if the Holy Father would be willing to do this consecration, in hopes of gaining Our Lady's favor in the coming wars against Syndicalism. To this end, a group of laity, priests, bishops and even a few cardinals have formally petitioned His Holiness to fulfill Our Lady's desires, and consecrate France to her Immaculate Heart. While such a consecration would do little in a material sense, the fact (or so-called fact due to the visons in Fatima being not but private revelations) that the Mother of God herself would be on the side of those who fight against Syndicalist tyranny may just be enough to win over the Holy Father. While on the other hand, such a grand consecration would no doubt be a costly affair, and many the sheer cost alone may scare the Successor of Saint Peter away from preforming the consecration. Either way, the Holy Father is expected to make a timely response to the petition, due to the sheer amount of people who have come to him with it."   
italy.2000.a:0 "We shall fulfill Our Lady's wishes and consecrated France."
italy.2000.b:0 "France is not enough! The entire world must be consecrated!"
italy.2000.c:0 "How many zeros were on that bill? This is fair too costly!"

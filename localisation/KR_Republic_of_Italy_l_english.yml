### Leaders ###
POLITICS_IVANOE_BONOMI_DESC:0 "When the Sicilians and Sardinians withdrew from the Italian Federation in 1926 the last remaining constituent part was the Republic of Lombardy-Veneto. Ivanoe Bonomi, the Prime Minister of the Republic and acting head of the Federation dissolved that construct in 1930. Despite calls for an official declaration of a new Republic of Italy, the government decided to make yet another deal with the Austrians, agreeing to keep the Lombardy-Veneto title officially while everyone in reality refers to the state as the Italian Republic, until the full withdrawal of the Austrian Garrison under Artur Edler von Schuschnigg. Bonomi's willingness to work with the much-maligned Austria, while economically beneficial, continues to draw great internal scrutiny. Bonomi struggles to weather these increasingly virulent criticisms while cementing the republic's political institutions."

### Ideas ###
ITA_austrian_occupation_idea:0 "The Austrian 'Occupation'"
ITA_austrian_occupation_idea_desc:0 "Lombardy–Venetia was occupied by the Austrians following the collapse of the so-called 'Italian Federation' to protect their interests in their region and prevent the Socialists from gaining additional territory. Only managing to avoid full-scale rebellion due to cutting a deal with Liberal and Republican Elements, Lombardy-Venetia is among the most confusing pieces of the Austro-Hungarian puzzle, with even the Civilian Government being confused by the situation at play. The status of Lombardy–Venetia remains a hotly contested topic in both Vienna and Venice, as Governor Artur Schuschnigg has repeatedly delayed debates about the territory's status on the advice of the Foreign Ministry in Vienna. The ever complex status of Lombardy–Venetia has caused no shortage of discontent, and has had the effect of further destabilizing the already tottering Austrian Empire. The Civilian Government, while holding a great deal of responsibility on paper, has often found itself sidelined in favour of Vienna's machinations, further fueling discontent. Any event that sees to shake the Austrian sphere may also have the effect of finally forcing Austria to reckon with the fate of one of their most unruly holdings."
ITA_deal_with_the_devil_idea:0 "The Deal with the Devil"
ITA_deal_with_the_devil_idea_desc:0 "The abdication of Vittorio Emanuele III and later Italian Revolution fueled the already significant nascent Republican Movement within Italy. Of course, the later full fledged turn towards Syndicalism espoused by the Republican elements which took hold put a damper on those who opposed the Monarchy yet wished to maintain a democratic system as it stood. The later collapse of the Austrian-backed 'Italian Federation' provided a new opportunity for those Democratic Republicans, who cut a deal with the Vienna controlled Governorate of Lombardy–Venetia to help ensure stability in the land beyond the Isonzo. The Austrians would allow a Republic, nominally loyal to Vienna and led in an official capacity by an Austrian Governor to form, and in exchange the Republicans would be allowed to operate a democratic Republic in the area and help keep the area stable. This compromise, while palatable to some, has come at the noticeable distaste to both the Monarchists, who wish to give the Italian Federation concept another try, and the Nationalists, who despise the deal on account of allowing Austria to lord over Italian affairs once more."
ITA_republic_federation:0 "The Unstable Republic"
ITA_republic_federation_desc:0 "When our nation was saved by Austria in 1920, the Habsburgs forced us to give much power to our constituent states, especially Veneto, as part of the Italian Federation. However, this has been adjourned for six years, effectively disbanded, creating a confusing bureaucratic situation. The opposition also causes no end of trouble, with some calling for the Federation's restoration and some calling for an end to democracy and Austrian influence altogether. The political situation is unlikely to stabilize any time soon."
ITA_republic_unitary:0 "The New Unitary Republic"
ITA_republic_unitary_desc:0 "The power of the states has been curtailed, and all authority now rests with the central government - a government which has eliminated elections and declared itself above responsibility to the people, for the good of the entire country. While the ANI enjoys a great deal of support, there is still considerable resistance to this new government - particularly from the republicans and old monarchists in the country's former states."
ITA_federation_transition:0 "The Federation Restored"
ITA_federation_transition_desc:0 "Now that the power of the Federation Council has been restored, we face the long and difficult task of getting the people and civil service to accept as their government what they once thought of as a museum piece."

ITA_austrian_influence_desc:0 "Austria's influence is felt at every level of our nation, from its ownership over many of our companies to the loyalty owed by many of our most highly-placed politicians. Resentment against that influence is high, for even if they have protected us against the syndicalists they are still responsible for our loss in the Weltkrieg. Even so, cutting ties with Austria will prove a difficult and costly task."

ITA_REP_corporate_alliance_desc:0 "The productive forces of our proletarian nation must be brought together into a great organism, a state in which various corporations shall assemble and create an economy fit to face against the plutocrats of this world.

### Events ###
italianrepublic.1.t:0 "The History of the Republic of Italy: Defeat and Civil War"
italianrepublic.1.d:0 "With the French defeat and the collapse of the Italian war effort, the Austrians and the Kingdom of Italy signed an armistice in August 1919, in which the Austrians were allowed to garrison Lombardy and Venetia until a peace treaty was signed. Mere days after the humiliating announcement of peace, enraged nationalists proclaimed the new Republic of Italy in Milan, which maintained that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. All over Italy republicans and nationalists rose up against the kingdom, and even the abdication of King Victor Emanuel and his son wasn’t enough to stop the collapse of royal authority. After pushing the royalists out of much of Central and Northern Italy it became apparent that the rivalries between differing factions in the republic were too great to reconcile, and what started with small acts of sabotage become a full-fledged conflict between Red and White forces, grinding the offensives against the monarchists to a halt."
italianrepublic.1.a:0 "Terrible."

italianrepublic.22.t:0 "The Status of the Republic of Italy: The Federation Failure"
italianrepublic.22.d:0 "As the civil war dragged on, the tides of war turned against the Whites, and when Austria offered the republicans help in exchange for joining in a common state with the royalists in the south, the republicans had no choice but to accept, or face destruction. After a victory at the Po against the Socialists, the White and Austrian forces found themselves forced to swallow the bitter pill of prolonged cooperation. The Republic was obliged to legally join the Italian Federation under Austrian protection. They also granted significant autonomy to Veneto and much influence in the government to the Austrians and the Council of the Italian Federation. In exchange, however, the Prime Minister of the Republic was granted the title Interim Head of the Italian Federation.\n\nThis carefully balanced arrangement fell apart in 1926, however, when the Union of Britain joined the Third Internationale. The Socialists were emboldened and there was talk of war, but the Austrians made it clear that their forces would make no move to attack the socialists if the south came under attack. This threw the peninsula into chaos, and gave the Sicilians and Savoyards, long dissatisfied with the pro-Milan balance in the Council of the Italian Federation, the chance to walk out. Though the socialists never attacked, the Council now clearly served no purpose, and its ten-year term was allowed to expire in 1930 which was combined with the dissolution of the Federal entity and full power being given to the last constituent part, Republic of Lombardy-Veneto which is unofficially called the Italian Republic. While the halls of civilian power in Milan bustle with activity and ambition, the Council Chamber now stands empty."
italianrepublic.22.a:0 "Will it ever fill again?"

italianrepublic.18.t:0 "The Status of the Republic of Italy: Recovery and Risorgimento"
italianrepublic.18.d:0 "Though at considerable cost to national pride, the Austrian connection slowly improved the economic standing of the Republic, which drew strength from the German Mitteleuropa and Austrian investment. As Italy recovered from the civil war's destruction, however, many in the Republic began to rue their government's deal with the Habsburgs, and popular support for Enrico Corradini's anti-Austrian Associazione Nazionalista Italiana (Italian Nationalist Association) grew in Lombardy and Friuli. \n\nIvanoe Bonomi's center-left coalition has ruled the country since 1927, but their popularity is mainly due to the economic stability, and should that end other parties such as the Partito Liberale Italiano or the Unione Politica Popolare might gain enough support to form a government. Should matters get completely out of hand and Federation-aligned forces restore order in the north by force, even the old Council of the Italian Federation, recenetly rebranding itself to the Signoria Federale, might take power. One thing all parties have in common is a desire for a free, united Italy, however, and many are sure a second Risorgimento is coming."

italianrepublic.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting the Republic of Italy, Prime Minister Ivanoe Bonomi has decided to call for an early general election. Elections will be held in 1936 instead of 1937 as was scheduled. Hopefully, with this election, the Prime Minister will be able to shore up support for his policies to resolve the economic crisis."
italianrepublic.3.a:0 "Hopefully..."

italianrepublic.4.t:0 "Corradini's Speech"
italianrepublic.4.d:0 "Enrico Corradini of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana delivered a speech in the city of Verona today. During the speech, he blamed the government of the republic for causing the economic crisis. Moreover, he went on to describe Austria's role in keeping Italy divided and weak, and that the syndicalists were only allowed to continue to exist as a foil to the Republic. Corradini promises that it is only the ANI that is able to restore Italy to glory and destroy all her enemies."
italianrepublic.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on him"

italianrepublic.5.t:0 "The Church Comments on the Crisis"
italianrepublic.5.d:0 "A number of influential figures within the church have been rallying support for political figures during their sermons. Of particular note are the Archbishops of Milan and Venice, who have urged parishioners to follow traditional catholic values during this crisis, a none too subtle nod of support for the conservative Popolare Italiano party. However some bishops, though not as influential as those in Milan and Venice, have instead urged support for Catholic Social Teaching and the ruling Reformist Socialist party. In both cases, people are listening to the advice of the church."

italianrepublic.6.t:0 "Olivetti Supports Bonomi"
italianrepublic.6.d:0 "Adriano Olivetti, leader of the Movimento Comunità, the Liberal Socialist party in coalition with Ivanoe Bonomi, has given a speech in Milan supporting the prime minister. This has given valuable support to the besieged ruling party."

italianrepublic.7.t:0 "Protests Against Farm Auctions"
italianrepublic.7.d:0 "The current economic crisis has caused a lot of farmers to default on their loans and mortgages, and their livestock and property are normally auctioned away to the highest bidder by local authorities. The practice is deeply unpopular among Italian farmers, but its proponents claim that debts must be repaid and that the auctions are a necessary evil in a free market economy. Yesterday, the Italian People's Party proposed a bill that would ban the auctions. What is the government's position on the issue?"
italianrepublic.7.a:0 "Allow the auctions to continue"
italianrepublic.7.b:0 "Pass the bill and ban the auctions"

italianrepublic.8.t:0 "Influence in the Italian Government"
italianrepublic.8.d:0 "In 1919, we signed an armistice with the Kingdom of Italy, which allowed us to garrison Lombardy and Venetia until a treaty was signed. The Italians were little pleased with this defeat, and rose up in revolution against their Savoyard monarch. Soon, he and his son abdicated, and there was a power vacuum in Italy, as socialist rebels seemed primed to overrun the entire nation. We offered the desperate Italians the aid of our armies in stopping the socialist advance, in exchange for joining a new Italian Federation, a legitimate government we could deal with. The Savoyards, White republicans, and southern forces agreed to our terms, and our armies pushed the socialists out of Lombardy. We did concede to the republicans that a republican leader would be the interim head of the Federation, though the Federation Council would retain some power behind the scenes. However, when the socialists made moves to attack the southern states of the Federation in 1926, we were embroiled in the Illyrian crisis, and could not promise to attack the socialists in support. Outraged, Sardinia, the Bourbons in Naples, and even the Holy Father himself abandoned our Federation, leaving us with only Milan. Unfortunately, the Federation Council there was allowed to lapse in 1930, and has not been renewed since. Even worse, we recently withdrew our military from their nation due to the Black Monday crisis, leaving them far more independent than they were.\n\nNow the current liberal government under Ivanoe Bonomi has pushed forward the election in a bid for more support in the legislature. However, their victory is not a sure thing, and we have some leeway to influence the election. The three moderate parties that have a real chance at winning are the Reformist Socialists, currently in power, the People's Union, a conservative party who has enjoyed our support in the past, and the Italian Liberals, hostile to monarchy but also vehemently anti-ANI and anti-socialist. We can give our support and backing to one of the pro-Austrian political parties to ensure that the right one takes power in Milan. Some ministers, however, are concerned that overt involvement might result in further support for the far right and anti-Austrian Italian Nationalist Association."

This notion has already been denounced by right-wing members of parliament as 'siding with syndicalism', and suggest they should be de-collectivized and privatized.

Venetia has called for our help, though we must wait at least a few months before we can directly intervene without it appearing like we are interested only in conquest. If we do intervene, many within the Austrian government are suggesting that our only interest would be in restoring the old Italian Federation, this time under a Habsburg ruler. Indeed, the Italians are so fed up with this failure of democracy, they might welcome such an option with open arms."

italianrepublic.61.d:0 "With the republic now at war, Carina Massone Negrone has asked to fly for the Republic's Air Force. It is highly unusual that a lady would make such a request, and a number of ministers believe that she should be refused. However, as a personal friend, the great statesman Enrico Corradini believes that a compromise could be reached where she can lead a force of female aviators to fly non-combat missions. This would allow more men to actually fly."

The organisation is similar to a scouting group for children. The organisation has two similar structures one for boys and the other for girls with both being divided into three groups for different age brackets.

Now that threat is gone, and the question is whether should we send an ultimatum to demand that the Republic reform into a Federation, something that will be more acceptable to Vienna.

italianrepublic.151.d:0 "Black Monday has hit [AUS.GetNameDef] hard. Their markets have plunged so low that many Austrian stockholders of Austro-Italian companies have panicked and sold countless bonds to native Italians, weakening the Austrian stranglehold over our economy. Not only have we rid ourselves of foreign economic influence, the Austro-Hungarian Reichskriegsminister has recalled the divisions stationed in our territory, unable to afford the financial burden of keeping us safe from what many in Vienna foolishly believe to be an empty Socialist threat. For good or ill, [ITA.GetNameDef] is now effectively independent of Austrian domination, at least until they regain their full strength. Many Italians are worried about whether or not this will leave us exposed to attack by [SRI.GetNameDef]. A war right now would be a terrible prospect."

Already they have been directly implicated in two riots and several bombings, with posters accusing the Italian government of conspiracy and selling out to foreign interests being plastered everywhere in the capital.

The largest of these drew well over a hundred thousand in Milan, bringing the nation to a standstill as protestors threatened to start a national strike if the government does not round up the ANI ringleaders soon.

With hundreds of casualties, Corradini and his supporters were eventually dispersed. Enrico Corradini remains at large, however, and despite his failure to enact a coup there are now calls for the government to step down. Opposition parties claim the republic is in chaos and intend to force a vote of confidence in the Italian parliament as soon as possible."

italianrepublic.156.t:0 "The Vote of Confidence"
italianrepublic.156.d:0 "Today the vote of confidence will be held in the Italian parliament. At stake is the very survival of the republic - if the government falls, it will be a clear sign that the system is considered dysfunctional, and many are reluctant to turn to yet another chaotic election campaign. Indeed, members of the nobility have been gathering supporters around them and are already suggesting that an empowerment of the monarchical Federation Council might be preferable. The threat of this has pulled other officials to call for votes in support of the government, no matter what."

One is to restore the power of the Federation, where members of the nobility would take up administrative posts on the Signoria Federale, to be led either by the Habsburg Grand Duke of Tuscany, Giuseppe Ferdinando, or Duke Marcello Visconti di Modrone of Lombardy. Elections would be restricted throughout parts of the country and democracy as we know it would end. While many favor the stability that route would bring, there are others, among them Venetian nationalists, who suggest disbanding the Federation in its entirety - the states of Venetia and Lombardy would become independent entities, even though such a separation might only prove an opportunity for outside forces to pounce."

It is unknown whether any have agreed to join his cause, but rancor against the government has been increasing and many officials fear a coup could be in the offing. Taking a stand against the ANI now, however, could provoke the kind of violence which might drive the army towards supporting Corradini even if they weren't already considering it. What shall we do?"

The crowds pouring into the central square are massive, and as the Italian police and military move in it is clear that the resulting bloodshed will be horrific. Already, even before it is determined whether Corradini's coup might be successful, there are members of the opposition calling for a vote of confidence concerning the government's handling of the situation. Such calls might be moot, however, if Corradini's sheer numbers win the day..."

A skilled warrior-poet and writer, Shimoi is a known fan of Italian culture, living in Naples for years and even taking an Italian woman as his wife. Holding anti-German and anti-Turkish sentiments due to his time fighting for Italy in the Great War as a pilot and Ardito, Shimoi has long thought of himself as an honorary Italian, and his old friends such as Mussolini, Corradini, and D’Annunzio all agree, even collaborating to help bring the Rome-Tokyo Raid come together in 1920, as performed by famed aviator and friend Arturo Ferrarin. Founding the Japanese literature magazine ‘Sakura’ following the Great War and after settling down, he would do his duties for both Italy and Japan while spreading the ideas of Bushido culture throughout areas of Italy while seeking to fuse his Japanese-based ideas with Italian ideas of Socialized Nationalism, National Populism, Totalism, and Legionarism. Though getting on in years, Shimoi would still be a valuable asset to any force, and so we shall take him on as a military officer and advisor for the foreseeable future. Hopefully the Samurai of Fiume lives up to his name."

italianrepublic.201.d:0 "Following our move to usher in a new era for Italy under a 'Unitary Republic', there has been a growing schism between the dominant Republican and Monarchist factions within the ANI, with more minor factions such as Giovanni Papini’s Futurists rising up from within by using this rising tide of chaos as the perfect cover. While the party and its leading Republican wing has been led by the ANI's leading co-founder Enrico Corradini since its inception, the son of influential party chief Costanzo Ciano, Count Galeazzo Ciano, has steadily risen through the party ranks to become the de facto leader of the ANI's monarchist clique. Fearing that our aims of our nationalist revolution might become tainted by the interference of the aristocratic elite, Republicans have put forth the young ANI firebrand Dino Grandi as a compromise candidate thanks to his contacts and sympathies on both sides of the aisle, while the Right Futurists have brazenly put Papini himself forward instead, citing that the only way to heal the ANI’s ideological schism is to rally around a candidate unbiased to either major side. Only one can rise to lead the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana and wider Italy, so who shall lead us as we step towards our destiny?"

However, debate now rages within the ANI - primarily within the Monarchist faction of [ITA.GetLeader] now in control - as to whether parliamentary monarchism should be reintroduced to Italy. If so, the House of Savoy would return as the rightful monarchs of our reborn kingdom. However, we could simply embrace our aristocratic and elitist traditions without fully dredging up an institution many within the ANI find outdated while still respecting the former royals and their place within our culture. What shall be the future of Italy’s political system as [ITA.GetLeader] plays with the nation’s fate in the palm of his hands?"
italianrepublic.202.a:0 "The House of Savoy shall be reinstated as the true monarchs of Italy!"

italianrepublic.203.d:0 "The heavens cry torrential tears and let loose their thunderous wailings, for our beloved King Viittorio Emanuele Ferdinando Maria Gennaro di Savoia has finally passed away. The famed Prince of Naples, the beloved Sciabolettea (Little Saber) or il Re soldato (the Soldier King), our beloved national father has been finally laid to rest after passing away in his sleep peacefully at the age of 78. As the government prepares to lay the former monarch to rest in a lavish and respectful ceremony, and as the clergy and aristocracy debate on whether to either bury him at the traditional resting place of the House of Savoy at Hautecombe Abbey in Southern France or in the Roman Pantheon here in Italy where his grandfather Victor Emanuel II and his father Umberto I are buried, the nation and the next king prepare for the future. \n\nNow, the late Victor Emmanuel’s only son Umberto Nicola Tommaso Giovanni Maria di Savoia shall rise to the throne as King Umberto II. Like most heirs in the House of Savoy’s history, Umberto has a background steeped in military education and experience, but is lacking in political knowledge due to the House of Savoy not teaching political matters to their issue, as it is expected each monarch will learn the political world after taking office. As such, Umberto II has a lot to learn about being a true king and political leader, but his military expertise shall aid Italy in our imperialist ambitions for years to come, or at least we hope."

Giuseppe Ferdinando had faced an uphill battle to earn the trust of the Italian people who viewed the new King as nothing more than a puppet of the Austrian Empire. Over time, Giuseppe Ferdinando had proved himself to be a compassionate, moral, and upstanding monarch, worthy of Italy’s respect. With the king’s passing, the title of head of Habsburg-Tuscany is passed down to Ferdinand’s brother Peter Ferdinand, who has chosen to rule as Pietro Ferdinando I."
italianrepublic.204.a:0 "An unlikely hero in Italy’s darkest hour."

italianrepublic.205.t:0 "Pietro Ferdinando I Passes Away"
italianrepublic.205.d:0 "The nation once again enters a state of mourning as Archduke Peter Ferdinand of Austria, known to his subjects as Pietro Ferdinando I, has passed away. Much like his brother, Pietro Ferdinando maintained a hands-off approach in his rule, leaving the day-to-day functions of the government to the Signoria Federale. While Pietro Ferdinando’s rule was mostly uneventful and his eccentricities were not as well known as his brother’s, he was well respected among the Italian people. With the king’s passing, the title of Grand Duke of Tuscany is passed down to his son Gottfried, who has chosen to rule as Goffredo I."

italianrepublic.206.t:0 "The Alleged Life of Christ"
italianrepublic.206.d:0 "With Giovanni Papini rising to take lead of the ANI and our wider slice of Italy, the controversial and polemic author has begun to have his works re-appraised and re-evaluated by local academics and literary experts as these once hotly debated pieces of literature come to form the foundations of our highly syncretic government that shall fuse Futurism with the Italian Right for the good of the nation and our soon-to-be united people. Despite many of his older works being brought back into the spotlight, none has garnered more attention than Papini’s ‘biography’ on the life of Jesus Christ published in 1923. Titled ‘Life of Christ’, the novel is unabashedly anti-semitic and widely considered to be pseudo-historical as it paints the life of Jesus Christ in a radical and reactionary light, but no idea put forward in the book has been as controversial as Papini’s adamant declaration that John the Apostle and Jesus Christ maintained a homosexual relationship together, with this alleged truth being later covered up by corrupt, traditionalist leaders of the early Catholic Church along with those who penned the first editions of the Bible - the reasoning being either to paint Jesus in a better light, as stated during Papini’s time as an atheistic firebrand, or as to spread the lie that homosexuality is a true sin as professed by Papini now after taking a softer but still ever mercurial stance towards faith. Controversial to say the least, the outrage surrounding some of Papini’s takes rising among Papini’s many enemies within the clergy, the large amount of Christian conservatives and nationalists within the wider ANI and beyond, and his many detractors among our intelligentsia that lie outside his small and sheltered clique of authorts, artists, and philosophers won’t stop him or his clique of radical Right Futurists from imposing their conception of the truth on Italian society as we rocket towards an unbound future atop these strange ideas."

italianrepublic.207.t:0 "The Tale of King Amadeus"
italianrepublic.207.d:0 "Back in 1870, Spain was ruled by King Amadeo I who still stands as Spain’s only monarch in its entire history to come from our own House of Savoy, with Amadeo - also called Amadeus - being the second son of Victor Emmanuel II and thus raised as the spare to the true heir, living most of his life as the Duke of Aosta like all second sons within the House of Savoy before him. However, Amaedo’s rule was doomed from the start as his Spanish domain rapidly decayed under mounting republican pressure, Carlist rebellions in the north, and the threat of Cuban independence. After just three tumultuous years on the throne, he abdicated in 1873 - famously calling the Spanish people ‘ungovernable’ before the Cortes Generales upon his exit - and thus the first Spanish Republic was born. Returning to Italy, he founded the Aosta branch of the House of Savoy, which was junior to the main line descended from King Umberto I which still rules North Italy to this day, but senior to the dukes of Genoa. Now with Italy being shattered, the Kingdom of Italy was once again restored under Prince Luigi Amadeo, the son of the ill-fated King of Spain. With our government sworn to the House of Savoy, and to the legacy of Amadeo I along with it, some radical warhawks within our ranks wish to see the old realm of our beloved Amadeus restored, calling for an Italian ‘reconquest’ of Savoyard Spain. Though utterly ludicrous, many still chomp at the bit for revenge against the Iberians for one past transgression or another, so should we take this rare opportunity to seize on some long forgotten ‘destiny’, or should we continue to focus on Italian matters first and foremost, for the peninsula and the wider Italian sphere is unstable enough as it is..."
italianrepublic.207.a:0 "Reclaim the legacy of Amadeo I and ride to Iberia!"
italianrepublic.207.b:0 "We have more pressing and realistic matters to attend to."

italianrepublic.208.t:0 "Amadeo Avenged!"
italianrepublic.208.d:0 "After six decades, King Luigi has avenged his father and had successfully led a military campaign to bring the unruly Spanish lands under the House of Savoy once more. With the Bourbon loyalists, Carlist pretenders, and the Anarchist rabble driven into hiding by our mighty army, we must now decide what to do with the former domain of King Amadeus. Shall we allow the Spanish a degree of autonomy in exchange for their government proclaiming Luigi as the new King of Spain, or shall we put an end to any motion of Spanish autonomy and usher in a new glorious union between our two nations?"
italianrepublic.208.a:0 "Allow the Spaniards autonomy under the House of Savoy."
italianrepublic.208.b:0 "We shall grant the Spanish an equal standing. Proclaim the Italo-Spanish Union!"
italianrepublic.208.c:0 "We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. Unite the Crowns!"

italianrepublic.209.t:0 "A Choice for the Throne"
italianrepublic.209.d:0 "With the monarchist wing of the ANI rising to dominance under the likes of the Cianos and Dino Grandi, the most obvious step forward now is to crown a new monarch. However, such a seemingly simple question has caused no end of debate both open and behind closed doors as ecstatic monarchists and their begrudging republican allies all argue on who shall take the throne. Although all serious debaters on this topic naturally support someone from the House of Savoy which has been Italy’s royal house for decades, which specific member of the House of Savoy should be picked is an entirely other matter, with the former king Victor Emmanuel III still supported by many despite having possibly fallen in with dubious extremist groups to the South, and with most other senior Savoyard members currently serving loyally under Amadeo in Sardinia with no desire to betray their countrymen by coming here, so which scion of the Savoyard line that we actually stand a chance of swaying to our cause shall come to rise as the new King of Italy once and for all?"
italianrepublic.209.a:0 "Crown Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi and famed Arctic explorer."
italianrepublic.209.b:0 "Crown Eugenio, Duke of Ancona in line for the Dukedom of Genoa."
italianrepublic.209.c:0 "Crown Umberto, Prince of Piedmont and rightful heir to his father’s former throne."

Although talks of a possible ceasefire would seem like the obvious option, some within our command are convinced that the Habsburg aberration is on its last legs, and simply few more forceful pushes would finally collapse the beast forever. The decision we shall take will be monumental in the future of both Italy and Austria."

italianrepublic.7001.b:0 "We shall rescue more of our brothers!"

itaforpol.1.d:0 "With our recent decision to form an independent sphere of influence, there only lingers one question in the minds of the nation, what shall Italy's alliance be called. After some days of debate with close advisors, from Rome, [ROOT.getleader] announces the birth of the..."

itaforpol.2.t:0 "Holy Italia's place in the World"
itaforpol.2.d:0 "With our solidification of the Neosanfedisti's benevolent rule in Italy, growing prosperity and peace, many yet wonder, we have peace at home, but what of the world? From the rise of the Communards to the Great Civil War in America, the world around us is shifting into tempestuous times, and it seems as if bloodshed lies around every corner, we must ask ourselves what shall become of Italy in these difficult times."
itaforpol.2.a:0 "We should turn inwards, for the safety of Italy and the church"
itaforpol.2.b:0 "Our Holy State shall shape the world in the image of our lord"

itaforpol.3.d:0 "A growing power following the reunification of the Italian Peninsula, the [From.GetName] has seen fit to try and claim a place in the sun, and have offered us a part in the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. While not perhaps as much of a formidable power as the Germans or French, joining with them could decide the fate of our people and Europe as a whole for centuries to come."

itaforpol.4.d:0 "Whether they recognize the ascendant trajectory of Italy and it's place in the world, or simply fear being in the path of it, the [From.GetName] have wisely decided to take their place in the coming Italian future by our side."
itaforpol.4.a:0 "Our might grows!"

itaforpol.5.t:0 "The [From.GetName] have shunned us!"
itaforpol.5.d:0 "Shocking news from our envoy, as despite our efforts to the contrary, the [From.GetName] has rejected our proposal for an alliance. While [ROOT.getleader] had hoped that they would see the mutual benefit in helping empower an Italian Alliance to secure our place in Europe, it seems that they thought differently."
itaforpol.5.a:0 "They will regret this in twenty years."

itaforpol.6.t:0 "A Brotherhood with the Italians?"
itaforpol.6.d:0 "A growing power following the reunification of the Italian Peninsula, the [From.GetName] has seen fit to try and claim their own place in the sun, and offered the Belgrade pact a part in their growing sphere of influence. They sent an envoy which arrived in the City of Belgrade this morning, offering a merger of our alliance into the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. While their Dalmatian claims directly contradict any ambitions of Yugoslavism, and this would certainly mean a loss to the independence of our foreign policy, they are rivals of the Austrian menace, a fact which has not been overlooked by [ROOT.getleader]. Whatever we choose, it will decide the fate of the Mediterranean for ages to come."
itaforpol.6.a:0 "We stand with the Italians!"
itaforpol.6.b:0 "We stand alone."

cathitaly.2000.t:0 "The Consecration of France?"
cathitaly.2000.d:0 "In 1917, in the small Portuguese village of Fatima, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to three shepherd children over the course of five months. In these visitations, the Virgin would share with the children everything from visions of Hell, to prophecies of the future. One of these prophecies foretold the fall of the Eldest Daughter of the Church, France, to the Syndicalist menace. In the same vision, the Mother of God warned that, unless the Holy Father, in union with all bishops of the world, consecrated France to her immaculate heart, the errors of the Commune would spread throughout the world./n/nWith Pope [ROOT.getleader] declaring the evils of Syndicalism and socialism, many within the hollowed halls of the Vatican have begin wondering if the Holy Father would be willing to do this consecration, in hopes of gaining Our Lady's favor in the coming wars against Syndicalism. To this end, a group of laity, priests, bishops and even a few cardinals have formally petitioned His Holiness to fulfill Our Lady's desires, and consecrate France to her Immaculate Heart. While such a consecration would do little in a material sense, the fact (or so-called fact due to the visons in Fatima being not but private revelations) that the Mother of God herself would be on the side of those who fight against Syndicalist tyranny may just be enough to win over the Holy Father. While on the other hand, such a grand consecration would no doubt be a costly affair, and many the sheer cost alone may scare the Successor of Saint Peter away from preforming the consecration. Either way, the Holy Father is expected to make a timely response to the petition, due to the sheer amount of people who have come to him with it."   
cathitaly.2000.a:0 "We shall fulfill Our Lady's wishes and consecrated France."
cathitaly.2000.b:0 "France is not enough! The entire world must be consecrated!"

### Decisions ###
BRG_pick_a_king:0 "The British Regency"
BRG_pick_a_king_desc:0 "Assembled at General Hobart's request, the Regency Council was formed with the sole purpose of finding and electing a new King for the British People. With the Windsors betraying every true blooded Briton when they fled to Canada, our possible pool of Kings and even a few Queens is quite large."

BRG_elect_ernest:0 "Elect the Duke of Brunswick"
BRG_elect_ernest_desc:0 "While the idea of electing many a German monarch seems rather outlandish to our supporters, we have managed to find a candidate that would be satisfactory to most concerned. Ernest Augustus, grandson of George V of Hanover and thus both a Prince of Hanover and a Prince of the United Kingdom would be that man."

BRG_elect_bavarian:0 "Elect Rupprecht of Bavaria"
BRG_elect_bavarian_desc:0 "Rupprecht, King of Bavaria, loyal son of Germany, and Jacobite claimant to the English and Scottish thrones, is definitely not the first pick of the Regency. However, due to his German Kingship, meaning entrance into the Reichspact, along with his pre-existing claims to Britain make him an appealing option nonetheless." 

BRG_elect_jap:0 "Elect Prince Yasuhito of Japan"
BRG_elect_jap_desc:0 "By far the most far flung option presented before the Regency Council, Prince Yasuhito is actually quite the logical choice. Due to his long time courting of British Nobility, he is quite the familiar face to noble circles. Due to his status as Japanese Royalty, British entrance into the Japanese led Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere would be practically guaranteed. While the idea of Britain joining a military bloc half a world away might seem silly, we need allies, and Japan would certainly be a fitting one. "

BRG_elect_german_charles:0 "Elect Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha"
BRG_elect_german_charles_desc:0 "Seen as one of the most probable and likely candidates due to his pre-existing claim to the British throne, Charles Edward would indeed be quite the logical choice. A male-line descendant of the great Queen Victoria herself, not only would crowning Charles smooth things over with remaining Windsorite legitimists, it would cement our ties with Germany, and the Reichspact by extension."

BRG_elect_mick:0 "Elect the Head of Clan O'Neill"
BRG_elect_mick_desc:0 "Since the inception of the modern British state, the Irish have been something of a public enemy number one, thus few could expect that an Irishman could ever be seriously considered for the title of King of Britain. While Hugo José Jorge O'Neill is indeed a true blooded Irishman, he and his entire family have lived in Portugal since the 18th Century. Regardless, he is still an Irishman, and should we ever push forth our claims on the Emerald Isle, his Kingship could help smooth things over should push come to shove."

BRG_elect_randal:0 "Elect Randal McDonnell"
BRG_elect_randal_desc:0 "Among various candidates there stands the Earl of Antrim, Randal McDonnell. A native of Ulster, McDonnell is descended from Sorley Boy MacDonnell, who won for his family the right to remain in Ireland. During the Jacobite Wars, the McDonnells fought bravely for the Staurts, as did their sire clan in Scotland, Clan Donald, although the loss of the war greatly dimensioned the influence of the McDonnells of Antrim. Along with this storied history, the royal blood of the Stuarts flows through McDonnell's veins. Descended of James VI and I through his daughter Elizabeth Stuart, McDonnell is thus a claimant to the thrones of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, however distant."

BRG_elect_spanish_jacobite:0 "Elect the Spanish Jacobite"
BRG_elect_spanish_jacobite_desc:0 "A claimant to the Jacobite Succession via a bastard of James II,  Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart is in many ways the model noble. Dutifully serving the Spanish King, Jacobo, should he be elected, would fit the bill of a puppet King perfectly. Due to his place as a Jacobite claimant, he also has just the dash of legitimacy that makes him an all around perfect fit for King of Britain."

BRG_elect_franz_jospeh:0 "Elect the Prince of Liechtenstein"
BRG_elect_franz_jospeh_desc:0 "While the Principality of Liechtenstein itself is perhaps the smallest nation on Earth, it finds itself under the incontestable protection of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Due to this, it has been suggested that Franz Joseph II, prince of Liechtenstein, be crowned as King of Britain. Should he be crowned, he could pave the way for us to join Austria as brothers in arms." 

BRG_elect_bernhard:0 "Elect Bernhard of the Netherlands"
BRG_elect_bernhard_desc:0 "Married to Juliana, Heir Apparent to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld is one of the more agreeable candidates to the Throne of Britain. Besides his ties to the Dutch, which could come in handy should we find ourselves in a position to ally with them, the Prince of a German noble house. Due to this, our ties to the Reichspakt could be quite strong, although not as strong as others."

BRG_elect_wilhelmia:0 "Elect Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands"
BRG_elect_wilhelmia_desc:0 "The Queen of the Netherlands, Wilhelmina, one of few women presented before the Regency Council, is perhaps one of the safest choices that Hobart's Regency could actually make. Due to years of experience, she already knows the ins and outs of governance, she also knows when she has overstepped, meaning she wouldn't get in Hobart's way. Besides this, Wilhelmina has strong ties with the Reich, meaning that we would have an easy in with the Reichspakt. Of course her being the Queen of the Dutch also brings with it the chance for an alliance with them."
BRG_elect_julinia:0 "Elect Juliana of the Netherlands" 
BRG_elect_julinia_desc:0 "Daughter of Queen Wilhelmina, Juliana is the heir-apparent to the Throne of the Dutch. Possessing many of the same traits as her mother, Juliana's reign would differ in that she would eventually become the Queen of the Netherlands herself. Also differing from her mother is her choice of husband. Also a candidate himself,  Juliana is married to Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, meaning that our ties to Germany would be nearly as strong as our ties with the Netherlands would be."

BRG_elect_red_woman:0 "Elect Edith Wilson"
BRG_elect_red_woman_desc:0 "One of, if not the strangest, choice presented before Hobart and the Regency, Edith Wilson, widow of the late Woodrow Wilson who was President of America from 1913 to his death in 1923, could hardly be called a noble. While other options have the honor of being monarchs, or at least having some form of claim, Wilson lacks either of these. What she does have however, is ties to the American elite, especially the Bollings, her family by birth. She is also a descendant of the legendary Native American Matoaka - born Amonute and better known as Pocahontas, via her father. Living in self-imposed exile since the death of her husband due to his Presidency being blamed by Radicals for the current state of the country, she has seemingly embraced her Native side. Touring throughout Canada, Germany, Austria and even throughout the International (which is how the Regency learned of her in the first place), she has been raising attention to the plight of the Amerindian people, and has been trying to gain any kind of help for her kindred people. In her quest, she has met with the likes of Elwood Towner, who, despite his radicalism, has become something of an ally of Wilson. Regardless, despite her lack of European noble blood and her crusade to better the life of Native Americans, should the right people in power at the right time, crowning Wilson could gain us allies, ones we need so desperately."

BRG_elect_sark_woman:0 "Elect the Dame of Sark"
BRG_elect_sark_woman_desc:0 "If there is any person within the British Isles who deserves the title of Queen of Britain, it would be Sibyl Hathaway, third Dame of Sark, who inherited the position following the death of her father in 1923. Standing as one of the final bastions of reaction in the Isles following the British Revolution, she, like Hobart and his Old Guard remained at her post. Due to both the entrenchment on Sark and the relative harmlesness of her actions, the new government in London decided to keep the Dame under a lax house arrest. This, in turn, allowed Sibyl to establish contact with anti-syndicalists in Southern England. While far from being anti-Windsor, she has ruled Sark in an almost neo-feudalistic style, and has gained much admiration to some within the Regency Council. However, due to her more feudalistic leanings, many in the Council fear she may butt heads with Hobart, due his preferred style of military governance."

### Focuses ###
BRG_death_to_revoltuion:0 "Death to the Revolution!"
BRG_death_to_revoltuion_desc:0 "The aftermath of the British Revolution has left its stain on every aspect of British society. The Red Terror killed thousands, the Revolution halted centuries of civilization and without the Home Isles the Empire has been treading on precarious ground, constantly threatening to break apart moreso than it already has. Colonies in Africa and Asia were lost and those that remain have achieved a level of autonomy unacceptable in a previous age. This doesn't even mention the horrors of Syndicalist rule on the Isles. Political expression was restricted, economic growth aborted and social harmony overturned. If Hobart is to reverse the devastation he now presides over, he has a lot of work ahead of him. "
BRG_manhunt_mosley:0 "Hunt for Mosley"

Hobart has already assembled little more than a kangaroo court who sentenced Mosley to death in absentia, now all that's left is to find the bastard. Even now soldiers, police and civilians alike fan out across the countryside scouring every basement and hidey hole they can find to give Mosley a taste of real British justice."

When the Coal Miners Strike spiraled into civil war, it was the TUC who asserted itself as leading the Syndicalist cause. It was also the TUC who committed explicit treason in forcing the British government to flee and then usurped that government’s power. Last, but certainly not least, it was through the TUC that Mosley gained power. Since the Revolution the TUC has hobbled along but is left on life support. We shall end this lingering threat once and for all."

While the top layer of government is filled with Hobart and his clique under them lie layers and layers of Maximist administrators. Until now Hobart has kept them in place for lack of a better option. Now both Hobart and his government have grown tired of looking at them over their shoulders. A purge shall commence and finally wipe the Red filth away from the Government."
BRG_first_eco_reforms:0 "Initial Economic Reforms"
BRG_first_eco_reforms_desc:0 "The British economy is in shambles. The policy of rampant nationalization pursued by the Syndicalists, combined with Mosley’s irresponsible militarization, has left the economy a confused jumble of private, partially nationalized and wholly nationalized businesses. This has left British industry far behind its rivals in Paris or Berlin. While a more thorough reform program has yet to take form some emergency measures can be taken to start to untangle the web and reverse the damage."
BRG_purge_army:0 "Purge the Armed Forces"
BRG_purge_army_desc:0 "While a lot of the Army officers kept their commands through the Syndicalist and Maximist purges with both their heads and loyalties intact, the same cannot be said of the rank and file. A majority of the common soldiers come from poor neighborhoods where Syndicalist currents ran deep. In the aftermath of the coup many of these Reds have formed a united opposition to the new regime called the New Roundheads. While most have kept order to some degree, mostly constraining their resistance to disobeying commanders, a few have already taken to the hills to take up arms against Hobart. If we are to secure our new state we must purge these men. They will be arrested en masse and whipped back into compliance, literally if need be. Those who already took up arms are too far gone and shall be executed."
BRG_home_countries:0 "Secure the Home Countries"

They look back on the relative stability of the Union days with fondness. If we are to win the hearts as well as the minds of the people we must remedy this situation. We shall raise local militia across the nation to augment the Army which has been stretched thin. These men, while usually poorly trained, will be able to more quickly respond to local terror attacks and give people back the sense of security they long seem to have lost."
BRG_return_of_exiles:0 "Return of the True Exiles"
BRG_return_of_exiles_desc:0 "With the state more or less secure Hobart has extended an invitation for the Exiles return. However he has attached an important caveat. To come back they must renounce the House of Windsor. Hobart has decided the House of Windsor lost their mandate to rule the moment they left Britain to the Syndicalist vultures. As such they and their supporters will be barred from the Islands indefinitely. This provision was originally discouraged as many of Hobart’s advisors thought that few would take up the offer. They have been pleasantly surprised with the number of immigrants from the Entente. Hobart isn’t though. He knows as much as anybody that they are tired of war, tired of exile, tired of politics. They just want to come Home, Windsor or not."

His struggle against the despotic Parliament has been unfairly demonized by British history, up until now. History has been fixed to the right view, the view that Charles was unjustly murdered by the people, led by evil men. Cromwell is not a man to look at favorably, he is little better than Robspierre! Instead the men of the Cavaliers like Prince Rupert and John Byron among others. Some will be worried that the love of a man widely seen by the public as a despot will mean, but the public will learn to think what we tell them to."

While industrialization has done much to build our modern world it has also done much to exacerbate our human faults as well. By rolling back the clock somewhat and reminding the people of their ideal long past we can refocus their energies away from us to achieve that ideal. If they do then that would be preferable but even if they dont they will be too busy trying to oppose us."

However these Guilds have been inefficiently managed by a single Guild Master. While some of these Masters, like that of the aviation industry’s Sydney Camm, have been able and up to their task, more often than not they haven't. In any case these measures were intended to be stopgaps until a better system had been found. That system has been found through reform. Instead of one Guild Master, the Guilds will be run by Guild Councils so one man's inadequacy won't drag down the whole group."

The state is an organism unto itself. It acts as it should to survive. Its organs, the people, are used by the state to fulfill its survival. This theory has never been put to the test. Through our control of the political system and our influence over the people however we have formed the world's first truly organic state. The state moves and the people react, not the other way around."

This fact is no less true on the geopolitical scale, especially for a state like our new Britain. A Catholic nation ruling over a Protestant populace next to a Syndicalist-Atheist revanchist regime. Already that very description illustrates the difficult position we find ourselves in. However, in faith all men may find peace and harmony. While France may be long gone, the rest of Europe are still good Catholics. By using our new found piety we can reach out a hand to the Continent and be confident that someone will grasp it."

The people by and large hate us, or at the very least are not in favor of us, but yet here we remain. To all modern political theorists such a state of affairs should be impossible, yet we persist. That is because we have forged a strong alliance of new pious aristocrats, dependent on the state for their lives and their wealth. With such a short and tight leash they have lended us a fair amount of resources to keep the people in line. Meanwhile the people grow more and more accustomed to us. Eventually they might even love us. But that is for the future."

BRG_catholic_corporatism_desc:0 "Opposed to the rampant nationalizations of the degenerate Syndicalists and the equally rampant privatizations of the effete liberals, Ramsay has found a new middle ground between the two. Industries will be organized under large Corporations as a level between the guilds and government. Not businesses in the traditional sense they will serve more as economic advisory boards for industries. In this role they will collect data, process it and then come to the best way forward as well as negotiating with any workers who resist their God given purpose to work. These corporations will also be overseen by the Church to make sure they resist the working man's natural affinity to left wing subversion."

With time, patience and determination we can save England and bring God's Blessings upon it once more."

Any attempt to reform them would be at best delaying their inevitable slide back into revolutionary disobedience. To leave the worker without any way of organizing however would also bring about unrest. To remedy this situation Ramsay has decided to organize a series of guilds.

An emphasis on tradition, a new found Catholicism and a rabid hatred of Syndicalism define their views. To a nation fresh off the political whiplash of the progressive decentralized TUC which then snapped to despotic authoritarianism under Mosley, it remains to be seen just how they would accept this new radical change in direction.

To the Syndicalist and the Bolshevik all wealth should be concentrated in the hands of the government, leaving nobody any richer than before and most people in fact poorer. Ramsay however wants the wealth to be given directly to the people, not to the state and not to those who no longer need it. Those who hoard too much wealth like a dragon of Arthurian legend will be forced to hand it over to the newly established Department of Equal Equity which will then distribute it to those who need it through various social programs. Some decry this as Syndicalism. Ramsay will see how much they whine when the money comes their way."

The Syndicalists actively worked against such patriotism to varying degrees of effect further reducing the latent love of country every populace needs.

The Legion knows this idiocy for what it is, allowing criminals to run rampant over a vulnerable populace. To fix this the Castle Laws have passed into law allowing any person who feels genuinely unsafe the right to defend themselves, with deadly force if necessary. Our critics worry this will put vulnerable minorities at risk from wanton killings but the Legion takes them with a grain of salt.

However, the Legion knows the role aristocracy plays in English society as a link to the past and the cornerstone of traditional currents in society. To marry the Legion to the degeneracy that seems natural to aristocracy a new class of aristocrats will be created. These nouveau riche will be loyal Legionaries who will police the others. Not only will they keep them in line with the new states values but they will also act as spies to weed out any plots to overthrow the state."

To remedy this situation the Legion will open new businesses of all sizes and types to cater to a wide range of people looking for employment.

Not because they feel like they should, but because they know they must. The stereotypical stiff upper lip has turned into an iron determination to survive any challenge, overcome any hurdle and to reach ultimate prosperity and happiness by nearly any means necessary.

He would be a visible and compelling figure to rally the nation around. Of course he would have no real power but his very presence would do much to legitimize the Hobart regime. To choose this new monarch however Hobart will hold an election. The Windsors of course will not be included and any write in votes for them will be discarded.

Then, in 1653 the Army again took the lead with Oliver Cromwell leading the Commonwealth for five glorious years. Like Cromwell before us we now lead a Kingdom without a King. Unlike Cromwell however we will be sure that the British people will never again be slaves to some man pretending at divine rule."

In some areas the state was near omnipotent while other areas went months or even years without a government official issuing orders. Hobart however will be even in his rule. All power will be centralized in London. With this comes a necessary expansion of the bureaucracy but Hobart is already writing orders to recruit a new “Army Bureaucratic Corps” to oversee the nation. With the state administration firmly in the Army’s hands it will be all the harder for any subversive elements to undercut our rule."

Some say this is a dangerous intermingling of the military and industry and might lead to bad things down the road but Hobart is not worried.

To fix it Hobart has found two options that he likes best but is unable to choose. The first option is to go all in on nationalization, just give it some better organization and leadership. The second option is to re-privatize everything and take the government out of the economy as much as possible. Both of these options have their pros and cons but one must be chosen."

While Britons have always been proud of their country, it's never been to the extent of the Americans or Germans or hell, even the French. It was this lack of patriotism that gave the Syndicalists their opening to worm their way to power. In Hobart’s new government however the British people will find a nation to be proud of.

Through his force of will he bends the inflexible into shape but what if whoever takes over after him is as limp-wristed as George V? To secure the military’s new found primacy Hobart has drawn up the New Concordant. It is simply a legal document outlining various new laws which give the military primacy in government, industry and law.

In view of that fact Hobart has decreed that the National Economic Planning Board will be at least 90% staffed with military officers. Some civilians will be let on to give the veneer of equal power sharing. But, with the officers outnumbering them handedly there is little they could do. Also, and this is probably an unrelated boon, but with the military controlling the Board, the Board will work in the military’s interest in all things in turn."

All of that before the effort it would take to rebuild it into something worth keeping. Rather than waste precious time in such a sisyphean endeavor Hobart has decided to just bring the whole system down. All industries will be privatized. Any economic engine owned by the nation will be sold off to the highest bidder. Some worry that these new managers will be unqualified to manage some of these businesses and just lead them into the ground. Hobart can only shrug.

basedbrit.1.t:0 "Consolidating Power"
basedbrit.1.d:0 "The tyrannical overreaches of the Maximists had been the final straw, before Hobart had ordered the divisions loyal to him to overthrow them. The trade unionists who had been in power and hiding before the Maximists had seen Hobart’s men besieging the Maximists offices and the execution of their officials, and so foolishly came out in crowds to celebrate the change of power, expecting it was to go back to them. Needless to say that London was bathed in the same red blood of syndicalists as the banners they had waved in naivety, thinking that Hobart would really give power back to those that had failed the same revolution they preached. Now those socialists who had survived those massacres against them are in hiding, undeniably bitter and shocked at how Hobart had cleansed the slate completely of them, despite them putting their trust in him that he had come along to their ideals. \n\nYet it was not only the socialists who were thrown aside in shame, but also the exiled Windsors in Canada, who had expected Hobart to clear the way and welcome them home in open arms. They were promptly given a slap to the face when Hobart issued a decree barring them from returning to the isles, for they had betrayed the British people when they had not only failed to stop the bloodshed between state and people during the revolution of ‘25, but also cowardly ran away from the home isles. Now Hobart is standing in a very precarious and dangerous situation, for socialists and those loyal to the windsors are most assuredly plotting in their hiding. We must act fast if we wish for Britain to remain free, from Windsor or Syndie alike."

basedbrit.2.d:0 "While the revolution has been put down with the fist of Hobart, we cannot remain without support for too long before our precarious situation is brought down by popular uprising. Of course Hobart has already begun the process of accepting exiles back from Canada, particularly those who hold love for their isle and not any support for those cravens called the Windsors. Now there is as naturally expected some resistance to this and many of those stubborn conservatives remain alongside the Windsor king remain in Canada, however some political groups are willing to ditch the king and return home to join the process of creating a new system. \n\nOne such group seeking to return home being those moderate members of the Labour party that went to Canada alongside the Exiles under Clement Attlee. There is also of course the much more nationalistic and nordic following of the British Legion, and the accompanying Right Club under the head of Archibald Ramsey, who had converted to Catholicism in Canada due to his love and respect for the religion. \n\nNow Hobart must decide which group he will allow to join him in rebuilding Britain into a new and proper image. An image without that of the Windsors corrupting or destroying it."

Despite their relatively short time since arrival on the island, they have already made an impact in drastically increasing public support for the new Regime in Britain, as the people can see that Attlee is bringing Britain towards a political system similar to the Union as it keeps a kingless society, however not to far gone as the Maximists or Right wing clubs of the Exiles support. Thus utilizing the public support for a moderate republican system, Attlee has pushed Hobart into accepting some reforms in reducing his own executive power and accepting a parliament once more. Now Attlee is arguably in control of the nation, however he cannot fully take the lead in pushing the nation towards new heights as Hobart is in the president’s seat in government, thus Prime Minister Attlee has to run ideas for reform past him in order to get it accepted, for Hobart is ever paranoid about a return to the Union or to the old system of the Windsors."

basedbrit.5.d:0 "Firmly entrenching the newly arriving exiles is key to ensuring our foundations are not toppled by a dissatisfied populus, and so beginning to sway the majority of the British population to the newly arrived exiles ideals is necessary. Thus Hobart has given permission for massive rallies and government endorsed spreading of the nationalist message, paving the way for the population to be swayed over to a much more state friendly mindset. Already the nationalists have hopped onto this opportunity, with Joyce’s followers already organizing rallies to hopefully sway the populus over to their newly introduced mindset, and also potentially to scare off opponents with the numbers of the nationalist attendee’s. All the while Archibald Ramsay has been creating new clubs across various british regions to hopefully spread his Catholic ideals onto the more older and wealthier conservative attendee’s and any who might partake in such country clubs. \n\nAll this cannot be denied to have a positive effect in entrenching a new british state, one without the risk of Syndicalists or Windsors steering us astray, however Hobart watches with a worried eye as all the new praise and popularity of the current situation is going towards Joyce’s nationalists, with him who had made it possible increasingly losing public image in favor of the newly arrived nationalists."

Although both men differ in some political aspects their authoritarian leanings and anti-semitism have united them. With their power based united and growing they have marched on London and demanded to be handed the reigns of power.

basedbrit.7.d:0 "Through the calculated use of threats and force James Joyce and Arnold Leese now hold Britain in their hands. While they bicker about the finer points differing their ideologies, their shared hatred of International Jewry and an almost rabid desire to wipe the stain of ‘Syndicalist Degenerate Progressivism’ off the Isles has united their two once disparate movements into one. Already they have made a dramatic move to remake their new and idealized Britain. In General Decree Number One both Joyce and Leese have declared the ‘Jewish Race’ to be unredeemable and a dangerous fifth column. As such they have declared any Jew caught on the British Isles after one month will be imprisoned indefinitely. This has aroused equal parts anger, disbelief and acceptance by the British population. Those following the diarchy have naturally sung the praises of this new edict and have begun to list all the Jews they know to hand over to the authorities. The rest of Britain however is confused as to why and how the edict will be carried out. The Union had a robust Jewish community. To do away with them, especially so rapidly, could only mean bad things. Already protests have begun by Jews and their sympathizers against the new decree. Time will tell if their shouts will fall on deaf ears however."

Totalist thugs patrol the streets, Syndicalists across Britain are mobilizing to save their broken homeland and the few remaining Legionaries refuse to go down without a fight. However, Hobart has found an unlikely and some say undesirable ally in The Right Club. Formed by a cabal of right wing and Catholic former and current aristocracy they have found a new home in the new Britain after suffering years of inglorious exile in Canada with the rest of the British government. Now however, while Edward and his friends wine and dine in Ottawa the Right Club has come home and quickly become the poster child of the new British far right. While not as radical as some like Joyce and Leese, their traditionalist, aristocratic and more importantly Catholic leanings have turned many a common man away from them. They are a snapshot of the Britain the Union worked so hard to destroy. Ultimately the Union failed and with the death of the Union the old regime's sympathizers have come out of the woodwork to give this new right wing a serious political voice. The Club's words carry real weight and that cannot be dismissed so easily. Their leader, Archibald Ramsey, has offered Hobart access to the vast wealth and resources of the Club, in exchange for forming a cabinet under him. What should we do?"

Like a lightning bolt Archibald Ramsay has become one of if not the most powerful men in Britain, rivaled only by Hobart himself. However the old general seemingly couldn’t win this last, most important battle. Through political maneuvers so rapid and cynical they would make even the most pragmatic of men’s heads turn Ramsay has rapidly outmaneuvered Hobart. Today Archibald Ramsay has been named Chancellor of Britain making him second in command of the nation. Those in the know already are aware of the general's powerlessness in the face of the Club. That leaves Archibald Ramsay and his Right Club in control of the nation and signals the ultimate conquest of England by the Roman Catholic Church according to detractors. What comes next is not certain but already what Church of England officials came out of hiding have spoken of their misgivings and whispers of a Catholic restoration in England whirl like a tornado, pulling at the threads of the broad rightist coalition Ramsey leads. Rasmey, for his part, has been silent on these claims, although he has never outright denied them. Now all of Britain, and indeed the world, waits with bated breath to see what the Club does next."

Facing a hostile populace, an unruly Army and an uncertain foreign situation Hobart has bested all the vultures circling him and now has total control over the new Britain. This has worried some as speculations on Hobart’s monarchist leanings continue to circulate. However people close to him profess that from what they know of Hobart, his views have undergone a serious shift. The Hobart of 1919 is not the Hobart of now. He now has a burning hatred of the Windsors who cowardly fled England rather than face down the Revolutionaries. Indeed they speculate that Hobart has come to despise monarchy as a whole. Instead they guess that Hobart will instead keep the power centralized in the military “the only institution left that can truly uphold British values” by his own words. Despite their professions however it's ultimately up to Hobart as to what he will do ultimately. "

While the Trojans celebrated their victory the treacherous Greeks emerged from the horse and slaughtered Troy in its moment of farcical victory. Ramsay sees the Jewish races as the new Trojan Horse who work not for the betterment of their host nations but in pursuit of the Council of Zion’s esoteric and sinister goals. Ramsay has proclaimed that he will not throw Britain to the wolves just as he has taken control. To face this new ‘Trojan Horse’ as he likes to call the Jews as a group he has issued Emergency Decree One which requires all Jews to register in the new National Registry of Enemy Aliens. Many British Jews have taken the opportunity to flee the isle, and those who stay will be closely watched for when they ultimately slip up and give Ramsay some sort of proof of their evil ways."

basedbrit.12.t:0 "An End to Party Politics"
basedbrit.12.d:0 "Today, to a mildly shocked nation, the old General Percy Hobart announced his retirement from politics like the great Lord Fairfax of the Civil War. He claims the reasons are for his health, which may be partly true, but it's been plainly clear for a while that Hobart has been little more than a figurehead for the Right Club. As Hobart and Ramsay fight more and more over their differing opinions it's clear that Hobart’s time in government is over. Any remaining influence he could have had over the government is long since gone and he has lost control of his own Revolution. After Hobart was shooed off the stage by Ramsay the new undisputed head of Britain made a shock announcement. He launched into a long tirade against party politics and blamed such a system for causing the Syndicalist Revolution and the resulting moral and ethical degeneration of the national politic. To remedy the crisis Ramsay banned all political parties which had been allowed to form under Hobart. He forcefully absorbed the myriad of right wing parties and banned anything any more left than him or the British Legion. Leftist leaders have been rounded up and arrested across Britain, all save for Attlee who has escaped once more. The potential for British democracy had been smothered in its cradle and as he finished his speech Archibald Ramsay, its murderer, was showered with applause."

basedbrit.13.t:0 "Aristocratic Alliance"
basedbrit.13.d:0 "Archibald Ramsay and the Right Club have begun reaching out to British aristocratic exiles across the Empire to find supporters to bring into the country. These aristocrats have long been left without property and incomes forcing them to drain their vast wealth reserves. Some lesser nobles have even been forced into menial labor to make ends meet. As a way to secure their allegiance Ramsay has promised them a full and complete restoration of their rights, properties and incomes once his rule is secure. Such an offer is tempting, even to those who originally were not a fan of Ramsay. Already numerous former aristocratic families have left their exiles in India, Australasia and Canada and traveled back to the Home Islands to claim what they lost all those years ago. This ‘Great Reclamation’ has ruffled feathers as police and army units repossessed former estates for their old owners, kicking out families and businesses that inhabited them since they were seized during the Revolution. Astute observers have also noted that a vast majority of these aristocrats invited back home have been Catholics. Rumors of the Right Clubs embracing of Catholicism had been stirring since Ramsay first entered the government under Hobart. Now it looks increasingly likely that those rumors are true. Nevertheless it is much too late to turn back now. Britain is too far down their new path to turn back now."
basedbrit.13.a:0 "The chains reforged."

basedbrit.14.t:0 "Local Authority"
basedbrit.14.d:0 "As Ramsay reforges Britain into his ideal society he has embraced the idea of decentralization to a degree. While the TUC in the Union under Mosley kept a tight leash on most anything done anywhere in the Union, Ramsay has taken the opposite approach. Instead he has delegated more power to local governance now headed by local aristocrats. These newly empowered aristocrats have wasted little time in using their new shreds of power to reassert their own, and by extension governmental, control over the ever rambunctious lower class. This has not gone unnoticed by the once more downtrodden and already clashes have begun between remnant Syndicalists and government forces. These skirmishes are however minor and pose little if any real threat to unseating Ramsay. It's also been noticed that Ramsay seems to be giving more power faster to Catholic aristocrats. As people once again wonder just where Ramsay’s religious allegiances lie they all know in the back of their heads where this leads and few are prepared to welcome it."

basedbrit.15.d:0 "As part of Ramsay’s new propaganda blitz against the remnant dissident factions across the nation he has taken to lionizing the Cavaliers of the old Civil War. The Cavaliers, those who supported King Charles I in the Civil War, have been hailed as true Englishman who knew where their true loyalties lay. Their heroics and tenacity were undercut by the unfaithfulness of the people who were lured away from their rightful liege by Cromwell and his cabal. Not only that but Ramsay has encouraged the archetypal cavalier style among his friends and associates. This has drawn some laughter of course, but never within Ramsay’s earshot."

basedbrit.17.d:0 "Today Ramsay has signed the Roman Concordat in Rome with the Pope. The Concordat in simple terms brings the Church of England back under Papal purview. This has finally mended the British schism from Rome. Already Ramsay has reportedly picked out a new Archbishop of the newly Catholic Archdiocese of Canterbury, the hardline Francis Bourne. To do this Bourne has been granted significant autonomy within the Church. This autonomy however has strict limits especially when dealing with core Church doctrine. With Bourne at his back there is no doubt that Ramsay will seek to destroy the Church of England on the Home Islands and bring Britain firmly back into the Catholic world. This has been met with condemnation from across the English world. In Canada the Exiles have denounced this move in the strongest language possible and still maintain the Church of England is wholly and totally separate from Rome. The English Archbishop of Canterbury-in-Exile Cosmo Lang also issued a statement urging resistance to efforts to reconvert the Islands. This has been taken up by rag tag Moral Defense Units, little more than zealous mobs, who have gathered and pledged to resist any conversion attempts. It remains to be seen if they could live up to such lofty pledges."
basedbrit.17.a:0 "England has once more seen the Light!"

basedbrit.18.t:0 "Return of the King?"
basedbrit.18.d:0 "With the last and greatest of Ramsay’s reforms done it's now time to formally induct England back into the faith with the crowning of a truly Catholic monarch. This monarch will not lead some heretical ‘Church of England’ but will act in accordance to God’s true wishes as spelled out in the Bible. Resisting both the Protestant and English heathens will be difficult but with God's grace anything can be done. Ramsay has drawn up a list of suitable candidates. At the top of said list is Ramsay himself naturally. As the man who brought England to the light of Rome it's only natural he oversaw the cementing of Catholic influence on England for all time. Despite his want for the title however Ramsay feels it improper to simply crown himself King like a common usurper. He has no royal lineage in any case. Instead he will simply take the title of Lord High Chancellor, a title of no limits which will also be bestowed upon his son or other chosen heir. This will make him a King in all but name, but by that reasoning then isn't every autocrat a King? The second choice is Edward Fitzherbert, the 13th Baron Stafford as King Richard IV. As a descendent of Edward Stafford he has the blood of the Plantagenet Kings in his veins. While he has expressed no explicit interest in pushing his long since thought dead ancestral claim to the throne, an offer of the crown would be hard to turn down. Another option is Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria being crowned as James III. This is a truly radical proposal and has met with severe opposition. He is a German who fought hard against British troops in the Weltkrieg. To crown him could be seen as a slap in the face of all those who fought. However, the new Britain Ramsay leads is isolated. The Entente want nothing to do with him for obvious reasons and the Internationale sits on the other end of the Channel, watching the White Cliffs of Dover with vengeful eyes. If foreign alliances are not found soon then the light of God could be snuffed out of the British Isles once more. By crowning Rupprecht, Ramsay could draw closer to the Kaiser. Strange times breed stranger friends. Also he does have a claim to the Jacobite throne, however tenuous. He is the descendent of Charles of Sardinia who inherited the Jacobite claim after the extinction of the Royal Stuart line in 1807.\n\nThe final and most radical proposal is that of Sibyl Hathaway, Dame of Sark. An applauded neo-feudalistic, the Dame as ruled her island with an iron fist, even through the hell of syndicalist rule. A convert to Catholicism following the reforms of the Right Club, Hathaway is in many ways the perfect exemplar of the Right Club's ideals and values. Unlike the other candidates however, Hathaway has no ties to any foreign nation, although she had developed a Norman anti-syndicalist network during the pains of their rule. On top of this, she is of course a woman. While Queens of England are not a new concept, crowning one may be seen as weakness. Yet, it was a woman who almost lead England back into Rome's embrace, and Hathaway could be just that for us. Should she be crowned, it is expected she would take the name Mary II, to honor the last true Queen of England, and to denounce the protestant Mary II who brought nothing but pain to England."

However he recognizes the historical weight the title King of England commands in the British psyche, even still. Some have suggested they invite the King in Canada back, but Hobart has dismissed such suggestions out of hand. He gave up his throne the moment he left England to the Syndicalists. In response Hobart’s aides have brought a list of around a dozen names as suggestions for a new monarch. In the end Hobart knows who he chooses doesn't really matter as he will keep the power behind the throne but still, the choice would have tremendous symbolic value so it must not be taken lightly. To this end, Hobart has invited the great (or the most loyal anyway) minds in Britain to form a Regency Council, until such time that a new monarch has been chosen. Officially known as the Committee of Regency of Their Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, in its first official act, making using Hobart's vast emergency powers, the body has officially repealed the Act of Settlement, opening up the possibility of a Catholic on the British throne for the first time in over 200 years. If this move was a sign that the seeks to place a Catholic on the Throne, or was simply a way to make the process of selecting a new monarch the easier, remains to be seen."

Despite the panicked cries of the Royalists, England survived. At least until his idiot son mucked it up. He ruled an England that was approaching the prosperity it had never seen before. In recognition of his efforts Hobart has decided that Britons will never again be slaves to some King. Hobart instead has taken the title of Lord Protector and abolished the English throne. This has been met with disappointment and even anger by the rest of the Empire. They had expected Hobart to invite the King back to London but now these hopes have been dashed. Instead the King-in-Exile has released a statement declaring he is still King and that Hobart is a ‘petty usurper’ who ‘plays at King without calling it such’. This has been supported by the Entente as a whole. Despite this Hobart seems to have no intentions of reversing his decision and England sails into the future on uncertain waters."

In America democracy plunged the nation into not one but two civil wars in 100 years! In Russia the state constantly walks a tightrope between anarchy and despotism as its wobbly democratic institutions continue to threaten to fall. Hobart has seen democracy in action and has seen it fail time and time again. He has resolved to not make the same mistake once more. Instead he shall create a ruling junta led by himself. No elections, no pretense at ‘democracy’. Just the rule of law and order. Some of his more liberal advisors are dismayed at his decision but there is little they could do. With his power secure and troops still in the streets the people read the announcement of the canceling of elections and shrug apathetically. They just want peace and Hobart knows that. Those who do feel the need to protest will fall into line in time, one way or another."

The people will largely steer the ship of state but the military shall retain the right to intervene should a ‘radical’ party win too much. Some worry that this would end democracy in Britain but Hobart assures him that the Army would never wantonly crush any government that disagrees with them."

He had holed up with the last of his Maximists near Birmingham in an area once overlooked by police. The building he had holed up in was rather unassuming but as it was surrounded by a British Army regiment with a tank in support, it quickly became apparent that something was about to happen. As a man shouted at the building for Mosley to come out there was the slightest glint of a rifle scope in one of the windows. Before anybody could react, the crack of a rifle heralded the beginning of the Battle of Birmingham as it is now called. British soldiers stormed through the bottom floor in a ferocious battle with local blackshirts as the tank outside fired multiple rounds into the upper floors, blowing away huge sections of the facade. The outcome was never in doubt however. When British soldiers finally reached Mosley’s office they found the door had been blown off when a tank shell blew through the window. They ran through to find the one time Grand Protector of the Union of Britain on the ground sobbing and grabbing the stump where his left leg once was. It was quickly located on the other side of the room. Mosley looked at the soldiers and demanded they help him “so he may face trial as befitting a British citizen”. He was promptly shot dead by Pvt James Teaton. After reading the report submitted by the regiment Hobart simply shrugged and crossed Mosley’s name off of his list. One more enemy of the state is gone."

However, as previously said, it still limps on. Now however it is restrained to strictly dealing with the various unions that remain on the Island. Hobart however feels the body has outlived its usefulness. When the TUC tried to meet again today its remaining members were met with British soldiers who had chained the doors of the meeting room shut. They declared in no uncertain terms that the TUC was now an illegal organization and they had this one chance to turn and leave. If they remained they would be considered terrorists and arrested on the spot. Few delegates stuck around. Most knew this was an action long in the making and simply went home to find a new job.

Attlee however sees it differently. He was never a fan of TUC rule and even less so after Mosley took over. Now the TUC is done and a sense of normalcy has returned Attlee sees himself and his Labor Party as the final protectors of the rights of the workers left. While the new Labor Party are not revolutionary Syndicalists and are certainly not Maximists, Attlee knows the people are still suspicious.

While some vital industries like energy and water and transportation will remain in government hands the rest of the governments wide ranging monopolies are already in the process of being broken up and sold off once more. Whenever possible the government has also resolved to return private businesses to those who once ran it.

Reports have come in that across the nation Maxamist administrators simply changed their uniforms to avoid detection during the initial purge. With the work that came afterwards being so pressing, they were never thoroughly vetted. This has allowed dangerous elements to lurk in our power structure. These men are loyal not to the new Britain but to Syndicalism and Mosley himself. At the time it was needed as the state could not have survived if its entire bureaucratic machine was torn down at once. Now however the government has decided enough is enough. The apparatus of state at all levels will be filtered with a fine tooth comb. Those who are found to be lacking in loyalty will be fired and, if the need arises, arrested. A new cadre of bureaucrats have already been groomed to take their place so their absence will not be missed."

basedbrit.54.d:0 "The venerable General Hobart, Liberator of the Isles and the Saviour of our new Albion, has announced he is stepping away from politics and resigning from his post as President, effective immediately. To the public, this has been an upsetting announcement, but one that makes a kind of sense. Hobart is approaching his 60s and the stress of fighting a war, then a revolution, then a counter-revolution, and now serving as ceremonial face of the state have all combined their stress to age this poor old dog by at least a decade or more. However to those in the know within the government, it makes a different kind of sense. Prime Minister Clement Attlee has been consolidating power under himself for some time, rallying the conservative and liberal democratic opposition to Hobart. Hobart tried to spar against him and secure his seat but ultimately Hobart failed, falling to the rising might of Attlee. \n\nWith his sudden resignation, there will be snap elections for the Presidency - a new post left vacant by Hobart’s departure. These elections are merely a formality though, for Attlee dominates all with the Labour Party as the shining face of our reformed nation - the one Good Syndicalist among thousands of traitors. Behind this image, Attlee can say that he didn't partake in the horrors and excesses of Mosley or the other extremist revolution, for he was just a benign technocrat doing what he must to save his country. However, to keep appearances, a few other candidates for this largely powerless position have been raised. They are Attlee’s own Deputy Minister Arthur Greenwood, conservative Labour figure and staunch opponent to anything Syndicalist Hugh Gaitskell, General Hobart’s protégé and close friend General T.E.

Then Attlee got them all passed. Now nobody says anything. Instead they stand in awe of the new Britain Attlee has created. The explicitly revolutionary ideology of Syndicalism has finally worked within a democratic context. The doom and gloom of the right wing who predicted a return of the Maximists never came to pass. Yet, at the same time the far left who saw Attlee as a precursor to a return of TUC rule were also left disappointed. Instead the vast majority of Britons now enjoy a thriving democracy, a robust welfare state, workers protections unmatched in any non-Syndicalist nation and finally but almost certainly more importantly, peace. Britain finally knows peace after decades of tumult and upheaval. There are few who won't lay down their lives to defend this new peace either. "

In the halls of power there has been an incredible amount of shouting and even a couple of fist fights between the two as their political ideologies' differences become more and more pronounced. William Joyce sees Britons as the best and most civilized nation on Earth. With their liberation from Syndicalist slavery he believes it's their duty to expand across the world so that all might bathe in its civilizing light. He also believes that Britons should strive for peak physical fitness to bring out their natural physical superiority. Arnold Leese however has a different view. He believes that all Britons are imbued with the spiritual strength of the collective Aryan race. He believes that through spiritual purity part of that inherited power will be released, giving the average Briton almost superhuman strength and endurance. While Joyce believes that the Jews simply control society, Leese believes the International Jewish conspiracy extends even into people's souls. He believes that the existence of Jews corrupts the Spiritual collective of the people and acts as another suppressant of the Briton’s natural power. Joyce thinks this is all spiritualist nonsense, while Leese has begun to describe Joyce as a ‘kosher legionnaire’. In the end only one of these two can come out on top. Who should it be?"

He has begun a massive purge of remaining Churchmen and ordered MI6 to hunt down the subversive elements still in Britain. However, despite his leadership few see this as a true coup.

This revelation led to widespread protests from the more Anglican regions of the country and the Church of England itself, denouncing the decision as a betrayal of the 1701 Act of Settlement, and thus unconstitutional. The protests quickly scattered as Hobart’s regiments cracked down, leaving many to reluctantly accept the decision; most had accepted the decision - a sharp change in governance was not an uncommon occurrence in today’s Britain. Accepting such a decision, Rupprecht arrived in London only to be crowned a week after, ascending as Robert I, King of Britain and Bavaria. Across Europe and especially the German sphere, this event was met with great support.

This was met with more silence. Without a word Rupprecht was taken to Westminster Abbey where he was crowned as Robert I. When he left to greet the crowds outside he was met with a few boos but still more silence. There Rupprecht put all his speaking talents to work as much as possible giving a long and impassioned speech imploring the British people to put aside their biases and give him and his rulership a chance to speak for itself.

As a German, and a German known for authoritarian rule in his native Duchy at that, he was welcomed cooly by the populace.

This drew some agreement to the crowd but as a whole they said nothing and watched as this black sheep of the family walked to a waiting car to be taken to be crowned. When he left the Abbey and was taken to Buckingham Palace he was met by Hobart. Reportedly the two got into a hour long shouting match over the role of the King.

The King, for his part, after being crowned King Loigaire I, has sent suggestions to Hobart for doing just that. His first suggestions were state visits by him to both Dublin and Libson. The visit to Portugal he claims is to gather up the last of his things as well as to strengthen ties between Portugal and England. His visit to Ireland however has taken on a special significance to the King. Having never spent much time in Ireland as a boy and up until now, he seems almost desperate to reconnect with his Irish roots. While Hobart can’t find any real reason to deny the King this request it does make him nervous. Hobart might have his own designs on Ireland and to send the King on a friendly visit only to follow it with an invasion could seriously hurt the King's use as a diplomatic tool and therefore defeat the purpose of crowning a King at all.

Of course she never said the struggle had been dormant since the mid 1700s. Nevertheless when the telegram arrived for him from Hobart Jacobo initially didn't believe it. It took a call from Hobart to convince him of both the authenticity of the offer and to accept it. Now here he was, in a land he didn't know claiming a throne he never really wanted. He had also been getting some offers from a cabal of American fanatics to come take over there as well. He turned them down though, he knew what America did to Kings.

For our senior officers, most actually belonged to the various anti-syndicalist cliques, but this is not the case with all of them, one of the prime examples being Thomas Edward Lawrence. Lawrence, a veteran of the Great War, and the man who led Arab tribes in revolt against the Ottoman Empire, has up to now been neutral. Despite having served the Windsorite Empire, he stayed put in Britain, offering his services to the new Revolutionary government, much like General Hobart. Unlike Hobart however, Lawrence never joined a clique or made an effort to express his political leanings, this however, has changed. Upon learning of the ongoing review of the officer corps, Lawrence officially declared his total and undying allegiance to Hobart and his new government. Explaining away his previous apathy by saying he simply did not wish to see his home hurt enough more, he declared in no uncertain terms that he was never a socialist.

In fact, Hobart officially declared that should he die untimely, Lawrence would be his successor, practically making the second most important man in the nation, behind Hobart himself. While this relationship is quite strong, and despite the fact Lawrence is his heir-apparent, Hobart has not gone as far as to officially give Lawrence a seat in government. Seemingly strange for the next-in-line to not actually have a preexisting place in the hierarchy, Lawrence, to put it simply, doesn't care.

With the protests growing to such a strength, it is obvious we can no longer ignore them. Before Hobart lies two options. He can either cave to the demands of the protests and call for snap elections, though these would obviously be closely monitored, and radical parties and their supporters would be barred from taking part. The other option is to simply crack down on these fools. While yes, it would hurt us in the short term, it would show the people who are really in charge in this country.

The crown jewel of his armored career are aptly dubbed ‘Hobart’s Funnies’ - a nickname given to a series of tanks designed under Hobart’s direction, both during his time in the now-defunct People’s Engineers and in the re-rebranded Royal Engineers. Featuring modified armored vehicles sourced from our allies and contacts in nations such as France, Italy, Russia, and the Americas each modified and outfitted to perform a specific task, these Funnies have proven themselves time and time again. \n\nFeaturing tanks with scorpion or crab flails mounted to the front to clear mines, tanks with mounted flamethrowers that either tow a fuel tank or keep one internally depending on the model, tanks with bulldozers to clear obstacles like hedgerows and barricades, tanks with massive mortars instead of a main gun for busting bunkers, bridge-laying tanks, amphibious tanks like the Duplex Drives, fascine tanks, ramp tanks, searchlight-equipped tanks, plough tanks, onion mine layers and more, the list of Funnies never ceases to expand as Hobart and his Engineers crack on with their ingenious work. Utilized by our division both at home and abroad, and also sourced to our allies, these ‘Hobart’s Funnies’ are sure to aid any current or future war efforts as we continue to modernize our armed forces in an endless bid to win the global arms race."

Blair proved this time and time again as he sought to temper and moderate his former friend and political ally Oswald Mosley, but the Maximist wave was too strong, leaving Blair largely helpless to save his beloved Union from tyranny. Secretly aiding Hobart in his counter-revolutionary efforts while feeding info to Attllee and other resistance members, Blair did all he could, but many still view him as a traitorous Red. \n\nWith their close friendship still lingering and with Attlee’s unmatched power as Prime Minister, some have proposed that Clem should pardon Blair, either forcing him into an early retirement so long as he limits the inflammatory nature of his literature or giving him a position under Attlee where he can be easily monitored. However, more staunch anti-Syndicalists and Labour opponents state that despite Blair’s petty attempts at stopping Mosley, he still was a Revolutionary traitor, and as such, he deserves nothing less than life in prison.

As such, Prime Minister Clement Attlee has taken the initiative to not repeat the mistakes of the royalist Windsor regime that failed the nation before. We shall deal with these strikers with a velvet glove dyed red instead of the iron fist, for it is the only way to prevent history from repeating itself.

After over four minutes of this dense speech ridiculing our past failures while promising new futures, Attlee ended the speech with the triumphant and trumpeting line ’I will not cease from mental strife, nor shall my sword sleep in my hand till we have built Jerusalem in Albion’s green and pleasant land!’, receiving rapturous applause and a standing ovation by all in attendance.

In conjunction with this, the Government has also announced a reorientation of Guy Fawkes Day. What was once a celebration of the failure of his plot and the ultimate triumph of Protestantism over Catholicism in the isles will be changed. Instead it will be a solemn event memorializing the failure of the plot and the darkness and oppression Catholics suffered under the Anglican and Protestant heathens.

However, if the Protestants want to be oppressed then Ramsay is more than happy to oblige them. A slew of arrests have been carried out against what prominent Protestants remain in Britain. Some went down easily, being caught early in the morning or late at night while in bed. Some were surprised and taken into custody. Others however fought back like E.L.

After losing his bid for power in England, Joyce fled into the woods and fell off the map. Now he has reappeared, not in England but back in Romania. Lord Haw Haw once more rides the airwaves into British living rooms. Extolling the virtues of Romanian Legionary triumphs and lamenting the failure of the Legionary cause in Britain, Haw Haw speaks eloquently if not snobbily to a robust audience across the Isles. What former Legionaries remain in Britain have become steadfast listeners and as long as Haw Haw continues to speak the embers of Legionary thought on the Iles remain smoldering. Government attempts to crack down on the broadcasts have been met with failure as well, and have even drawn more attention to them. So, in a bid to not make them more prominent than they already are, the Government has elected to ignore them. For now at least."

His love for the desert bound equines seems to not have left him, even all these years since leaving the veterinary profession. As leader of Britain, Leese has decided that what England needs now is a new zoo, as the old one was emptied soon after the Revolution. His first purchase has, predictably, been a pair of camels from the Middle East. When the animals arrived at Plymouth Leese was there to greet them and personally inspected them, making sure they were healthy and uninjured. Seemingly spurred on by his own passion, Leese has also enacted a sweeping animal rights bill that some say is one of the most robust in Western Europe. Not only does it designate over a dozen species of animals as ‘Protected’ and therefore illegal to hunt, it also bans the sport of Fox Hunting, which had made a recent revival, and sport shooting of live birds. While this has drawn some grumbling from the upper class by and large the people applaud Leese’s love for animals and his popularity has been given a small boost."

According to the recent Decree on the Language of the New Britain, etymologists have been put to work reconstructing a complete Norman French language. By fusing what Normans survive in modern day Normandy and filling the gaps with new words the Legion is confident it can create a comprehensive language for the new State.

While the Syndicalists struggled to raise a warlike spirit, and did so to a minor extent, the fall of the Syndicalist regime let pacifism entrench itself. Now Hobart seeks to finally instill the old fighting spirit that he believes comes naturally to every Briton. On every news channel stories of British glories in War like the Battles of Naseby, Blenheim, Somme and Plassey fill every home. British veterans have been raised to a place of glory and honor and the military has been put on parade through every major city.

So he will gather a second Council of State like that which had helped Cromwell rule. This Council will be led by Hobart of course but will act more like the Cabinet than anything. It will be filled with the brightest minds of every field needed to run a state in the modern era. Economists, psychologists, social engineers, military planners and theorists of all political and theoretical leanings have gathered in London today. There they will have a Grand Debate moderated by Hobart himself and whomever he deems most convincing will be invited onto the Council. As the greatest minds in the nation begin to spar, crowds gather. Finally, after many exhausting hours the dozen men have been chosen to fill the seats.

As an important first step to kick some spirit back into the disinterested Britons Hobart has decided to instill a new Nationalism into the people. While Britons have always been proud of their country and its history, it never has been to the same degree as America or even the French. Hobart has now endeavored to change that. As the population sits before their radios tonight they will hear, along with their originally scheduled programs, planned breaks to tell the lionized history of Britain's greatest victories. Plassey, Agincourt, Hastings are just a few of the veritable cornucopia of glory that defines British history. Not only that but these stories will be angled in a way to reawaken the love of Britannia most Britons abandoned under the Syndicalist yoke, or due to the apathy around the political violence after the Counter-Revolution.

Through a combination of poking with bayonets, warning shots and a fair amount of digging Joyce is finally pulled from his hiding place after three hours of work. With the most prominent nationalist leader in exile now back in British hands, a choice has come up to the government. On one hand Joyce could be afforded the same rights given to every prisoner, political or not; a court martial. Not only would this legitimize his assured death sentence, it would let the government state their case against this dissent and traitor. Some however fear that he could use the inevitable media circus as a loudspeaker for his radical views. Otherwise we could just have him shot out of hand.

Long used in a variety of applications as beasts of burden in Arabia and Africa with the Dromedary species and in Central Asia with the Bactrian species, camel are hardy beasts that can carry well over their own weight in goods and supplies while being able to go long periods without water and or rest and susceptible to relatively easily domestication and training. As such, Leese has begun to  import Bactrian and Dromedary camels from sellers abroad in order to utilize them as beasts of burden within our supply chains in foreign theaters of war or even for use as shock cavalry in a similar fashion to the now defunct Imperial Camel Corp. Furthermore, breeding programs for these animals to be bred domestically have also been arranged, with some of Britain’s southern and far-northern pastureland being converted for usage by these foreign beasts.

Her claim to nobility is scarce, having tacit familial ties to First Lady Martha Washington, President Thomas Jefferson, First Lady Letitia Tyler, and the prestigious Harrison Family of Virgina, as well as her own respected and affluent family the Bollings. However, far more interestingly, and far more detached from the Colonial rebels that once freed America from the grasp of England, Edith herself is blood related, through her father, to Matoaka - royalty of the Powhatan tribe of American Indians through her own father and more commonly known to the world as Pocahontas. \n\nWith her closest grasp towards true royalty being her heavily diluted Native American blood, and with her previous efforts of good will, charity, and humanitarianism towards the local Native tribes along the Eastern Seaboard, Edith Wilson has decided to fully embrace this heritage. Choosing the regal name of Matoaka II, paying respect to her ancestor who married into nobility and came to England centuries before her, Edith Wilson has arrived in London to guide her newly adopted homeland and subjects towards prosperity and peace. Though she has been meant by strange stares, angry looks, and stabbing glances (perhaps from her odd attire representing a fusion of British, American, and traditional Powhatan fashion), our Queen worries not, for with her experience practically running America after her late husband had a stroke while in office as President, Wilson is perhaps one of the most experience and qualified candidates Hobart could have chosen. With her mind free of royal pomp and arrogance common in other monarchs raised for the position since birth, and dead set on uplifting her new subjects out of the violent plight and quagmire they have been stuck in for years, Queen Matoaka II - affectionately known as Pocahontas II or just Pocahontas by her subjects, meaning ‘little playful one’ in the Powhatan dialect of Eastern Alongquian - shall guide this new Britain to the best of her ability as she seeks to bring about a new Golden Age for our war-torn and beaten nation."

Although most of our British allies as well as General Hobart have urged that we keep the capital of this new kingdom and empire in London, a small clique of Americanists and ‘Native Americanists’ has arisen to oppose them. These firebrands seek to rebuild and rebrand the corrupt old capital of the failed Union that is Washington, D.C. into something far greater. Redubbing the city as Werowocomoco, their plan would have our capital and the seat of the throne and Crown moved to America, where a new capital shall be built atop the ashes of the old one. In a new syncretic architectural style fusing Algonquin, American, and Victorian British designs, this new city would be built to reflect our new syncretic and cohesive reality while also serving as the new international hub of our ambitious and hopefully expansive empire.

Not only, as they claim, does it look better, it also would be another subtle reminder to their Majesty who really runs the nation. Another proposal has also been put forward by a lesser faction of the government. It is a red field with a golden lion in it holding a scimitar. The red and gold lion is an ancient symbol of Britain, dating back to at least 1200, and the scimitar also being an ancient symbol, thought of Essex rather than England as a whole.

basedbrit.126.d:0 "While the Republican Army is a dominable force, its officer corp is not. Due to our elective officer system, the most talented are oft sidelined in favor of  the more popular. This is with the expectation of the so-called 'Old Guard.' Made up of old officers of the Royal Army, these men hold something of a special status within the Republican Army, as technically they are not even officers. Holding the position of 'Advisor' these old grizzled veterans oversee the armed forces from afar, providing invaluable advice and critiques. While this would be a fair enough situation, what worries sections of the revolutionary government are their political standings. A majority of the Old Guard, although not all, harbor a deep hatred for Syndicalism. However, many of these same men have an even bigger hatred for the Exiles and Windsors, viewing them as cowards for fleeing  rather then fighting on.\n\nChief among these men is Percy Hobart, although his position is more of a public head and spokesman, rather than true leader. Indeed, Hobart has acted as go-between for the government and the Old Guard for years. Following the Royal Family fleeing Britain on Christmas Day in 1925, many officers and units refused to lay down arms, forming a small counterrevolutionary militia. These groups vowed to fight until either the republican government or themselves were laid to rest. With the Republican Army still in disarray and lacking a true senior officer corp, a deal was offered to these rebels, join the Republican Army as special units and receive a full pardon, or suffer a traitor's death. Hobart, sent on behalf of many of these groups, acted as a middleman during negotiations. When eventually a deal was struck, Hobart made it clear that the newly birthed Old Guard harbored no love for Syndicalism. Indeed, should we ever overstep and fall to tyranny, the Old Guard would not hesitate to stand up for the British people once again. Due to the desperate need for a seasoned officer corp, these threats were overlooked.\n\nIn the years since then, the Old Guard's political stances have further solidified. While they hold no love for the current Syndicalist administration, they hold an utter disdain for Mosley and his Maximists. Indeed, in several smaller communities where Old Guard units have been stationed, Maximist leaders have been forced from power. Interestingly enough, the Old Guard seems to if not outright support, then at least tolerate the Autonomists, as Autonomists are usually placed in the place of Maximists following a 'preventive action'. Internally, the Old Guard is divided between supporters of the Exiles and those who wish to create a Syndicalist free Britain.  Despite these removals from power, the Old Guard is no true threat to the broader regime. The Old Guard has been spread throughout the nation while the most troublesome have been sent to France. These measures have been able to keep them a relatively distant threat. The Old Guard would ever be a true threat if Mosley came to power. Even then, Mosley would need to fail to purge them, while still using the army to achieve his ends. Due to the low likelihood of these events, the Old Guard is considered a low level threat by Chairman Snowden's government. "

basedbrit.127.d:0 "Today, the nation has entered a State of Mourning, as the death of King Richard IV, long expected due to his advanced age, has finally come. Although in essence only a puppet of Ramsey and the Right Club, the late 13th Baron Stafford had become a greatly popular monarch, becoming some akin to the 'Grandfather of the Nation.' Due to the King never marrying thus not having any legitimate issue, both the Barony of Stafford and Throne of the Kingdom falls to his nephew, Basil Fitzherbert. A young man, Basil has only just been wed, marrying Princess Irmingard of Bavaria, daughter of the King of Bavaria, a man who also happens to hold the Jacobite claim to England, an obvious attempt to win over the resurgent Jacobite cause within the nation. As for the newly minted Basil I, he is something of a stubborn man, used to getting his way, although he is also a man who is true to his word. Regardless, the Accession Council has formally proclaimed Basil as King, and his coronation is planned to take place within the next few months."

basedbrit.128.t:0 "An Answer to the Question of Continuity"
basedbrit.128.d:0 "As the Counter Revolutionary government furthers its control and hold over Britain by the day, the exact nature of that government remains in question. While indeed, the Windsorites and all they hold dear has been thrown off, never again to pollute the pages of history, the nation they once ruled very well might. Following the glorious coup of General Hobart and the decision to remain opposed to the Windsors, the question of the hour was if the government considered itself to be the legitimate government of a restored United Kingdom, formally dissolved by the British Revolution of 1925, or if Hobart's government was something entirely new. While very much a matter of semantics, the answer could have very real consequences on our new legal code, for if we are simply restoring a form of the United Kingdom, centuries worth of legal code would already be on the books, whereas if we are creating a new government entirely, we would need to create a legal code from basically nothing. While initially remaining silent on this fairly unimportant question due to wanting to secure the government as quickly as he can, with the nation now finally starting to stabilize, General Hobart has formally ruled on the issue of continuity. Sending a short memorandum to loyalist units across the nation from his headquarters in London, General Hobart essentially took a middle stance. In short, the memorandum declared that indeed, the United Kingdom of old had been restored, formally reinstating the old legal code. However, due to the unprecedented situation that the nation finds itself in, and with the House of Windsor vacating the Throne and their rights to it, the memorandum declared that the future structure of this restored state is still in flux. Along with this, Hobart formally, legally, asserted his right to emergency power, citing the Riot Act and the Royal prerogative(claiming that, since the Throne is vacant, those powers naturally flow to the acting Head of State.) While practically meaning very little, by making a legal case for his authority, the Junta has made a move towards legitimacy. By declaring that we indeed are a restoration, of a type, of the United Kingdom, the legal foundation of our state has been laid, making the restoration of law and order just that much easier."

They are wrong; the Labour Party is in the tradition of freedom-loving movements which have always existed in our country. I joined the socialist movement because I did not like the kind of society we had and wanted something better. Socialism is the only means of freeing the world from war and poverty. Socialism stands as a third alternative to a barbaric Totalism and Capitalism in a state of decay. Totalism is a falsification of the principles of Socialism.’, and it is by these words we now stand. \n\nShould the only good Syndicalist, ol’ honest Clem!, pursue his dream of a united anglosphere supported by Democratic Socialism and a true welfare state unfettered by the corrupt nature of Revolutionary Syndicalism, or should Prime Minister Attlee build his utopia here on the British Isles alone?"

Once ruled over by our former monarchy in a personal union under the House of Welf until the ascension of Queen Victoria broke the rules in 1837, the small kingdom was finally conquered by the Prussians in 1866, being absorbed into the Prussian system as the Province of Hannover where it rots to this day.

The idea of an Imperial Federation comprising the former British colonies has always held merit within many political advocates within the former Empire. To foster a sense of unity between the Commonwealth and the former colonies, the Lord Protector has proposed adapting the ideals of the Imperial Federation into an ‘Imperial Protectorate’ that spans the entire world, free from the clutches of the House of Windsor.

However, the most striking voice to speak out in support of the cause here at home has been the great H.G. Wells. Not only does Wells share our views of global federalism and the One World dream, even expanding on Willkie’s One World book with his own effort on the subject called ‘The New World Order’, for Wells has also long been a staunch ally of Labour that once ran for political office on our party ticket, as well as being a longtime member of the Fabian Society who in his own novel ‘The Way the World is Going’ praised a non-Bolshevik/Maximist/Sorelian form of democratic socialism, and has been a vocal supporter of Attlee’s rise to the top of the counterrevolutionary pile as well.

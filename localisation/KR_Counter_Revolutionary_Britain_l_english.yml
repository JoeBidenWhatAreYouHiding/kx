### Decisions ###
BRG_pick_a_king:0 "The British Regency"
BRG_pick_a_king_desc:0 "Assembled at General Hobart's request, the Regency Council was formed will the sole propose to find and elect a new King for the British People. With the Windsors betraying every true blooded Briton when they fled to Canada, our possible pool of Kings and even a few Queens is quite large."
BRG_pick_a_king_dummy:0 "Elect a King"

BRG_elect_wilhelm:0 "Elect the German Emperor"
BRG_elect_wilhelm_desc:0 "Ah Germany, the Global Hegemon, and our old enemy. While the history between our nations is storied and bloody, by electing the Kaiser we could put that behind us. Besides, the Entente would never risk a war with the Reichspact, thus the Kaiser would make for a very Monarch to protect our fair isles."

BRG_elect_romanov:0 "Elect the heir to the House of Romanov"
BRG_elect_romanov_desc:0 "The Romanovs, quite the strange option, but a viable one none the less. Despite losing power during the February Revolution, the honor of the Romanovs is unmatched. While never having ruled himself, Kirill is a noble man, and would make a fine King. Due to their blood relations with the Kaiser, a Romanov King could potentially see Britain in the Reichspact, if not an alliance with Russia herself, should the Empire be restored.

BRG_elect_frog:0 "Elect a Bourbon"
BRG_elect_frog_desc:0 "Despite not having ruled France for generations, the House of Bourbon still stands strong. While electing the claimant to one of our exiled enemies may seem strange, should the Nationalists in Algiers restore the Kingdom, we may be able to coax them into joining with us. If not, surly the Reichspact would accept us, if we offered to put down the Communards once and for all."

BRG_elect_bavarian:0 "Elect Rupprecht of Bavaria"
BRG_elect_bavarian_desc:0 "Rupprecht, King of Bavaria, loyal son of Germany, and Jacobite claimant to the English and Scottish thrones, is definitely not the first pick of the Regency. However, due to his German Kingship, meaning entrance into the Reichspact, along with his preexisting claims to Britain make him an appealing option none the less." 

BRG_elect_polock:0 "Elect Paweł Salwator 'Piast'"
BRG_elect_polock_desc:0 "An oddity among the claimants, Paweł Salwator 'Piast' as he calls himself, the self-proclaimed heir to the House of Piast, former ruling house of the Kingdom of Poland, was only seemingly brought before the Regency because he used to live in Liverpool. Due to the confusing status of both our own regency, along with that of Poland, Paweł, if elected, could potentially lead to an alliance with Poland. Although unlikely, we could also twist his story, and try to land ourselves in the Reichspact should Poland follow a different path."

BRG_elect_jap:0 "Elect Prince Yasuhito of Japan"
BRG_elect_jap_desc:0 "By far the most far flung option presented before the Regency Council, Prince Yasuhito is actually quite the logical choice. Due to his long time courting of British Nobility, he is  quite the familiar face to noble circles. Due to his status as Japanese Royalty, British entrance into the Japanese led Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere would be practically guaranteed. While the idea of Britain joining a military bloc half a world away might seem silly, we need allies, and Japan would certainly be a fitting one. "

BRG_elect_german_charles:0 "Elect Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha"
BRG_elect_german_charles_desc:0 "Seen as one of the most probable and likely candidates due to his preexisting claims on Britain, Charles Edward would indeed be quite the logical choice. A male-line descendent of the great Queen Victoria herself, not only would crowning Charles smooth things over with remaining Windsorite legitimists, it would cement our ties with Germany, and the Reichspact by extension."

BRG_elect_austrian_charles:0 "Elect Karl Pio of Austria"
BRG_elect_austrian_charles_desc:0 "A Carlist and Radical Traditionalist to boot, Karl Pio is not someone anyone would have thought could even be considered for King, but these are strange times. Proclaiming himself the rightful Carlist claimant following the death of Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, Karl Pio, despite his Spanish claims, is a Habsburg by birth. Due to this, by crowing him as King of Britain, we could gain the protection of Austria. Although no Germany, Austrian protection could be what it takes to ward off an attack by the Windsorites."

BRG_elect_mick:0 "Elect the head of Clan O'Neill"
BRG_elect_mick_desc:0 "Since the inception of the modern British state, the Irish have been something of a public enemy number one, thus few could expect that an Irishman could ever be seriously considered for the title of King of Britain. While Hugo José Jorge O'Neill is indeed a true blooded Irishman, he and his entire family have lived in Portugal since the 18th Century. Regardless, he is still an Irishman, and should we ever push forth our claims on the Emerald Isle, his Kingship could help smooth things over should push come to shove."

BRG_elect_christian:0 "Elect Christian of Denmark"
BRG_elect_christian_desc:0 "Even though a Norseman has not sat on the throne of Great Britain for well over a thousand years, the times of the great Viking raids are still remembered in the halls of British history. While the modern Kingdom of Denmark bares little to no resemblance to the one that once sailed and ruled the North Seas, they still exist as a sovereign nation. Despite recently pulling out of the Reichspact due to Black Monday, Denmark under King Christian X still has massive connections to the German sphere. By crowning Christian, we would be pulling ourselves into this sphere as a result, practically guaranteed our entrance into Germany's alliance, should we choose to join it."

BRG_elect_spainard:0 "Elect the King of Spain"
BRG_elect_spainard_desc:0 "With their last hopes of ruling Britain sinking with their Armada, none ever expected that a Spanish monarch could even dream of claiming the British Throne. However, with Hobart and his Regency searching every corner of Earth for a possible Monarch, and with Spain's preexisting good relations with Germany, it seems that Alfonso may have a decent shot at gaining the British throne that his predecessors coveted so."

BRG_elect_nap:0 "Elect the Heir to the House of Bonaparte"
BRG_elect_nap_desc:0 "While the House of Bonaparte as always been at odds with Britain, they still remain one of the most prestigious noble houses in all of the world. Though they haven't ruled in nearly 50 years, the ideals and glorious of the French Empire still remain with many, thus making a French restoration all the more possible. Should Napoleon be on our own throne, the chance of working with our old allies may become a reality, thus making the choice of a Bonaparte all the more tantalizing."  
BRG_elect_romanian_charles:0 "Elect the King of Romania"
BRG_elect_romanian_charles_desc:0 "King Carroll of Romania is perhaps the best example of the worst a monarch can be. His lavish lifestyle coupled with publicly flaunting his mistress makes him something of a playboy in his native Romania, a fact many cannot get over. However, Carroll also happens to be related to the Kaiser, making him a strategic, if not costly, pick for King."
BRG_elect_pasta:0 "Elect Amadeus of Italy"
BRG_elect_pasta_desc:0 "The House of Savoy, once uncontested masters of Italy, now reduced to living in exile and poverty. Despite losing power at the end of the Great War, this former Italian royalty still stands strong, prideful of their past glories. While holding little strategic value, by crowning a Savoy, we could right one of history's wrongs."

BRG_elect_swede:0 "Elect the King of Sweden"
BRG_elect_swede_desc:0 "Even though Sweden and Britain have had little formal relations over the years, Gustav, King of the Swedes, is surprisingly something of a popular choice. Perhaps reading Swedish Neutrality as flowing from the King, it is believed that by crowning him, we too would follow a path of neutrality. While this may or may not be the case, crowning Gustav would be far easier to get away then other choices for Monarch, due to his popularity." 

BRG_elect_bulgar:0 "Elect the Heir of Bulgaria"
BRG_elect_bulgar_desc:0 "Heir to the Tsardom of Bulgaria, Boris of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry is something of a moderate pick for King of Britain. As Heir-Apparent to the Bulgarian Tsardom, his crowning would both give him experience for when he becomes Tsar along with giving us a clear ally in Bulgaria. Due to Bulgaria's membership in the former Central Powers, we would have an in with the Reich, should the winds of power drift in it's direction."

BRG_elect_portugal:0 "Elect the King of Portugal"
BRG_elect_portugal_desc:0 "While having no claim on Britain itself, Portugal and Britain have been close allies and partners for the better part of the last 400 years. Due to this, what better what to cement that alliance than by sharing a monarch? While some may object, citing Portuguese flirtation with the Entente, our two nations are interlocked, and Portugal would surly join us over the perfidious Windsors, should we share a King."
BRG_elect_zog:0 "Elect the King of the Albanians"
BRG_elect_zog_desc:0 "Perhaps the newest face on the scene of Royalty, the House of Zogu, led by self-proclaimed King Zog of Albania, is shockingly quite a fitting match for our new Kingdom. While having no ambitions beyond Albania itself, with Zog at the helm, Britian would no doubt enter into a new era of glory."
BRG_elect_spanish_jacobite:0 "Elect the Spanish Jacobite"
BRG_elect_spanish_jacobite_desc:0 "A claimant to the Jacobite Succession via a bastard of James II,  Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart is in many ways the model noble. Dutifully serving the Spanish King, Jacobo, should he be elected, would fit the bill of a puppet King perfectly. Due to his place as a Jacobite claimant, he also has just the dash of legitimacy that makes him an all around perfect fit for King of Britain."

BRG_elect_franz_jospeh:0 "Elect the Prince of Lichtenstein"
BRG_elect_franz_jospeh_desc:0 "While the Principality of Lichtenstein itself is perhaps the smallest nation on Earth, it finds itself under the uncontestable protection of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Due to this, it has been suggest that Franz Joseph II, prince of Lichtenstein, be crowned as King of Britain. Should he be crowned, he could pave the way for us to join Austria as brothers in arms." 

BRG_elect_bernhard:0 "Elect Bernhard of the Netherlands"
BRG_elect_bernhard_desc:0 "Married to Juliana, Heir Apparent to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld is one of the more tame candidate to the Throne of Britain. Besides his ties to the Dutch, which could come in handy should we find ourselves in a position to ally with them, the Prince of a German noble house. Due to this, our ties to the Reichspact could be quite strong, although not as strong as others."

BRG_elect_serb:0 "Elect the King of the Serbs"
BRG_elect_serb_desc:0 "A stalwart ally of the Entente during the Great War, Serbia has now been reduced to little more than a plaything of the Austrian and Bulgarian empires. Despite this horrid defeat, the people and most importantly, the exiled King , carry on the fight even if it's only within their hearts. While Serbia may be small, and may even still be in a Regency, her King and her people would make fitting allies in the post War era."

BRG_elect_gayreek:0 "Elect Pavlos of Greece"
BRG_elect_gayreek_desc:0 "While the Greek monarchy has existed in limbo since the end of the Great War, her royal family still haunts around Europe, awaiting for the chance to return to their homeland. Despite this, one of these exiled royals, namely Pavlos, has garnered the attention of Hobart's Regency Council. Alleged to be fine with simply being a figurehead, Pavlos would in anyways be the perfect, albeit exotic, King to front Hobart's Junta."

BRG_elect_pedro:0 "Elect Pedro Henrique of Brazil"
BRG_elect_pedro_desc:0 "Despite not having ruled for nearly half a century, the Brazilian line of the House of Braganza still stands strong. While quite far removed from the affairs of Britain and culturally alien, Prince Pedro has caught the attention of the Regency due to one simple fact, Brazilian Monarchism is alive and well. While not the largest movement, the Brazilian Integralist movement is undeniably monarchist, thus making the prospect of a restored Empire quite high. If the Emperor also just so happened to be the King of Britain, than we could have a power ally indeed."   

BRG_elect_karl:0 "Elect the Austrian Emperor"
BRG_elect_karl_desc:0 "Charles von Habsburg, Emperor of Austria, King of Hungry, is perhaps the best living example of the 'model' monarch. A truly caring King who simply wants the best for his people, going so far as to sacrifice personal comfort so that his subjects would suffer less. While these are indeed commendable actions, for Hobart's proposes, they may pose something of a problem. Hobart has made it clear that he and he alone would be the true power in Britain, and to have a King who attempts to overstep him may make things difficult. Regardless, by crowning Karl as King, we would have unfettered access to the Austrian's sphere, should we choose to go that route."

BRG_elect_wilhelmia:0 "Elect Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands"
BRG_elect_wilhelmia_desc:0 "The Queen of the Netherlands, Wilhelmina, one of few woman presented before the Regency Council, is perhaps one of the safest choices that Hobart's Regency could actually make. Due to years of experience, she already knows the ins and outs of governance, she also knows when she has overstepped, meaning should wouldn't get in Hobart's way. Besides this, Wilhelmina has strong ties with the Reich, meaning that we would have an easy in with the Reichspact. Of course her being the Queen of the Dutch also brings with it the chance for an alliance with them."
BRG_elect_julinia:0 "Elect Juliana of the Netherlands" 
BRG_elect_julinia_desc:0 "Daughter of Queen Wilhelmina, Juliana is the heir-apparent to the Throne of the Dutch. Possessing many of the same traits as her mother, Juliana's reign would differ in that she would eventually become the Queen of the Netherlands herself. Also differing from her mother is her choice of husband. Also a candidate himself,  Juliana is married to Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, meaning that our ties to Germany would be nearly as strong as our ties with the Netherlands would be."

BRG_elect_maria:0 "Elect the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg"
BRG_elect_maria_desc:0 "Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess since 1912, has served her people through perhaps the toughest times in their modern history. Spearheading the movement to join the German Empire following the end of the Great War, she is perhaps one the easiest ways for us to integrate ourselves into the German sphere, short of crowning the Kaiser himself."

BRG_elect_red_woman:0 "Elect Edith Wilson"
BRG_elect_red_woman_desc:0 "One of, if not the strangest, choice presented before Hobart and the Regency, Edith Wilson, widow of the late Woodrow Wilson whom was President of America from 1913 to his death in 1923, could hardly be called a noble. While other options have the honor of being monarchs, or at least having some form of claim, Wilson lacks either of these. What she does have however, is ties to the American elite, especially the Bollings, her family by birth. She is also a descendant of the legendary Native American Matoaka - born Amonute and better known as Pocahontas, via her father. Living in self-imposed exile since the death her husband due to his Presidency being blamed by Radicals for the current state of the country, she has seemingly embraced her Native side. Touring throughout Canada, Germany, Austria and even throughout the International (which is how the Regency learned of her in the first place), she has been raising attention to the plight of the Amerindian people, and has been trying to gain any kind of help for her kindred people. In her quest, she has meet with the likes of Elwood Towner, whom, despite his radicalism, has become something of an ally of Wilson. Regardless, despite her lack of European noble blood and her crusade to better the life of Native Americans, should the right people in power at the right time, crowning Wilson could gain us allies, ones we need so desperately."

BRG_elect_sark_woman:0 "Elect the Dame of Sark"
BRG_elect_sark_woman_desc:0 "If there is any person within the British Isles who deserves the title of Queen of Britain, it would be Sibyl Hathaway, third Dame of Sark, who inherited the postion following the death of her father in 1923. Standing as one of the final bastions of reaction in the Isles following the British Revolution, she like Hobart and his Old Guard remained at her post. Due to her entrenchment on Sark, the Syndies did not attempt to remove her from power. Due to the lack of unions on Sark as a result of her rule, Hathaway has been able to keep Sark as one of the few areas of Britain untainted by Syndicalism. Along with this, Sark has established a network of monarchists and anti-syndicalists within Normandy, in hopes of one day freeing both Sark and Normandy from Syndicalist control.  While far from being anti-Windsor, she has ruled Sark in an almost neo-feudalistic style, and has gained much admiration to some within the Regency Council. However, due to her more feudalistic leanings, many in the Council fear she may butt heads with Hobart, due his preferred style of military governance. Either way, should she be crowned as Queen, her Norman contacts would be ours to use."

### Focuses ###
BRG_death_to_revoltuion:0 "Death to the Revolution!"
BRG_death_to_revoltuion_desc:0 "The British Revolution and its consequences have been disastrous for the British people. The Red Terror killed thousands, the Revolution halted centuries of civilization and without the Home Isles the Empire has been treading on precarious ground, constantly threatening to break apart moreso than it already has. Colonies in Africa and Asia were lost and those that remain have achieved a level of autonomy unacceptable in a previous age. This doesn't even mention the horrors of Syndicalist rule on the Isles. Political expression was restricted, economic growth aborted and social harmony overturned. If Hobart is to reverse the devastation he now presides over, he has a lot of work ahead of him. "
BRG_manhunt_mosley:0 "Hunt for Mosley"
BRG_manhunt_mosley_desc:0 "Arch-Traitor Oswald Mosley has escaped justice. As the leader of the Maximist Regime it was under his name that so much terror was unleashed upon the British people. Hobart has already assembled little more than a kangaroo court who sentenced Mosley to death in absentia, now all that's left is to find the bastard. Even now soldiers, police and civilians alike fan out across the countryside scouring every basement and hidey hole they can find to give Mosley a taste of real British justice."
BRG_fate_of_tuc:0 "Fate of the TUC"
BRG_fate_of_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union Congress once served as an overarching body to help organize the various Unions in pre-Revolution Britain. When the Coal Miners Strike spiraled into civil war, it was the TUC who asserted itself as leading the Syndicalist cause. It was also the TUC who committed explicit treason in forcing the British government to flee and then usurped that government’s power. Last, but certainly not least, it was through the TUC that Mosley gained power. Since the Revolution the TUC has hobbled along but is left on life support. We shall end this lingering threat once and for all."
BRG_secure_goverment:0 "Securing the Government"
BRG_secure_goverment_desc:0 "The Hobart government is a very shallow institution. While the top layer of government is filled with Hobart and his clique under them lie layers and layers of Maximist administrators. Until now Hobart has kept them in place for lack of a better option. Now both Hobart and his government have grown tired of looking at them over their shoulders. A purge shall commence and finally wipe the Red filth away from the Government."
BRG_first_eco_reforms:0 "Initial Economic Reforms"
BRG_first_eco_reforms_desc:0 "The British economy is in shambles. The policy of rampant nationalization pursued by the Syndicalists, combined with Mosley’s irresponsible militarization, has left the economy a confused jumble of private, partially nationalized and wholly nationalized businesses. This has left British industry far behind its rivals in Paris or Berlin. While a more thorough reform program has yet to take form some emergency measures can be taken to start to untangle the web and reverse the damage."
BRG_purge_army:0 "Purge the Armed Forces"
BRG_purge_army_desc:0 "While a lot of the Army officers kept their commands through the Syndicalist and Maximist purges with both their heads and loyalties intact, the same cannot be said of the rank and file. A majority of the common soldiers come from poor neighborhoods where Syndicalist currents ran deep. In the aftermath of the coup many of these Reds have formed a united opposition to the new regime called the New Roundheads. While most have kept order to some degree, mostly constraining their resistance to disobeying commanders, a few have already taken to the hills to take up arms against Hobart. If we are to secure our new state we must purge these men. They will be arrested en masse and whipped back into compliance, literally if need be. Those who already took up arms are too far gone and shall be executed."
BRG_home_countries:0 "Secure the Home Countries"
BRG_home_countries_desc:0 "With Syndicalist insurgents terrorizing the countryside the populace no longer feels secure in their own homes. They look back on the relative stability of the Union days with fondness. If we are to win the hearts as well as the minds of the people we must remedy this situation. We shall raise local militia across the nation to augment the Army which has been stretched thin. These men, while usually poorly trained, will be able to more quickly respond to local terror attacks and give people back the sense of security they long seem to have lost."
BRG_return_of_exiles:0 "Return of the True Exiles"
BRG_return_of_exiles_desc:0 "With the state more or less secure Hobart has extended an invitation for the Exiles return. However he has attached an important caveat. To come back they must renounce the House of Windsor. Hobart has decided the House of Windsor lost their mandate to rule the moment they left Britain to the Syndicalist vultures. As such they and their supporters will be barred from the Islands indefinitely. This provision was originally discouraged as many of Hobart’s advisors thought that few would take up the offer. They have been pleasantly surprised with the number of immigrants from the Entente. Hobart isn’t though. He knows as much as anybody that they are tired of war, tired of exile, tired of politics. They just want to come Home, Windsor or not." 
BRG_legacy_of_the_cavaliers:0 "Legacy of the Cavaliers"
BRG_legacy_of_the_cavaliers_desc:0 "King Charles I was a man of conviction and of true elegance. His struggle against the despotic Parliament has been unfairly demonized by British history, up until now. History has been fixed to the right view, the view that Charles was unjustly murdered by the people, led by evil men. Cromwell is not a man to look at favorably, he is little better than Robspierre! Instead the men of the Cavaliers like Prince Rupert and John Byron among others. Some will be worried that the love of a man widely seen by the public as a despot will mean, but the public will learn to think what we tell them to."
BRG_the_rebirth_of_merrie_england:0 "The Rebirth of Merrie England"
BRG_the_rebirth_of_merrie_england_desc:0 "Merry England is long gone, or at least it was. The idyllic life of a herder in a thatch roof cottage is the life we should all strive for. While industrialization has done much to build our modern world it has also done much to exacerbate our human faults as well. By rolling back the clock somewhat and reminding the people of their ideal long past we can refocus their energies away from us to achieve that ideal. If they do then that would be preferable but even if they dont they will be too busy trying to oppose us."
BRG_decentralize_guild_leadership:0 "Decentralize Guild Leadership"
BRG_decentralize_guild_leadership_desc:0 "The economy has been reorganized under a more traditional guild system since the restoration of sanity. However these Guilds have been inefficiently managed by a single Guild Master. While some of these Masters, like that of the aviation industry’s Sydney Camm, have been able and up to their task, more often than not they haven't. In any case these measures were intended to be stopgaps until a better system had been found. That system has been found through reform. Instead of one Guild Master, the Guilds will be run by Guild Councils so one man's inadequacy won't drag down the whole group."

BRG_the_organic_state:0 "The Organic State"
BRG_the_organic_state_desc:0 "The backwards lovers of perverse ‘democracy’ feel that power comes from the people who make the state act. We know that to be different. The state is an organism unto itself. It acts as it should to survive. Its organs, the people, are used by the state to fulfill its survival. This theory has never been put to the test. Through our control of the political system and our influence over the people however we have formed the world's first truly organic state. The state moves and the people react, not the other way around."

BRG_christian_unity:0 "Christian Unity"
BRG_christian_unity_desc:0 "Unity is not a given state of being. Humanity is fractious and combative. Put two men together and they are much more likely to hate each other than love each other. This fact is no less true on the geopolitical scale, especially for a state like our new Britain. A Catholic nation ruling over a Protestant populace next to a Syndicalist-Atheist revanchist regime. Already that very description illustrates the difficult position we find ourselves in. However, in faith all men may find peace and harmony. While France may be long gone, the rest of Europe are still good Catholics. By using our new found piety we can reach out a hand to the Continent and be confident that someone will grasp it."

BRG_end_party_politics:0 "End Party Politics"
BRG_end_party_politics_desc:0 "Party Politics are just a cover for subversion. By allowing them we are just begging for another Revolution. Ramsay knows this as well as anybody. As such we will do away with such petty distractions. Besides, all those other parties know nothing of what the people need, much less want. The one true voice of the people is not Labour or the Military or any other petty political theorist. It's the One True Word of God Almighty! And that word is best exemplified in the Club, led by Archibald Ramsay."
BRG_aristocratic_alliance:0 "Aristocratic Alliance"
BRG_aristocratic_alliance_desc:0 "While a broad base of popular support is assumed to be a necessity for any legitimate government, we have proven that assumption false. The people by and large hate us, or at the very least are not in favor of us, but yet here we remain. To all modern political theorists such a state of affairs should be impossible, yet we persist. That is because we have forged a strong alliance of new pious aristocrats, dependent on the state for their lives and their wealth. With such a short and tight leash they have lended us a fair amount of resources to keep the people in line. Meanwhile the people grow more and more accustomed to us. Eventually they might even love us. But that is for the future."
BRG_catholic_corporatism:0 "Catholic Corporatism"
BRG_catholic_corporatism_desc:0 "Opposed to the rampant nationalizations of the degenerate Syndicalists and the equally rampant privatizations of the effete liberals, Ramsay has found a new middle ground between the two. Industries will be organized under large Corporations as a level between the guilds and government. Not businesses in the traditional sense they will serve more as economic advisory boards for industries. In this role they will collect data, process it and then come to the best way forward as well as negotiating with any workers who resist their god given purpose to work. These corporations will also be overseen by the Church to make sure they resist the working man's natural affinity to left wing subversion."
BRG_encourage_conversions:0 "Encourage Conversions"
BRG_encourage_conversions_desc:0 "In 1534 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Act of Supremacy, forming the Church of England and shielding Britannia from the holy light of the Lord. Now we seek to correct that mistake. With Catholicism already well entrenched in the upper echelons of society we shall send out missionaries across the nation to slowly but surely reconvert the wayward souls of England. With time, patience and determination we can save England and bring God's Blessings upon it once more."
BRG_organize_the_guilds:0 "Organize the Guilds"
BRG_organize_the_guilds_desc:0 "The unions of old have been tainted thoroughly by leftist subversion. Any attempt to reform them would be at best delaying their inevitable slide back into revolutionary disobedience. To leave the worker without any way of organizing however would also bring about unrest. To remedy this situation Ramsay has decided to organize a series of guilds. Led by an elder Guild Master chosen by Ramsay, not only would he be highly skilled in his craft, he would also be responsible for rooting out syndicalist infiltration."
BRG_the_ramsay_cabinet:0 "The Ramsay Cabinet"
BRG_the_ramsay_cabinet_desc:0 "Archibald Ramsay has secured power with his Right Club. A cabal of rich former aristocrats, they have a very radical view of how this new Britain should be run. An emphasis on tradition, a new found Catholicism and a rabid hatred of Syndicalism define their views. To a nation fresh off the political whiplash of the progressive decentralized TUC which then snapped to despotic authoritarianism under Mosley, it remains to be seen just how they would accept this new radical change in direction. However, with no unified opposition to him Ramsay has a chance to change England into his idea of perfection.."
BRG_confront_the_trojan_horse:0 "Confront the Trojan Horse"
BRG_confront_the_trojan_horse_desc:0 "Chancellor Ramsay has proclaimed that Jewish infiltration has ran deep in England for centuries by now, only magnified under the Syndicalists. Ramsay has proclaimed that he knows the Jews true goals; and he will not let his new England become the Troy of the modern age."
BRG_local_authority:0 "Local Authority"
BRG_local_authority_desc:0 "The excessive centralization of the Mosley era left many inefficiencies in governance. Not to mention the top heavy expansion such a centralization forced to happen. Ramsay however sees the error in Mosley’s ways and has begun to delegate more responsibility to trusted local officers. Not only will this cut down on the size and inefficiencies of the government Ramsay has inherited, but such grace would buy the loyalty of many powerful men further securing Ramsay’s rule."
BRG_a_distributist_model:0 "A Distributist Model"
BRG_a_distributist_model_desc:0 "To the Capitalist all wealth should be in the hands of those who earned it, leading inevitably to an ultra-rich cabal like that of England before the Revolution. To the Syndicalist and the Bolshevik all wealth should be concentrated in the hands of the government, leaving nobody any richer than before and most people in fact poorer. Ramsay however wants the wealth to be given directly to the people, not to the state and not to those who no longer need it. Those who hoard too much wealth like a dragon of Arthurian legend will be forced to hand it over to the newly established Department of Equal Equity which will then distribute it to those who need it through various social programs. Some decry this as Syndicalism. Ramsay will see how much they whine when the money comes their way."
BRG_a_concordat_with_rome:0 "A Concordat with Rome"
BRG_a_concordat_with_rome_desc:0 "England lost the guiding hand of the lord almost 400 years ago. To fix this Ramsay has traveled to Rome to speak with the Pope in person to discuss furthering his efforts to re-Catholicize the Isles. His previous policies have done wonders already but without official Papal support hurdles still remain to be jumped. With the Pope behind him however Ramsay will finally have the Lord on his side and there is no mortal man who can withstand the side with the Lord."

BRG_legionary_triumph:0 "Legionary Triumph"
BRG_legionary_triumph_desc:0 "The Britannic Legion, led by the Diarchy of William Joyce and Arnold Leese have taken power through hook and crook. The nation convulses under them however. Their unstable regime faces certain destruction if quick and decisive action is not taken and fast. Already Legionary members are spreading out across the nation to fight the rioters and indeed revolutionaries who have taken to the streets. However this is just a bandaid and as the fractures on the island expand into canyons some wonder if the new Legion will be the death of a United Britain."
BRG_expose_world_jewry:0 "'Expose' World Jewry"
BRG_expose_world_jewry_desc:0 "The people need a new enemy to fight instead of us. To do this the Legion has the perfect enemy.... By directing the rage of the people at the Jews the Legion will kill two birds with one stone and stabilize the incredibly fragile situation on the isles."

BRG_patriotism_for_the_working_man:0 "Patriotism for the Working Man"
BRG_patriotism_for_the_working_man_desc:0 "The Britain of old did nothing to inspire the working man. Why would he want to save a nation who ran on his own exploitation? The Syndicalists actively worked against such patriotism to varying degrees of effect further reducing the latent love of country every populace needs. The Legion will launch a propaganda blitz to rally the nation behind not only them but as England as a whole. Posters will be thrown up on every corner, radios will cry out with patriotic slogans and in the end every man will love his country and her new protectors, The British Legion."

BRG_norman_identity:0 "Norman Identity"
BRG_norman_identity_desc:0 "The Normans were men to be proud of. Descended from the ferocious Vikings they conquered England from the barbarians and then expanded to found an Empire across Europe and the Mediterranean. Their footprint is felt everywhere you go in Europe. The Legion knows their history and wants all of Britain to be proud of it once more. A new focus will be put on study of the Normans and the Legion will work to convince all Britons that their Norman heritage is nothing to be ashamed of but something to be proud of."

BRG_the_knightly_ideal:0 "The Knightly ideal"
BRG_the_knightly_ideal_desc:0 "The knights of yore are what every man should aspire to be. Their chivalry kept them both obedient to their king and made sure the people have a defender from villainous and rapacious predators. Such love of country and our fellow man is long gone. The Legion cannot abide by this. They shall reinstill the old values of chivalry into the populace and make knights out of all worthy men. The people will be protected, come hell or high water."
BRG_one_national_struggle:0 "One National Struggle"
BRG_one_national_struggle_desc:0 "The Home Islands have traditionally acted as separate entities under the Crown or whoever sits their ass in London. This cannot continue if Britain is to face the new threats of the later half of this century. The autonomists of Scotland in particular have spat in the face of Legionary ideals. The Legion have prepared a plan using both diplomacy and tactical application of force to swipe the rug out from Scottish and even Welsh autonomy. With them finally marching to London’s tune the State will be that much stronger and our enemies will finally face a united and strong England."

BRG_rights_to_defend:0 "Rights to Defend"
BRG_rights_to_defend_desc:0 "The Man should have a right to defend himself and his property. In England and the TUC led England such violence was seen as murder full stop with few exceptions. The Legion knows this idiocy for what it is, allowing criminals to run rampant over a vulnerable populace. To fix this the Castle Laws have passed into law allowing any person who feels genuinely unsafe the right to defend themselves, with deadly force if necessary. Our critics worry this will put vulnerable minorities at risk from wanton killings but the Legion takes them with a grain of salt. These are the same liberal fat cats who bitched and moaned about rampant crime. Let them moan, they will stop when they are able to stop a crime against themselves."
BRG_an_aristocracy_of_legionaires:0 "An Aristocracy of Legionnaires"
BRG_an_aristocracy_of_legionaires_desc:0 "The old aristocratic class of England long lost their ties to the land. Instead they were just rich moochers who lived like petty tyrants and threw degenerate orgy parties. However, the Legion knows the role aristocracy plays in English society as a link to the past and the cornerstone of traditional currents in society. To marry the Legion to the degeneracy that seems natural to aristocracy a new class of aristocrats will be created. These nouveau riche will be loyal Legionaries who will police the others. Not only will they keep them in line with the new states values but they will also act as spies to weed out any plots to overthrow the state."


BRG_legionary_command_economy:0 "Legionary Command Economy"
BRG_legionary_command_economy_desc:0 "The businessmen don't work for the betterment of the country, but for the enrichment of themselves. This is a fact that everybody knows and the businessmen don't deny. Our new England however has no need of greed. To take the greed out of the economy the whole of it will be managed by the new Economic Oversight Board whose sole purpose will be to oversee the economy's function and make decisions with minimal interference from the rest of the government."
BRG_superhuman_heroism:0 "Superhuman Heroism"
BRG_superhuman_heroism_desc:0 "Britons are superhumans. No other nation could have run an Empire as big and as widespread as ours in its heyday. The French tried and they failed, the Spainards failed as well. This inherited superhumanness will be exploited to instill a sense of national pride into our people. The British will gain a fervent patriotism never before seen on the Isles. With the people so firm in their belief of their own superiority they will follow us into Hell if we order them."

BRG_the_abolition_of_unemployment:0 "The Abolition of Unemployment"
BRG_the_abolition_of_unemployment_desc:0 "The Employment Act has been put into law, mandating 100% employment. To do this however will be...tricky. The English economy still has not fully recovered from the Syndicalist taint and even before the Syndicalists it was not large enough to allow for 100% employment. To remedy this situation the Legion will open new businesses of all sizes and types to cater to a wide range of people looking for employment. Those who will resist employment without adequate reason will be simply forced to work somewhere or, more preferably, enlisted."

BRG_survival_through_will:0 "Survival Through Will"
BRG_survival_through_will_desc:0 "Britain has undergone drastic change over the past few decades. It went from a semblance of normalcy under the Crown, to anarchy and terror under Mosley and the TUC, then came to us for salvation. Through it all Britons themselves have persevered. Not because they feel like they should, but because they know they must. The stereotypical stiff upper lip has turned into an iron determination to survive any challenge, overcome any hurdle and to reach ultimate prosperity and happiness by nearly any means necessary. Now leading that charge the British Legion wields the British people like a fencer with his blade, ready to take down any foe who dare come in our way. "
BRG_immaterial_ideals:0 "Immaterial Ideals"
BRG_immaterial_ideals_desc:0 "Not all the Legions ideals are for concrete things like peace, prosperity and happiness. The Legion also embodies the new order of communal vanguardism. We will bring back the old days of prosperity and happiness and British exceptionalism. Only we can do this, not democrats and certainly not the Syndicalists. With our results proven the people have begun to come around to this view as well. We now have a solid mandate to rule as Legionary ranks swell and England marches towards a future of ensured peace and safety."
BRG_elect_a_king:0 "Elect a King"
BRG_elect_a_king_desc:0 "While Hobart has no real love of Kings after the Windsors fled with their tails between their legs, the very idea of a King in Britain remains a powerful symbol. He would be a visible and compelling figure to rally the nation around. Of course he would have no real power but his very presence would do much to legitimize the Hobart regime. To choose this new monarch however Hobart will hold an election. The Windsors of course will not be included and any write in votes for them will be discarded. They lost their right to rule when they fled instead of fighting to save the nation. Hobart will not give the nation back to traitors like them."
BRG_dissolve_political_parties:0 "Dissolve Political Parties"
BRG_dissolve_political_parties_desc:0 "To maintain a democratic facade would be pointless. Hobart is resolved to rule and if he allows the democrats to keep their toehold on the political scene then his rule will never be truly secure. Instead he will dissolve any and all political parties across the spectrum. Those who do not disperse peacefully will be rounded up and arrested en masse. If someone wants to express their political voice they can do it by enlisting. Democracy failed too many times for Hobart to give it another chance."
BRG_heir_to_cromwell:0 "Heir to Cromwell"
BRG_heir_to_cromwell_desc:0 "In 1649 when King Charles I’s tyranny grew too egregious to bear it was the military who unseated him. It was the military who led the reluctant Parliament to do what it had to do and execute the King for his treason. Then, in 1653 the Army again took the lead with Oliver Cromwell leading the Commonwealth for five glorious years. Like Cromwell before us we now lead a Kingdom without a King. Unlike Cromwell however we will be sure that the British people will never again be slaves to some man pretending at divine rule."
BRG_centralised_governance:0 "Centralised Governance"
BRG_centralised_governance_desc:0 "The Syndicalists were uneven in their rule. In some areas the state was near omnipotent while other areas went months or even years without a government official issuing orders. Hobart however will be even in his rule. All power will be centralized in London. With this comes a necessary expansion of the bureaucracy but Hobart is already writing orders to recruit a new “Army Bureaucratic Corps” to oversee the nation. With the state administration firmly in the Army’s hands it will be all the harder for any subversive elements to undercut our rule."
BRG_militaryindustrial_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
BRG_militaryindustrial_complex_desc:0 "A military without equipment is little more than a club of hooligans. Hobart knows this and has resolved to make sure his men are adequately supplied. A Military Economic Board will be established, filled with some of the largest arms manufacturers in the nation. The Board will receive orders from the military and go about seeing they be filled. Some say this is a dangerous intermingling of the military and industry and might lead to bad things down the road but Hobart is not worried. He trusts his soldiers will maintain a respectful distance for now and all time."
BRG_assess_financial_policy:0 "Assess Financial Policy"
BRG_assess_financial_policy_desc:0 "The Syndicalist economy is a mess of nationalization. Dozens of bureaus oversee every industry imaginable from bullets to condoms. This has led the system to move at a snail's pace and is rife with corruption. It's clear this system must be left with some sort of logic. To fix it Hobart has found two options that he likes best but is unable to choose. The first option is to go all in on nationalization, just give it some better organization and leadership. The second option is to re-privatize everything and take the government out of the economy as much as possible. Both of these options have their pros and cons but one must be chosen."
BRG_rigged_elections:0 "Rigged Elections"
BRG_rigged_elections_desc:0 "Its election day in Britain! The people flock to the polls to choose one of many candidates for the new Parliament. Of course however these elections were decided the moment Hobart decided to have them. The BBC already has the results even, a sweeping victory for the Loyalists! What a surprise that the results came in just days before voting began too."
BRG_awaken_british_nationalism:0 "Awaken British Nationalism"
BRG_awaken_british_nationalism_desc:0 "British Nationalism is a bit of an oxymoron. While Britons have always been proud of their country, it's never been to the extent of the Americans or Germans or hell, even the French. It was this lack of patriotism that gave the Syndicalists their opening to worm their way to power. In Hobart’s new government however the British people will find a nation to be proud of. As the French proudly sing L'Internationale and the Germans sing Heil de im Siegerkranz the British will sing Land of Hope and Glory just as loudly and will fight to defend their new nation as they do their homes."
BRG_subordinate_parliment:0 "Subordinate Parliament"

Any economic engine owned by the nation will be sold off to the highest bidder.

basedbrit.1.d:0 "The tyrannical overreaches of the Maximists had been the final straw, before Hobart had ordered the divisions loyal to him to overthrow them. The trade unionists who had been in power and hiding before the Maximists had seen Hobart’s men besieging the Maximists offices and the execution of their officials, and so foolishly came out in crowds to celebrate the change of power, expecting it was to go back to them. Needless to say that London was bathed in the same red blood of syndicalists as the banners they had waved in naivety, thinking that Hobart would really give power back to those that had failed the same revolution they preached. Now those socialists who had survived those massacres against them are in hiding, undeniably bitter and shocked at how Hobart had cleansed the slate completely of them, despite them putting their trust in him that he had come along to their ideals. \n\nYet it was not only the socialists who were thrown aside in shame, but also the exiled Windsors in Canada, who had expected Hobart to clear the way and welcome them home in open arms. They were promptly given a slap to the face when Hobart issued a decree barring them from returning to the isles, for they had betrayed the British people when they had not only failed to stop the bloodshed between state and people during the revolution of ‘25, but also cowardly ran away from the home isles. Now Hobart is standing in a very precarious and dangerous situation, for socialists and those loyal to the windsors are most assuredly plotting in their hiding. However one way Hobart can bring about a new foundation for Britain would be to invite those who despite their love for Britain had been exiled to Canada, and thus can be accepted back home."

Of course Hobart has already begun the process of accepting exiles back from Canada, particularly those who hold love for their isle and not any support for those Germans called the Windsors. Now there is as naturally expected some resistance to this and many of those stubborn conservatives remain alongside the Windsor king remain in Canada, however some political groups are willing to ditch the king and return home to join the process of creating a new system. \n\nThese two groups seeking to return home being those moderate members of the Labour party that went to Canada alongside the Exiles under Clement Atlee. There is also of course the much more nationalistic nordic following of Joyce, and the accompanying Right club under the head of Archibald Ramsey, who had converted to Catholicism in Canada due to his love and respect for the Pope’s supporters. \n\nNow Hobart must decide which group he will allow to join him in rebuilding Britain into a new and proper image.

Thus utilizing the public support for a moderate republican system, Atlee has pushed Hobart into accepting some reforms in reducing his own executive power and accepting a parliament once more. Now Atlee is arguably in control of the nation, however he cannot fully take the lead in pushing the nation towards new heights as Hobart is in the president’s seat in government, thus Prime Minister Atlee has to run ideas for reform past him in order to get it accepted, for Hobart is ever paranoid about a return to the Union or to the old system of the Windsors."

Thus Hobart has given permission for massive rallies and government endorsed spreading of the nationalist exiles messages, paving the way for the population to be swayed over to a much more state friendly mindset. Already the nationalists have hopped onto this opportunity, with Joyce’s followers already organizing rallies to hopefully sway the populus over to their newly introduced mindset, and also potentially to scare off opponents with the numbers of the nationalist attendee’s. All the while Archibald Ramsay has been creating new clubs across various british regions to hopefully spread his catholic ideals onto the more older and wealthier conservative attendee’s and any who might partake in such country clubs. \n\nAll this cannot be denied to have a positive effect in entrenching a new british state, one without the risk of syndicalists or windsors steering us astray, however Hobart watches with a worried eye as all the new praise and popularity of the current situation is going towards Joyce’s nationalists, with him who had made it possible increasingly losing public image in favor of the newly arrived nationalists."

While they bicker about the finer points differing their ideologies, their shared hatred of International Jewry and an almost rabid desire to wipe the stain of ‘Syndicalist Degenerate Progressivism’ off the Isles has united their two once disparate movements into one. Already they have made a dramatic move to remake their new and idealized Britain. In General Decree Number One both Joyce and Leese have declared the ‘Jewish Race’ to be unredeemable and a dangerous fifth column. As such they have declared any Jew caught on the British Isles after one month will be imprisoned indefinitely. This has aroused equal parts anger, disbelief and acceptance by the British population. Those following the diarchy have naturally sung the praises of this new edict and have begun to list all the Jews they know to hand over to the authorities. The rest of Britain however is confused as to why and how the edict will be carried out. The Union had a robust Jewish community. To do away with them, especially so rapidly, could only mean bad things. Already protests have begun by Jews and their sympathizers against the new decree.

However, Hobart has found an unlikely and some say undesirable ally in The Right Club. Formed by a cabal of right wing and Catholic former and current aristocracy they have found a new home in the new Britain after suffering years of inglorious exile in Canada with the rest of the British government. Now however, while Edward and his friends wine and dine in Ottawa the Right Club has come home and quickly become the poster child of the new British far right. While not as radical as some like Joyce and Leese, their traditionalist, aristocratic and more importantly Catholic leanings have turned many a common man away from them. They are a snapshot of the Britain the Union worked so hard to destroy. Ultimately the Union failed and with the death of the Union the old regime's sympathizers have come out of the woodwork to give this new right wing a serious political voice.

Through political maneuvers so rapid and cynical they would make even the most pragmatic of men’s heads turn Ramsay has rapidly outmaneuvered Hobart. Today Archibald Ramsay has been named Chancellor of Britain making him second in command of the nation. Those in the know already are aware of the general's powerlessness in the face of the Club. That leaves Archibald Ramsay and his Right Club in control of the nation and signals the ultimate conquest of England by the Roman Catholic Church. What comes next is not certain but already what Church of England officials came out of hiding have spoken of their misgivings and whispers of a Catholic restoration in England whirl like a tornado, pulling at the threads of the broad rightist coalition Ramsey leads.

However people close to him profess that from what they know of Hobart, his views have undergone a serious shift. The Hobart of 1919 is not the Hobart of now. He now has a burning hatred of the Windsors who cowardly fled England rather than face down the Revolutionaries. Indeed they speculate that Hobart has come to despise monarchy as a whole.

Ramsay has proclaimed that he will not throw Britain to the wolves just as he has taken control. To face this new ‘Trojan Horse’ as he likes to call the Jews as a group he has issued Emergency Decree One which requires all Jews to register in the new National Registry of Enemy Aliens.

He claims the reasons are for his health, which may be partly true, but it's been plainly clear for a while that Hobart has been little more than a figurehead for the Right Club. As Hobart and Ramsay fight more and more over their differing opinions it's clear that Hobart’s time in government is over. Any remaining influence he could have had over the government is long since gone and he has lost control of his own Revolution. After Hobart was shooed off the stage by Ramsay the new undisputed head of Britain made a shock announcement. He launched into a long tirade against party politics and blamed such a system for causing the Syndicalist Revolution and the resulting moral and ethical degeneration of the national politic. To remedy the crisis Ramsay banned all political parties which had been allowed to form under Hobart. He forcefully absorbed the myriad of right wing parties and banned anything any more left than him or the British Legion. Leftist leaders have been rounded up and arrested across Britain, all save for Attlee who has escaped once more. The potential for British democracy had been smothered in its cradle and as he finished his speech Archibald Ramsay, its murderer, was showered with applause."

As a way to secure their allegiance Ramsay has promised them a full and complete restoration of their rights, properties and incomes once his rule is secure. Such an offer is tempting, even to those who originally were not a fan of Ramsay. Already numerous former aristocratic families have left their exiles in India, Australasia and Canada and traveled back to the Home Islands to claim what they lost all those years ago. This ‘Great Reclamation’ has ruffled feathers as police and army units repossessed former estates for their old owners, kicking out families and businesses that inhabited them since they were seized during the Revolution. Astute observers have also noted that a vast majority of these aristocrats invited back home have been Catholics. Rumors of the Right Clubs embracing of Catholicism had been stirring since Ramsay first entered the government under Hobart. Now it looks increasingly likely that those rumors are true. Nevertheless it is much too late to turn back now. Britain is too far down their new path to turn back now."

While the TUC in the Union under Mosley kept a tight leash on most anything done anywhere in the Union, Ramsay has taken the opposite approach. Instead he has delegated more power to local governance now headed by local aristocrats. These newly empowered aristocrats have wasted little time in using their new shreds of power to reassert their own, and by extension governmental, control over the ever rambunctious lower class. This has not gone unnoticed by the once more downtrodden and already clashes have begun between remnant Syndicalists and government forces. These skirmishes are however minor and pose little if any real threat to unseating Ramsay. It's also been noticed that Ramsay seems to be giving more power faster to Catholic aristocrats.

Their heroics and tenacity were undercut by the unfaithfulness of the people who were lured away from their rightful liege by Cromwell and his cabal.

basedbrit.17.d:0 "Today Ramsay has signed the Roman Concordat in Rome with the Pope. The Concordat in simple terms brings the Church of England back under Papal purview. This has finally mended the British schism from Rome. Already Ramsay has reportedly picked out a new Archbishop of the newly Catholic Archdiocese of Canterbury, the hardline Francis Bourne. To do this Bourne has been granted significant autonomy within the Church. This autonomy however has strict limits especially when dealing with core Church doctrine. With Bourne at his back there is no doubt that Ramsay will seek to destroy the Church of England on the Home Islands and bring Britain firmly back into the Catholic world. This has been met with condemnation from across the English world. In Canada the Exiles have denounced this move in the strongest language possible and still maintain the Church of England is wholly and totally separate from Rome. The English Archbishop of Canterbury-in-Exile Cosmo Lang also issued a statement urging resistance to efforts to reconvert the Islands. This has been taken up by rag tag Moral Defense Units, little more than zealous mobs, who have gathered and pledged to resist any conversion attempts. It remains to be seen if they could live up to such lofty pledges."

basedbrit.18.t:0 "Return of the King?"
basedbrit.18.d:0 "With the last and greatest of Ramsay’s reforms done it's now time to formally induct England back into the faith with the crowning of a truly Catholic monarch. This monarch will not lead some heretical ‘Church of England’ but will act in accordance to God’s true wishes as spelled out in the Bible. Resisting both the Protestant and English heathens will be difficult but with God's grace anything can be done. Ramsay has drawn up a list of suitable candidates. At the top of said list is Ramsay himself naturally. As the man who brought England to the light of Rome it's only natural he oversaw the cementing of Catholic influence on England for all time. Despite his want for the title however Ramsay feels it improper to simply crown himself King like a common usurper. He has no royal lineage in any case. Instead he will simply take the title of Lord High Chancellor, a title of no limits which will also be bestowed upon his son or other chosen heir. This will make him a King in all but name, but by that reasoning then isn't every autocrat a King? The second choice is Edward Fitzherbert, the 13th Baron Stafford as King Richard IV. As the son of Edward Stafford he has the blood of the Plantagenet Kings in his veins. While he has expressed no explicit interest in pushing his long since thought dead ancestral claim to the throne, an offer of the crown would be hard to turn down. Another more radical proposal is to crown Karl Pius von Hapsburg as Charles III. As leader of the most radical of the traditionalist Carlist movement, he has more knowledge in how to rule a true and pious Catholic nation. Not only that but his blood ties with Austria could prove usefully, should we find ourselves adrift without allies. Another option is Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria being crowned as James III. This is a truly radical proposal and has met with severe opposition. He is a German who fought hard against British troops in the Weltkrieg. To crown him could be seen as a slap in the face of all those who fought. However, the new Britain Ramsay leads is isolated. The Entente want nothing to do with him for obvious reasons and the Internationale sits on the other end of the Channel, watching the White Cliffs of Dover with vengeful eyes. If foreign alliances are not found soon then the light of God could be snuffed out of the British Isles once more. By crowning Rupprecht, Ramsay could draw closer to the Kaiser. Strange times breed stranger friends. Also he does have a claim to the Jacobite throne, however tenuous. He is the descendent of Charles of Sardinia who inherited the Jacobite claim after the extinction of the Royal Stuart line in 1807.\n\nThe final and most radical proposal is that of Sibyl Hathaway, Dame of Sark. An applauded neo-feudalistic, the Dame as ruled her island with an iron fist, even though the hell of syndicalist rule. A convert to Catholicism following the reforms of the Right Club, Hathaway is in many ways the perfect exemplar of the Right Club's ideals and values. Unlike the other canadites however, Hathaway has no ties to any forien nation, although she had developed a Norman anti-syndicalist network during the pains of their rule. On top of this, she is of course a woman. While Queens of England are not a new concept, crowning one may be seen as weakness. Yet, it was a woman who almost lead England back into Rome's embrace, and Hathaway could be just that for us. Should she be crowned, it is expected she would take the name Mary II, to honor the last true Queen of England, and to denounce the protestant Mary II who brought not but pain to England."

In response Hobart’s aides have brought a list of nearly 30 names as suggestions for King. These range from Yasuhito of Japan to Kaiser Wilhelm. In the end Hobart knows who he chooses doesn't really matter as he will keep the power behind the throne but still, the choice would have tremendous symbolic value so it must not be taken lightly."

In recognition of his efforts Hobart has decided that Britons will never again be slaves to some King. Hobart instead has taken the title of Lord Protector and abolished the English throne. This has been met with disappointment and even anger by the rest of the Empire. They had expected Hobart to invite the King back to London but now these hopes have been dashed. Instead the King-in-Exile has released a statement declaring he is still King and that Hobart is a ‘petty usurper’ who ‘plays at King without calling it such’. This has been supported by the Entente as a whole. Despite this Hobart seems to have no intentions of reversing his decision and England sails into the future on uncertain waters."

Hobart has seen democracy in action and has seen it fail time and time again. He has resolved to not make the same mistake once more. Instead he shall create a ruling junta led by himself. No elections, no pretense at ‘democracy’. Just the rule of law and order. Some of his more liberal advisors are dismayed at his decision but there is little they could do. With his power secure and troops still in the streets the people read the announcement of the canceling of elections and shrug apathetically. They just want peace and Hobart knows that.

The people will largely steer the ship of state but the military shall retain the right to intervene should a ‘radical’ party win too much.

He had holed up with the last of his Maximists near Birmingham in an area once overlooked by police. The building he had holed up in was rather unassuming but as it was surrounded by a British Army regiment with a tank in support, it quickly became apparent that something was about to happen. As a man shouted at the building for Mosley to come out there was the slightest glint of a rifle scope in one of the windows. Before anybody could react, the crack of a rifle heralded the beginning of the Battle of Birmingham as its now called. British soldiers stormed through the bottom floor in a ferocious battle with local blackshirts as the tank outside fired multiple rounds into the upper floors, blowing away huge sections of the facade. The outcome was never in doubt however. When British soldiers finally reached Mosley’s office they found the door had been blown off when a tank shell blew through the window. They ran through to find the one time Grand Protector of the Union of Britain on the ground sobbing and grabbing the stump where his left leg once was. It was quickly located on the other side of the room. Mosley looked at the soldiers and demanded they help him “so he may face trial as befitting a British citizen”. He was promptly shot dead by Pvt James Teaton. After reading the report submitted by the regiment Hobart simply shrugged and crossed Mosley’s name off of his list. One more enemy of the state is gone."

Hobart however feels the body has outlived its usefulness. When the TUC tried to meet again today its remaining members were met with British soldiers who had chained the doors of the meeting room shut. They declared in no uncertain terms that the TUC was now an illegal organization and they had this one chance to turn and leave. If they remained they would be considered terrorists and arrested on the spot. Few delegates stuck around. Most knew this was an action long in the making and simply went home to find a new job.

Now the TUC is done and a sense of normalcy has returned Attlee sees himself and his Labor Party as the final protectors of the rights of the workers left.

With the work that came afterwards being so pressing, they were never thoroughly vetted. This has allowed dangerous elements to lurk in our power structure. These men are loyal not to the new Britain but to Syndicalism and Mosley himself. At the time it was needed as the state could not have survived if its entire bureaucratic machine was torn down at once. Now however the government has decided enough is enough.

To the public, this has been an upsetting announcement, but one that makes a kind of sense. Hobart is approaching his 60s and the stress of fighting a war, then a revolution, then a counter-revolution, and now serving as ceremonial face of the state have all combined their stress to age this poor old dog by at least a decade or more. However to those in the know within the government, it makes a different kind of sense. Prime Minister Clement Attlee has been consolidating power under himself for some time, rallying the conservative and liberal democratic opposition to Hobart. Hobart tried to spar against him and secure his seat but ultimately Hobart failed, falling to the rising might of Attlee. \n\nWith his sudden resignation, there will be snap elections for the Presidency - a new post left vacant by Hobart’s departure. These elections are merely a formality though, for Attlee dominates all with the Labour Party as the shining face of our reformed nation - the one Good Syndicalist among thousands of traitors. Behind this image, Attlee can say that he didn't partake in the horrors and excesses of Mosley or the other extremist revolution, for he was just a benign technocrat doing what he must to save his country. However, to keep appearances, a few other candidates for this largely powerless position have been raised. They are Attlee’s own Deputy Minister Arthur Greenwood, conservative Labour figure and staunch opponent to anything Syndicalist Hugh Gaitskell, or General Hobart’s protégé and close friend General T.E.

Then Attlee got them all passed. Now nobody says anything. Instead they stand in awe of the new Britain Attlee has created. The explicitly revolutionary ideology of Syndicalism has finally worked within a democratic context. The doom and gloom of the right wing who predicted a return of the Maxamists never came to pass. Yet, at the same time the far left who saw Attlee as a precursor to a return of TUC rule were also left disappointed. Instead the vast majority of Britons now enjoy a thriving democracy, a robust welfare state, workers protections unmatched in any non-Syndicalist nation and finally but almost certainly more importantly, peace. Britain finally knows peace after decades of tumult and upheaval. There are few who won't lay down their lives to defend this new peace either. "

In the halls of power there has been an incredible amount of shouting and even a couple of fist fights between the two as their political ideologies' differences become more and more pronounced. William  Joyce sees Britons as the best and most civilized nation on Earth. With their liberation from Syndicalist slavery he believes its their duty to expand across the world so that all might bathe in its civilizing light. He also believes that Britons should strive for peak physical fitness to bring out their natural physical superiority. Arnold Leese however has a different view. He believes that all Britons are imbued with the spiritual strength of the collective Aryan race. He believes that through spiritual purity part of that inherited power will be released, giving the average Briton almost superhuman strength and endurance. While Joyce believes that the Jews simply control society, Leese believes the International Jewish conspiracy extends even into people's souls. He believes that the existence of Jews corrupts the Spiritual collective of the people and acts as another suppressant of the Briton’s natural power. Joyce thinks this is all spiritualist nonsense, while Leese has begun to describe Joyce as a ‘kosher legionnaire’. In the end only one of these two can come out on top. Who should it be?"

In that time, the hope and optimism that initially followed the council's creation has fluttered away, replaced with a spirit of annoyance, gridlock, and depression. Every possible monarch that is proposed before the body was rejected, and it is was increasingly likely that a situation to liken to Poland's own so-called 'Eternal Regency' would have developed. Today however, those fears have melted away, as the Regency Council has formally announced to the nation and the wider world that a King was finally chosen! The man to become the next King of Britain is none other than Sir Sidney Robert Greville, a former servant to the Royal Household of the Windsor. Although initially fleeing to Canada along with the King whom he served dutifully, following Hobart's coup and the return of various exile Britons who denounced loyalty to the House of Windsor, Greville too would renounce his Sovereign, out of a desire to see his home before his death. Upon his return, Greville offered his services to Hobart's regime, hoping to pay back the man who had freed his home, which Hobart was all too happy to accept. Eventually going from a simple personal aid to head of staff for the entire Electoral Council, Greville was at the times the sole smile within the chambers of the Electors, as he brought and poured piping hot tea to each elector personally. This friendly repour was seemingly infectious, as somehow Greville was unanimously elected by all Electors in the early hours of the morn, just before Greville would bring morning tea as he also did. As for Greville himself, he graciously accepted the position,  promising to dutifully keep to his subjects just as he had the regency council."

His line is already related to that of the house of Windsor through distant relatives, and his English is more than fluent to appeal to the people of Britain. The man himself, upon hearing of such news from a telegram sent by Hobart’s regime was stunned. Many aristocrats in Russia and Britain alike knew of his unyielding desire to ascend to the throne of Russia, no matter the circumstances - but the throne of Britain was a different beast altogether. His arrival in the country was met with cheer and jeers all around, though confusion circulated mostly, throughout Britain and the world as a whole. This was no fever dream, however, as his coronation and conversion to Anglicanism, the first in history to be televised to the world, saw Kirill Romanov ascend as [BRG.GetLeader] , with the Romanov family standing gracefully where the Windsors once stood, more than twenty years ago.

Solemn as he may be on the matter, Vladimir’s popularity has soared following his coronation as King of England due to what many see as his reluctance to take on the duties, yet doing so with respect and pride - a truly royal Cincinnatus of sorts.

This revelation led to widespread protests from the more Anglican regions of the country and the Church of England itself, denouncing the decision as a betrayal of the 1701 Act of Settlement, and thus unconstitutional. The protests quickly scattered as Hobart’s regiments cracked down, leaving many to reluctantly accept the decision; most had accepted the decision - a sharp change in governance was not an uncommon occurrence in today’s Britain.

Before the Revolution, he had lived in Liverpool and claimed himself as the legitimate heir of the long-dead Piast dynasty of Poland; to what extent these claims were true did not matter, however. His relatively clean slate appealed to Hobart and his junta of officers the most. Salvator’s official arrival from Poland stirred little attention, many still did not believe that this nobody was truly going to become the next King of England. He was coronated the week following his arrival as Paul I, to the shock of many, especially the English aristocracy who saw this decision as an affront to their institution.

His arrival in England was met with a mixture of responses, some were eager due to the King’s reputation, others distressed at the idea of a weak king. Their thoughts did not matter - with Christian’s coronation in Westminster Abbey, he was now king of three realms; Denmark, Iceland, and now England. What this means for the people of Britain is yet to be seen, but what is certain is that Hobart’s regime has achieved the legitimacy that it desires."

basedbrit.70.d:0 "Marie-Adelaide has landed in London today to an unsure crowd who want to meet their new Queen, the first since Victoria. Queens in England always herald times of great change, historically at least. Victoria ushered in times of massive advancements, Queen Anne’s ascension united the Isles diplomatically and Queen Mary proved a firm and fair ruler to most all her subjects. This has given people high hopes for the new Queen Mary Adela’s reign. However there are still quite a few people confused as to why Mary was chosen. This confusion has seemingly extended all the way to the government. Hobart was the one who chose her and so far he has refused to explain just exactly why. All he says when questioned is “I have my reasons”. Now however it's much too late to raise much of an objection. Mary had arrived for her coronation, one expected to be a joint Catholic-Angelican affair, a first for these fair Isles. As she walked to Westminster Abbey to finish the ceremony, reports noted the look on her face. Where one might expect joy or jubilation at receiving a crown as storied and powerful still as the British one, instead she seemed not entirely happy about the whole affair. That reluctance was however short lived. After the ceremony was completed behind closed doors, the newly crowned Queen Mary Adela I of the Kingdom, or maybe Queendom, of Britain walked into the sun with a smile on her face. The crowds cheered, a 21 gun salute was given and she was gracefully led to Buckingham Palace to begin her reign."

The potential of using his claim to the Russian throne could draw a Tsarist controlled Russia closer to Britain, whether Kiril was chosen to lead the new Russia or one of his relatives. Kirill himself seemed none too plussed with the crowd gathered before him. The crowd who met him at the aerodrome was little more than employees for the aerodrome as everybody else was at work. Britain may have a King but the British people were no friends to their kind anymore. Kirill was quickly led to a waiting car which drove him down busy streets to Westminster Abbey where he was led into the Abbey and crowned. This led to the first of the new Imperial administration’s problems. Apparently, while being crowned, Kirill revealed in broken English that he was going back on his promise to convert to Angelican. He was a proud Russian and as such, a proud Orthodox. The English faith was a splinter of Rome, itself considered a splinter from the true Church by the new Tsar. There was some surprise and worried looks but eventually the Archbishop of Canterbury convinced his new King to if not convert in spirit then convert in name so they could move on. Kirill accepted reluctantly. After the ceremony Kirill walked out to find a different kind of crowd, protesters. Kirill was an avowed authoritarian in Russia, who spoke plainly of his plan to make the Tsar a strong and able monarch if at all possible. These protesters are determined not to let their new King slide them into despotism. Kirill looked at them and left without a word. It was later announced that he would take the regal name Magnus. While Hobart has assured the government and people he would keep Magnus on a tight leash, all of England waits nervously for their King's next move."

He stood before them and spoke in broken, heavily accented English, and promised peace, love and prosperity for all. The crowd received his words amicably and in the end cheered him on as he walked towards Westminster Abbey to be formally crowned. Why he was chosen has been seen as rather obvious by those in the know. His claim to the Russian throne still stands so there is a possibility, however remote, that he could become the Tsar of Russia as well and draw Britain and Russia closer together. Even if he wasn’t crowned Tsar, one of his relatives would and still draw the two closer together. Some have even suggested using his claim to the Russian throne and press it. However few believe that Vladimir would want that and even fewer believe there is a chance that Britain would ever be in a position to push the claim regardless. Instead the crowd gathered outside the Abbey as the ceremony inside dragged on and on before the doors finally, mercifully, flew open. Vladimir walked out and was met with the cheers of the crowd. He also announced himself as King Brutus III, a regal name which puzzled some. However, it has been explained afterwards that this links his line back to the legendary King Brutus I of Troy who, according to legend, discovered the Isles after the Trojan War and founded London. His 3x great grandson Brutus Greenshield ruled as Brutus II and now Vladimir carries on that noble legacy."

This was cheered heartily by the crowds who chased his car as it drove through the streets of London, electrifying the crowds it passed. When Jean entered Westminster Abbey it was said the loud noise outside made it almost hard to hear for the men inside. However, despite this interruption the ceremony was completed and Jean was crowned. He left the Abbey and it was declared that the new King of England John III Orleans would head to Parliament to meet with Hobart and discuss new legislation to clean up the slums of London.

This was met with more silence. Without a word Rupprecht was taken to Westminster Abbey where he was crowned as Robert I. When he left to greet the crowds outside he was met with a few boos but still more silence. There Rupprecht put all his speaking talents to work as much as possible giving a long and impassioned speech imploring the British people to put aside their biases and give him and his rulership a chance to speak for itself. The eyes watching him remained unmoving, some unblinking and Rupprecht smiled politely as he cheered Britain, again to no response, and was driven off to Buckingham Palace."

This has been widely seen to the rest of the world, at least what fraction of the world is even aware of his claim, as absolutely absurd since the last Piast died in the 1600s in Silesia. Nevertheless this man maintains his royal blood. Somehow this has come to the attention of Hobart who has for some reason decided to entertain his ambitions at Kingship. Some say this is proof of Hobart being mentally unsound as the new King while others suspect Hobart is just installing an easily manipulated wind vein of a man as King to allow him to manipulate him. Whatever the reasoning Pawel, taking the regal name Paul I, was crowned in a short ceremony in Westminster Abbey and was taken to Buckingham Palace which was promptly renamed Piast Palace by Paul. What comes next is anybody’s guess, including Paul's."

This fact is not lost on the crowd who gathered not only to see their King but also to see the first Asian many of them have ever seen. Using a translator Yasuhito spoke a few sentences expressing his excitement for the challenges ahead. Then he was taken to Westminster Abbey to be crowned. According to witnesses Yasuhito was visibly uncomfortable during the ceremony but seemed to grit his teeth and bear it. When he left the Abbey he was met by Hobart who introduced him to the gathered crowds as King Joshua I.

During the Weltkrieg he became estranged from the British Royal Family but now has returned to run the Kingdom he was exiled from. As a German, and a German known for authoritarian rule in his native Duchy at that, he was welcomed cooly by the populace. He gave a short speech calling back to his grandmother's vaunted legacy and pledged to continue to uphold her ideals in the new Britain he finds himself in. This drew some agreement to the crowd but as a whole they said nothing and watched as this black sheep of the family walked to a waiting car to be taken to be crowned. When he left the Abbey and was taken to Buckingham Palace he was met by Hobart. Reportedly the two got into a hour long shouting match over the role of the King. Charles expected to be given powers at least comparable to the exiled Windsors. Hobart on the other hand told King Charles III to his face and in unflattering language he was to sit on the throne and shut the hell up. The two left angry and distrustful of each other."

This was hardly understood by a crowd of many working class people whose grasp of English was dubious at times, much less of Italian and Austrian. Nevertheless the King met his people dutifully, shook their hands and even was photographed kissing a baby before being whisked away to be crowned as Charles Pious I. His speech after leaving the Abbey however was also curious. He spoke, now in accented English, about the need to ‘save Spain from anarchy’ and of his love for the English people as the ‘guardians of God and Nation’. He also began to appear to say something about encouraging Catholicism in England before being cut off. The people, not quite sure what that meant, cheered suspiciously as the King was shown to his car and brought to Buckingham Palace where he was given a dressing down by Hobart who reminded him that England would not press his claim to Spain."

basedbrit.79.d:0 "Hugh O’Neill, an Irish-Portuguese noble living in Portugal, has arrived in England to take the throne. This has been seen as an unexpected choice since Hobart has no particular love of the Irish or the Portuguese. However with one of their men on the throne the new England could draw closer to both nations. This fact is probably not lost on Hobart. The King, for his part, after being crowned King Loigaire I, has sent suggestions to Hobart for doing just that. His first suggestions were state visits by him to both Dublin and Libson. The visit to Portugal he claims is to gather up the last of his things as well as to strengthen ties between Portugal and England. His visit to Ireland however has taken on a special significance to the King. Having never spent much time in Ireland as a boy and up until now, he seems almost desperate to reconnect with his Irish roots. While Hobart can’t find any real reason to deny the King this request it does make him nervous. Hobart might have his own designs on Ireland and to send the King on a friendly visit only to follow it with an invasion could seriously hurt the King's use as a diplomatic tool and therefore defeat the purpose of crowning a King at all. As Hobart works to untangle this newest of headaches the new King settles into his new lodgings in Buckingham."

Christian spoke little to the crowd, a few thanks here and there to individuals as he shook their hands, before going to his coronation as King Christian I. Then he went straight to Hobart’s office in the War Office Building. While the exact wording of the meeting is lost to history it can be assumed that Christian demanded more say in the running of the Kingdom. Hobart however seemed unwilling to give the Kingdom away to ‘the fickle wills of a blue blood’ once more. After a seemingly spirited debate the King marched off in a barely contained rage. Hobart for his part seemed to not dwell too much on the confrontation, returning to work as if nothing happened. However the precedent was set and there is little doubt this would not be the last time the King would try to assert the power he feels he is entitled to."

Alfonso paid them no mind however, their alternating faces of contempt and curiosity reminded him of home. As Alfonso reached the car prepared to take him to Westminster Abbey to be crowned as Alfred II he had a faint hope that England would be better than Spain. Back home he was the target of almost constant conspiracy for assassination or removal. Here, he hoped he might find peace. However, as the car approached Westminster Abbey the crowd before it suddenly parted as a man charged forwards with a pistol. 'Goddamn bloody Syndicalist fuckhead!' The driver yelled as he suddenly slammed on the gas and the car shot away. As the car bobbed and weaved through the crowded London streets towards Buckingham Palace and presumed safety Alfonso couldn’t help but sigh. It seems England is just like Spain after all.

Instead his exile in National France bred an intense lust to reclaim France from the Syndicalists and emulate his famous ancestor Napoleon I. However, now that he is here Napoleon has seemingly accepted his lot in life and appears to have accepted his rule. However, after a short crowning as Louis II (counting the short lived claim by Louis Capet who landed in England and claimed the throne as Louis I in the early 1200s), he told Hobart and indeed the entire country in a radio address that he would work to liberate France from the Syndicalists. While he acknowledged that he had little power here he hoped he could convince the British people of the necessity of crossing the Channel to destroy the Red Menace. This has aroused a newfound hatred of Syndicalism that Hobart’s coup had instilled in the people. At the same time however Hobart has his own plans which might or might not include an invasion of France. Despite this Napoleon has settled into his new home in Buckingham and has reportedly taken notice of the irony of the first Napoleon trying and failing to invade England and now the fourth Napoleon is trying to invade France from England."

Nevertheless he arrived at Westminster Abbey and was crowned King Charles III. However, when he attempted to leave Britain and head back to Romania he was stopped by Hobart. Hobart explained that now that he was here, if he left so quickly he could never come back. The people would see it as another abandonment and would not only replace him, but replace Hobart as well with another Syndicalist. Hobart instead had Charles III driven to Buckingham Palace where he was placed under close guard. Charles protested vigorously but there was little he could do. The Romanian government has cut off all relations with Britain until their King is returned but Hobart insists Charles wants to stay. Despite Hobart’s posturing, all who know Carol know he wants to go home but instead Carol is stuck in a land he cares nothing for, hostage to a bigger power. Interestingly enough, since being locked in Buckingham, various dishes, silverware and glasses have actually gone missing. When pressed, the King plays dumb, denying any knowledge of what is being asked of him. Although several aids have reported seeing the King pocket things like forks, and even with a spoon once actually falling out of his pocket, his staff continue to play the fool.

He spoke in accented English about the value he always put on British civilization and swore to uphold the sanctity of the English crown by his actions as well as words. The crowd, who were at first unsure, now accepted their new King with all their hearts. They cheered him on and showered him with love and praise, a love he returned to his people. He arrived in Buckingham Palace and immediately sent for a language coach to more perfectly speak the language of his people. Indeed Amadeo seemed to really take to Kingship when, in a speech delivered over the radio later in the day, he declared his intention to found the King Amadeus I Charity for the Help of the Africans which would collect money to help the natives of MittelAfrika.

He didn't speak much English, didn’t know any English history besides what was necessary, and was descended from a French Marshal who fought the English to great success. Now here he was taking their crown. The irony tasted bitter in his mouth. A part of him wanted to turn back now, get on that plane and never look back. However he sensed a real opportunity. Hobart explained his plans for Britain and its expansion back into the Empire. If all went to plan Gustav, now Cnut II, calling back to the illustrious founder of the North Sea Empire, will be at the head of an Empire larger than his namesake could ever dream. Sure Hobart was thinking that he would use the old monarch as little more than a figurehead but Gustav has been at the political game far longer than Hobart. Like the proud lion he shall wait in the reeds and when his time comes, he will slaughter the cow and take his prize.

Boris was a revanchist in a nation lacking in lost land. Instead of the lost lands of the ancestral Bulgars that he used to tempt his countrymen back home however, he instead used the lost temptation of the Empire to whip the crowd into a patriotic rage. He raged with them, but a different kind of rage. He raged not against the Empire he never ruled or cared for, but for being stuck in this godforsaken hell hole. Sure he was making the most of it but this was hardly his first choice of crown. Instead, as his speech died down and Boris made the trek to be crowned Boris I of Britain he pictured seizing control of the state from that dinosaur Hobart and wielding the combined Britannic-Bulgar alliance as a bludgeon to secure Bulgarian dominance in the Balkans for all time.

Yet here he was, standing in the cold air to a people he never intended to rule. Duautre silently walked to the car to be taken to the Westminster Abbey and be crowned King Ferdinand I of Britain. What he planned to do afterwards however was anybody’s guess. Duautre himself wasn’t quite sure. Hobart was clear in his powerlessness politically. Maybe he would go home to Lisbon and never come back. Maybe he would stay in London and never go back to Lisbon.

Zog himself was skeptical whether Hobart actually would honor such a guarantee but what Zog was not skeptical of was its power. For all its instability the British Army was still a weapon to be feared, and all the Balkans knew it. Even the threat of British intervention would be enough to scare off the vultures eternally circling his nation. And besides, England was a lot more to Zog’s liking than he openly admitted.

It took a call from Hobart to convince him of both the authenticity of the offer and to accept it. Now here he was, in a land he didn't know claiming a throne he never really wanted. He had also been getting some offers from a cabal of American fanatics to come take over there as well. He turned them down though, he knew what America did to Kings.

So Alexander made no pretensions of his intentions. Instead he quickly allowed himself to be crowned and by the end of the day was already back in the air.

Most local level officers have been relived of command, due to the new generation having grown up in the shadow of Syndicalist tyranny. For our senior officers, most actually belonged to the various anti-syndicalist cliques, but this is not the case with all of them, one of the prime examples being Thomas Edward Lawrence. Lawrence, a veteran of the Great War, and the man who led Arab tribes in revolt against the Ottoman Empire, has up to now been neutral. Despite having served the Windsorite Empire, he stayed put in Britain, offering his services to the new Revolutionary government, much like General Hobart. Unlike Hobart however, Lawrence never joined a clique or made an effort to express his political leanings, this however, has changed. Upon learning of the ongoing review of the officer corps, Lawrence officially declared his totally and undying allegiance to Hobart and his new government. Explaining away his previous apathy by saying he simply did not wish to see his home hurt enough more, he declared in no uncertain terms that he was never a socialist.

In fact, Hobart officially declared that should he die untimely, Lawrence would be his successor, practically making the second most important man in the nation, behind Hobart himself. While this relationship is quite strong, and despite the fact Lawrence is his heir-apparent, Hobart has not gone as far as to officially give Lawrence a seat in government.

As since the announcement to even today, the people have request, or more aptly put, demanded, snap elections. Either by sending letters to Hobart, protesting in the streets and in a few very minor cases even taking up arms, it seems the return of Democracy has brought about a revival of the British spirit of protest. With the protests growing to such a strength, it is obvious we can no longer ignore them. Before Hobart lies two options. He can either cave to the demands of the protests and call for snap elections, thought these would obviously be closely monitored, and radical parties and their supporters would be bared from taking part. The other option is to simply crack down on these fools. While yes, it would hurt us in the short term, it would show the people who is really in charge in this country.

However, as a show of goodwill, Hobart has announced that which ever party wins a majority, shall have the power to replace Austen Chamberlain if they should wish too. In the running this year are 5 major parties, although smaller nationalist ones also exist. The first is Hobart's own United Briton Party, formed a short time ago to legitimize his rulership. Also in the ring is the Conservative Party, which while not as strong as it once was, has been greatly emboldened by the return of the True British exiles. Another Party running is the National Liberals, a more conservative while still economically liberal breakoff from the Liberal Party, which is also in the running. Finally, there is Labour, which while having to boot it's more radical wing, is still perhaps the most strong party in the elections, due to being the most leftist party allowed to run.

Featuring modified armored vehicles sourced from our allies and contacts in nations such as France, Italy, Russia, and the Americas each modified and outfitted to perform a specific task, these Funnies have proven themselves time and time again. \n\nFeaturing tanks with scorpion or crab flails mounted to the front to clear mines, tanks with mounted flamethrowers that either tow a fuel tank or keep one internally depending on the model, tanks with bulldozers to clear obstacles like hedgerows and barricades, tanks with massive mortars instead of a main gun for busting bunkers, bridge-laying tanks, amphibious tanks like the Duplex Drives, fascine tanks, ramp tanks, searchlight-equipped tanks, plough tanks, onion mine layers and more, the list of Funnies never ceases to expand as Hobart and his Engineers crack on with their ingenious work. Utilized by our division both at home and abroad, and also sourced to our allies, these ‘Hobart’s Funnies’ are sure to aid any current or future war efforts as we continue to modernize our armed forces in an endless bid to win the global arms race."

Secretly aiding Hobart in his counter-revolutionary efforts while feeding info to Attllee and other resistance members, Blair did all he could, but many still view him as a traitorous Red. \n\nWith their close friendship still lingering and with Attlee’s unmatched power as Prime Minister, some have proposed that Clem should pardon Blair, either forcing him into an early retirement so long as he limits the inflammatory nature of his literature or giving him a position under Attlee where he can be easily monitored. However, more staunch anti-Syndicalists and Labour opponents state that despite Blair’s petty attempts at stopping Mosley, he still was a Revolutionary traitor, and as such, he deserves nothing less than life in prison.

We shall deal with these strikers with a velvet glove dyed red instead of the iron fist, for it is the only way to prevent history from repeating itself.

After over four minutes of this dense speech ridiculing our past failures while promising new futures, Attlee ended the speech with the triumphant and trumpeting line ’I will not cease from mental strife, nor shall my sword sleep in my hand till we have built Jerusalem in Albion’s green and pleasant land!’, receiving rapturous applause and a standing ovation by all in attendance.

Instead it will be a solemn event memorializing the failure of the plot and the darkness and oppression Catholics suffered under the Anglican and Protestant heathens.

Extolling the virtues of Romanian Legionary triumphs and lamenting the failure of the Legionary cause in Britain, Haw Haw speaks eloquently if not snobbily to a robust audience across the Isles. What former Legionaries remain in Britain have become steadfast listeners and as long as Haw Haw continues to speak the embers of Legionary thought on the Iles remain smoldering. Government attempts to crack down on the broadcasts have been met with failure as well, and have even drawn more attention to them.

His love for the desert bound equines seems to not have left him, even all these years since leaving the veterinary profession. As leader of Britain, Leese has decided that what England needs now is a new zoo, as the old one was emptied soon after the Revolution. His first purchase has, predictably, been a pair of camels from the Middle East. When the animals arrived at Plymouth Leese was there to greet them and personally inspected them, making sure they were healthy and uninjured. Seemingly spurred on by his own passion, Leese has also enacted a sweeping animal rights bill that some say is one of the most robust in Western Europe. Not only does it designate over a dozen species of animals as ‘Protected’ and therefore illegal to hunt, it also bans the sport of Fox Hunting, which had made a recent revival, and sport shooting of live birds. While this has drawn some grumbling from the upper class by and large the people applaud Leese’s love for animals and his popularity has been given a small boost."

According to the recent Decree on the Language of the New Britain, etymologists have been put to work reconstructing a complete Norman French language. By fusing what Normans survive in modern day Normandy and filling the gaps with new words the Legion is confident it can create a comprehensive language for the new State.

As such, Leese has begun to  import Bactrian and Dromedary camels from sellers abroad in order to utilize them as beasts of burden within our supply chains in foreign theaters of war or even for use as shock cavalry in a similar fashion to the now defunct Imperial Camel Corp. Furthermore, breeding programs for these animals to be bred domestically have also been arranged, with some of Britain’s southern and far-northern pastureland being converted for usage by these foreign beasts.

Having served in the Great War, since his rise as head of the French Capetians he worked tirelessly to propose an alternative to the failing republic, yet he would answer the call of Hobart, becoming the first French of King of the Britons. But the burden of his increased responsibilities proved too much to bear for the monarch, already deeply affected by defeat and exile, and his health had been on a steady decline for some time. The dauphin had stepped in to relieve his father but this wasn’t sufficient, and those in the know knew that the passing of the King was only a matter of time. Part of John II’s dream to see his kingdom restored had come true, and with his family attending to him in his last moments, particularly his son the dauphin and his grandson Henri, he knew that the future was assured, that he was leaving the kingdom in good hands, that France would soon be freed, that all the sacrifices endured by his people and by himself had not been in vain, that, at last, he could rest.\n\nA week of national mourning has been decreed, at the end of which King John will be buried.

With this being the case, Carroll has retreated to our shores, hoping that he can find refuge in a land he at least is nominally the King of.

Now with his return, a question has been raised regarding his future as our King. While obviously he is the legal King, he no longer rules Romania, loosening our ties and thus putting our future relationship into jeopardy. With this being the case, many have suggested that we do away with Carroll, and crown his son, thus strengthening our ties to Romania.

Her claim to nobility is scarce, having tacit familial ties to First Lady Martha Washington, President Thomas Jefferson, First Lady Letitia Tyler, and the prestigious Harrison Family of Virgina, as well as her own respected and affluent family the Bollings. However, far more interestingly, and far more detached from the Colonial rebels that once freed America from the grasp of England, Edith herself is blood related, through her father, to Matoaka - royalty of the Powhatan tribe of American Indians through her own father and more commonly known to the world as Pocahontas. \n\nWith her closest grasp towards true royalty being her heavily diluted Native American blood, and with her previous efforts of good will, charity, and humanitarianism towards the local Native tribes along the Eastern Seaboard, Edith Wilson has decided to fully embrace this heritage. Choosing the regal name of Matoaka II, paying respect to her ancestor who married into nobility and came to England centuries before her, Edith Wilson has arrived in London to guide her newly adopted homeland and subjects towards prosperity and peace. Though she has been meant by strange stares, angry looks, and stabbing glances (perhaps from her odd attire representing a fusion of British, American, and traditional Powhatan fashion), our Queen worries not, for with her experience practically running America after her late husband had a stroke while in office as President, Wilson is perhaps one of the most experience and qualified candidates Hobart could have chosen. With her mind free of royal pomp and arrogance common in other monarchs raised for the position since birth, and dead set on uplifting her new subjects out of the violent plight and quagmire they have been stuck in for years, Queen Matoaka II - affectionately known as Pocahontas II or just Pocahontas by her subjects, meaning ‘little playful one’ in the Powhatan dialect of Eastern Alongquian - shall guide this new Britain to the best of her ability as she seeks to bring about a new Golden Age for our war-torn and beaten nation."

basedbrit.121.d:0 "With the historic homeland of the Powhatan confederation, Tsenacommacah, now firmly under our control, a question of where our capital should lie has arisen within our court. Although most of our British allies as well as General Hobart have urged that we keep the capital of this new kingdom and empire in London, a small clique of Americanists and ‘Native Americanists’ has arisen to oppose them. These firebrands seek to rebuild and rebrand the corrupt old capital of the failed Union that is Washington, D.C. into something far greater. Redubbing the city as Werowocomoco, their plan would have our capital and the seat of the throne and Crown moved to America, where a new capital shall be built atop the ashes of the old one. In a new syncretic architectural style fusing Algonquin, American, and Victorian British designs, this new city would be built to reflect our new syncretic and cohesive reality while also serving as the new international hub of our ambitious and hopefully expansive empire. However, such a move would be as expensive as it would be controversial, so perhaps it would be best if Queen Matoaka II stayed here in London."
basedbrit.121.a:0 "We must stay in London, for that is where the heart of our new people lies."
basedbrit.121.b:0 "To Werowocomoco! We shall rebuild Washington to be a new capital of the new Powhatan!"

basedbrit.122.t:0 "A Matter of Flags"
basedbrit.122.d:0 "Hobart recognizes the appeal of a good flag. A good looking flag draws the eyes of everybody around and inspires patriotism. Now that we have a monarch the flag is just the monarch's Coat of Arms on the Union Jack. This is acceptable to obviously the monarch and some of the population. However the Army has its own flag, a flag it had used before the monarch came. Some within the Army wish for the flag to return. Not only, as they claim, does it look better, it also would be another subtle reminder to their Majesty who really runs the nation. As a compromise some have come forward with a third design combining elements of the Union Jack and the Army Flag. They argue it is a synthesis design to show the Army and Monarch ruling the nation together as one. A fourth proposal has also been put forward by a lesser faction of the government. It is a red field with a golden lion in it holding a scimitar. The red and gold lion is an ancient symbol of Britain, dating back to at least 1200, and the scimitar also being an ancient symbol, thought of Essex rather than England as a whole. Nevertheless with this flag it will show we are all still Britons, Monarch, Army and all, while also serving as an important link to our ever glorious past."

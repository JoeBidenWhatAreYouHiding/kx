### NAVAL DOCTRINES
###
### How to use these scripted triggers:
###
### These are only necessary if your country has a choice of naval doctrines in its focus tree - it will prevent the AI from researching
### a doctrine if it doesn't get bonuses for that doctrine, or prevent it from taking focuses for a doctrine if it's already researched a different
### one on its own. Note that it doesn't make a country more or less likely to research specific doctrines - that's all handled in the
### ai_will_do's in the technology files
###
### 1) if your country has a choice between doctrines, put their tag in the "never_research_XXX" list for doctrines it shouldn't research at all
### 2) for the doctrines your country can take, put it in the "dont_research_XXX_if_choicemade" lists - with whatever conditions/focuses
###	that should prevent it from taking that (ie. when the focus for another doctrine has already been taken)
### 3) add the "already_has_doctrine_XXX" into the ai_will_do for any focuses where the choice would be made, which prevents the focus
###	from being taken by the AI if it's already researched it
###
### If you want the country to *never* research a doctrine until a focus has been taken, it needs to follow steps #1 and #2 above, and the
### "dont_research_XXX_if_choicemade" lists should instead include the conditions that should stop it from researching (such as
### "NOT = { has_completed_focus = RUS_reform_markov }" ...meaning once RUS_reform_markov has been taken, the doctrine can now be researched

As we strive to rebuild Rome, free from Republican and Imperial structures, many have suggested that we adopt the very tongue of that which we seek to revive. While purifying and rediscovering Latinâ€™s true sense will take time, no doubt it will be worth it. Rome Eternal must shine again, and that shine can only be completed with the restoration of the mother language."

Only one place on Earth, that being the Papal States, has Latin as an official language, but even then most of the population only speaks Italian. With the ascension of the radical wing of the Knights of Malta, this will no longer remain the case. Latin shall become the official language of the Maltese people, and the Holy Tongue shall once more be spoken freely and plainly in the streets!"

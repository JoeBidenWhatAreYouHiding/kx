#Adjacency rules are special rules for adjacency
#If somebody who is at war fights over canal/strait it is considered closed
#Enemy status is considered if any of sides controlling the channel is at war with country
#Friend status is considered non of sides controlling the channel is at war with country and one of controllers is ally of giving military access
#Every one else is considered as neutral according to canal/strait
#Military access considered as being friend
#Rules needs linking from the straits that are affected by the rule ( adjacency_rule_id )

#Name is how you refer to the rule in adjecencies.csv

#Extra notes from the KR team:
#We've put them into 4 groups, going from most open to least open
#Group 1 are large straits, they allow subs through if contested or enemy, everything through as friend or neutral
#Group 2 are small straits, they allow nothing through if enemy, subs through if contested, everything through as friend or neutral
#Group 3 are canals with special treaties in place, they allow nothing through if contested or enemy, everything through as friend or neutral
#Group 4 are regular canals, they allow nothing through if contested or enemy, only trade through if neutral, everything through as friend
